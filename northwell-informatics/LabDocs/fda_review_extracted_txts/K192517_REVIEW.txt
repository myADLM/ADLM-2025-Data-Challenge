III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Psychemedics Microplate EIA For Cotinine in Hair is an in vitro diagnostic device for the
qualitative detection of cotinine in human head and body hair as an aid in the detection of
cotinine after use or exposure to tobacco products. The assay is intended for a single site and
uses a cutoff calibrator of 200 pg cotinine/mg hair. This device is intended exclusively for
Psychemedics use only and is not intended for sale to anyone.
The Psychemedics Microplate EIA For Cotinine in Hair provides only a preliminary analytical
test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Liquid Chromatography/Mass spectrometry/Mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is
the confirmatory method used by Psychemedics Corporation. The LC/MS/MS analysis uses a
cutoff, after extensive washing of the hair, of 100 pg cotinine/mg hair with presence of
hydroxycotinine at or above 10 pg/mg hair.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The Psychemedics Microplate EIA For Cotinine in Hair assay requires a Microplate Reader with
450nm and 630 nm wavelength absorbance capability.
The confirmation assay uses an AB Sciex API-3200 LC/MS/MS linked to a Shimadzu LC20-AD
binary pump system with a CBM 20A communications bus module and a DGU-20A5R
degassing unit. The autosampler is a PAL- HTC-xt.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Cotinine in Hair is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the
preliminary qualitative detection of cotinine in human hair samples using a 2.0 ng cotinine/10
mg hair (200 pg/mg hair) cutoff for the purpose of identifying nicotine use. To confirm a
preliminary positive result for the presence of cotinine, LC/MS/MS must be used in addition to
this preliminary test.

The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Cotinine in Hair assay consists of:
• BSA-cotinine coated Microplate
• Cutoff calibrator and the controls around the cutoff
• Primary antibody against cotinine
• HRP-labeled secondary antibody directed against the primary antibody species
• Substrate TMB (tetramethylbenzidine)
• Acidic stop solution (2 N HCl)
The confirmation assay consists of calibrators and an AB Sciex API-3200 LC/MS/MS linked to a
Shimadzu LC20-AD binary pump system with a CBM 20A communications bus module and a
DGU-20A5R degassing unit. The autosampler is a PAL- HTC-xt.
B Principle of Operation:
The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Cotinine in Hair is based upon the competitive binding
with the antibody to cotinine in the sample and solid-phase cotinine in the microplate wells, in
proportion to their relative concentrations.
Hair samples are cut as close as possible to the skin, packaged and shipped at ambient
temperature to the laboratory, where they are digested in a solution containing 0.3%
dithiothreitol at pH 9.5 for two hours, then neutralized. Hair sample extracts and primary
antibody are combined in the wells (coated with cotinine-BSA conjugate) and incubated. After
washing, secondary antibody-HRP is added and the plate incubated 1 hour. After washing,
substrate is added, and, after a final incubation, the wells are acidified and read with the
microplate absorbance reader at 450 nm with background set at 630 nm. Results are normalized
by expression as B/B0 x 100. If cotinine is present in the sample, less primary antibody will be
bound to the solid-phase antigen, thereby resulting in less binding of HRP-labeled secondary
antibody; the absorbance produced is inversely proportional to the amount of cotinine in the
sample (specimen, calibrator or control).
For samples that are presumptive positive by the screening assay, a new aliquot of the hair
sample is weighed, washed extensively to remove externally-derived cotinine, extracted by a
different procedure, and confirmed by LC/MS/MS for the presence of cotinine and
hydroxycotinine.

2. Linearity:
The screening immunoassay is a qualitative test only; therefore, a linearity evaluation is not
applicable.
Linearity of the LC-MS/MS confirmation method
The linearity of the confirmation method was evaluated by spiking cotinine and
hydroxycotinine into negative hair over the range of 0 to 1000 pg/mg hair. Eleven
concentrations within this range were evaluated (0, 10, 20, 35, 50, 80, 100, 300, 500, 700,
1000 pg/mg hair). All levels for cotinine and hydroxycotinine demonstrated percent
recoveries within +/- 15% of the expected value.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Specificity of the immunoassay screening method
Immunoassay: Cross-reactivity with structurally related compounds
The cross-reactivity characteristics of the screening immunoassay was evaluated by spiking
various concentrations of cotinine into drug-free hair samples and comparing the result to the
cutoff calibrator. The table below lists the percent cross-reactivity and the approximate
concentration of each compound required to produce a response approximately equivalent to
the cutoff concentration of the assay.

Immunoassay: Effect of cosmetic treatments
Hair samples negative for cotinine and samples positive for cotinine were treated with the
following cosmetic treatments: permanent wave, relaxer, dye (which includes bleach), and
shampoo. After the treatments, these samples and an aliquot of the same hair samples
untreated were digested for cotinine analysis and then assayed by the Psychemedics
Microplate EIA for Cotinine in Hair. The EIA results with and without treatment are
compared to detect interference in the assay or loss of drug due to the treatments. The study
included 5 negative samples and 6 previously confirmed cotinine-positive samples with each
type of treatment. Negative hair samples remained negative and positive samples remained
positive after treatment with the cosmetic products for dye, shampoo, perm, or relaxing.

Specificity of the LC-MS/MS method
An interference study was conducted for the LC-MS/MS method by spiking potential interferents
into hair specimens containing cotinine and hydroxycotinine, and the results were compared to
hair specimens containing cotinine and hydroxycotinine without potential interferent. There was
no significant interference from potential interfering compounds (cotinine and hydroxycotinine
were present at 40 pg/mg hair), as shown in the below table.

LC-MS/MS: Studies to evaluate environmental contamination
Studies were performed to evaluate environmental contamination. Seven samples of cotinine-
EIA-negative hair locks were suspended in a large Erlenmeyer flask equipped to draw smoke
through the flask from a burning cigarette. All of the washed samples had cotinine less than 100
pg/mg hair.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable. The screening immunoassay is a qualitative test only.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Controls and calibrators are prepared as a methanolic solution containing cotinine and are
traceable to certified cotinine and hydroxycotinine reference materials. Cotinine in methanol
was shown to be stable up to 11.5 months.
Sample shipping and storage stability: Six samples containing cotinine (Samples were stored
at ambient temperatures in the same collection foil and card-envelope in which they were
placed at time of collection) were shipped overnight to another location and returned to the
original location by overnight shipping. Six additional samples were tested before and after
storage at ambient temperatures for 65 days. Samples were tested by the routine LC-MS/MS
procedure both before being shipped and after returning to Psychemedics.
Neither shipping, nor storage for over 2 months, caused significant change in the cotinine
EIA results.

6. Detection Limit:
The screening immunoassay is a qualitative test only; therefore, a detection limit evaluation
is not applicable. See section VII.A.1. above for sensitivity around the immunoassay device
cutoff.
Detection Limit of the LC-MS/MS method
The sponsor performed a study to determine the Lower limit of Quantitation (LLOQ) of the
LC-MS/MS assay for cotinine and hydroxycotinine.
The LLOQ is the lowest concentration that meets chromatographic and retention time
criteria, and that can be quantitated within 20% of the expected value. The method LLOQ is
10 pg/mg hair for cotinine and hydroxycotinine.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in precision
section VII.A.1 above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison:
Accuracy of the immunoassay screening method
A total of 153 samples were utilized for this study. Subjects were identified for inclusion in
the study by screening using an independent screening assay (cotinine in oral fluid). The hair
samples were then tested using the Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Cotinine in Hair assay
and the Psychemedics LC-MS/MS confirmatory assay, results from both methods were
compared. The comparison of Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Cotinine in Hair assay with
LC-MS/MS confirmatory assay is shown in the following table.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
2. Clinical Specificity:
Not applicable.
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
A balanced selection of scientific literature was provided to support the clinical validity of
the cutoff, supporting that the device, as designed, can detect the approximate equivalent of
one (1) cigarette smoked per day, every day. In addition, a clinical study was conducted in
which 25 non-smokers were recruited, who were exposed to second hand smoke daily in the
home setting. The amount of cotinine in the hair of all study subjects was below the
confirmatory cutoff for the device, supporting that incidental exposure in these individuals
did not result in high enough cotinine hair concentrations to be considered a positive result.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Not applicable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
