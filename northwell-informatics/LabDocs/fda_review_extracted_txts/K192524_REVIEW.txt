B Indication(s) for Use:
Lumipulse G CA15-3 is a Chemiluminescent Enzyme Immunoassay (CLEIA) for the
quantitative determination of CA 15-3 in human serum or plasma (sodium heparin, lithium
heparin, or dipotassium EDTA) on the LUMIPULSE G System.
The assay is to be used as an aid in the management of patients previously diagnosed with stage
II and III breast cancer. Serial testing for patient CA 15-3 assay values should be used in
conjunction with other clinical methods used for monitoring breast cancer.
WARNING: The concentration of CA 15-3 in a given specimen, as determined by assays from
different manufacturers, can vary due to differences in assay methods and reagent specificity.
The results reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the assay for
CA 15-3 used. Values obtained with different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably. If,
in the course of monitoring a patient, the assay method used for determining serial levels of CA
15-3 is changed, the laboratory must perform additional serial testing to confirm baseline values.
Prior to changing assays, the laboratory MUST confirm baseline values for patients being
serially monitored. Lumipulse G CA15-3 should not be used for cancer screening or diagnosis.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Reagents
The Lumipulse G CA15-3 Immunoreaction Cartridges consists of 3 × 14 tests. Each kit contains
the following
1) Antibody-Coated Particle Solution (250 μL/Immunoreaction Cartridge) contains 150
μg/mL anti-CA 15-3 monoclonal antibody (mouse)-coated particles, protein stabilizers
(bovine and mouse) and chemical stabilizers in 0.15 M sodium chloride/Tris buffer. This
solution contains gelatin and turns into gel at 15°C or lower. Preservative: sodium azide.
2) Enzyme-Labeled Antibody Solution (350 μL/Immunoreaction Cartridge) contains 0.2
μg/mL alkaline phosphatase (ALP: calf)-labeled anti-CA 15-3 monoclonal antibody
(mouse), protein stabilizers (bovine and calf) and chemical stabilizers in 0.1 M sodium
chloride/MES buffer. Preservative: sodium azide.
Materials required but provided separately:
1) Lumipulse G CA15-3 Calibrators: Calibrator 1 and Calibrator 2
K192524 - Page 2 of 17

2) LUMIPULSE G Substrate Solution
3) LUMIPULSE G Wash Solution
4) LUMIPULSE G Specimen Diluent 1
5) Sampling tips for LUMIPULSE SYSTEM
6) Soda lime for LUMIPULSE SYSTEM
7) LUMIPULSE G Dilution Cartridges
B Principle of Operation:
CA 15-3 in specimens specifically binds to anti-CA 15-3 monoclonal antibody (mouse) on the
particles, and antigen-antibody immunocomplexes are formed. The particles are then washed and
rinsed to remove unbound materials. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP; calf)-labeled anti-CA 15-3
monoclonal antibody (mouse) specifically binds to CA 15-3 of the immunocomplexes on the
particles and additional immunocomplexes are formed. The particles are washed and rinsed to
remove unbound materials. Substrate Solution is added and mixed with the particles. Adamantyl-
1-2-dioxetane phosphate (AMPPD) contained in the Substrate Solution is dephosphorylated by
the catalysis of ALP indirectly conjugated to particles. Luminescence (at a maximum wavelength
of 477 nm) is generated by the cleavage reaction of dephosphorylated AMPPD. The luminescent
signal reflects the amount of CA 15-3 in specimen.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP05-A3. Six level
panels (at six analyte concentrations) of native serum sample were run in triplicate for the 5-
day studies at three sites using three lots of reagents and in duplicate for the 20-day study.
Tumor Marker Controls (TMC) Level 1 (13.0–24.2 U/mL) and Level 2 (115–214 U/mL)
were run in singlicate and used for validity. For each run, all replicates for each panel were
obtained from the same sample cup. All panels were tested within two hours of being placed
on-board the LUMIPULSE G1200 System.
a) 20-day precision: The studies were performed at a single site and utilized one lot (Lot A)
of Immunoreaction Cartridges (IC) and Calibrators, duplicate per sample per run, two
runs daily over the course of 20 working days (n=80 for each sample). The data were
analyzed for within-run, between-run, between-day, and total precision. The mean U/mL
and percent coefficient of variation (%CV) are summarized in table below.

b) Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility: A 5-day study was performed at a single site using three
different lots (Lot A, B and C) of ICs and Calibrators. Each sample was tested in
triplicate per run, two runs per day for five days. The combined results from each lot, day
and run were used to calculate the repeatability (within-run), between-run, between-day,
between-lot and total precision (n=90 for each sample) and are summarized in table
below.

2. Linearity:
a) Linearity studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI guideline EP6-A. High serum
sample pools were created using patient serum samples that contained naturally
expressed CA 15-3 (450 U/mL). This high CA 15-3 concentration patient serum pool was
diluted at 19 levels of dilution with a low CA 15-3 concentration patient serum sample
pool (0.1 U/mL). The samples were tested in replicates of four and all members of a
sample set were run together. The fitted polynomial and its 95% confidence interval are
shown in figure below.

ii) Dilution Recovery:
A study was completed to assess the automated and manual dilution (1:10 and 1:100)
for the Lumipulse G CA15-3 assay according to CLSI guideline EP34. Panels from
10 apparently healthy normal human serum (NHS) samples within the target
measurement range of the assay (2.0–400.0 U/mL) and 10 high, naturally expressing
CA 15-3 serum sample pools exceeding the target measurement range of the assay
(>400.0 U/mL) were prepared. The panels were tested as neat specimens in duplicate
using the auto-dilution feature of the assay parameter with dilution cartridges at 1:10
and 1:100. In addition, two users each prepared three (3) separate dilutions for each
panel in LUMIPULSE G Specimen Diluent 1 (LPSD1) to capture the variability of
manual dilution preparation. The within-lot, between-run, between-day and between-
instrument %CVs were all ≤ 10%. The calculated percent recovery is summarized in
table below.
% Recovery
Dilution Set Manual Dilution Automated Dilution
1:10 94% to 113% 93% to 112%
1:100 92% to 105% 90% to 102%
c) High Dose Hook Effect:
Hook effect was evaluated using samples prepared by adding an CA 15-3 analyte to one
apparently healthy normal human serum sample to 9,000 U/mL. The sample was serially
diluted with the Low Serum Sample Pool throughout the measuring range of the assay
(1.7 U/mL to 400 U/mL) and tested in triplicate with all members of a sample set run
together. No high dose hook effect was observed when samples up to approximately
9,000 U/mL of CA 15-3 were assayed.

Interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 and EP37 guidelines to
determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the Lumipulse G
CA15-3 assay. Three native human serum pools with a target concentration of 30–35 U/mL,
80–100 U/mL and 300–350 U/mL were supplemented with potentially interfering
compounds, and the percent bias was determined by comparing the result of sample with
interferent to a control sample without the interferent.
a) Endogenous Substance Interference:
The following endogenous substances were tested using Lumipulse G CA15-3 assay. No
significant interference was found for each substance at the concentrations listed below.
Endogenous Interferences Concentration
Free Bilirubin (unconjugated) 60 mg/dL

c) Cross-Reactivity:
Cross-reactivity of the following cancer marker antigens in the Lumipulse G CA15-3
assay was tested—the results are summarized in the following table.
Interferent Highest Observed %
(Antigen) Test Concentration Cross Reactivity
CA19-9 11,000 U/mL 0.003
CA125 11,000 U/mL 0.024
AFP 500 ng/mL -0.063
CEA 5,000 ng/mL 8.246
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The claimed Lumipulse G CA15-3 Analytical Measuring Interval (AMI) is 1.7 to 400.0
U/mL. The device allows auto-dilution of samples—the Extended Measuring Interval (EMI)
(The ULOQ to the maximum dilution concentration) is 400.0 to 40,000 U/mL. The
Reportable Range (the lower limit of the AMI to the maximum dilution concentration) is 1.7
to 40,000 U/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability:
There is no recognized standard for CA 15-3. Calibration of the Lumipulse G CA15-3 is
traceable to in-house reference calibrators, whose values have been assigned to correlate
to Fujirebio Diagnostics’ CA 15-3 Radioimmunoassay.
b) Kit and On-board Stability:
The shelf-life studies for Lumipulse G CA15-3 Immunoreaction Cartridges showed the
cartridges were stable under the following conditions: (i) during transportation when
shipped at 2–10°C; (ii) for shelf-life at 2–10°C for 12 months; (iii) on-board the
LUMIPULSE G System for 30 days.
c) Sample Stability:
The sample stability was performed according to CLSI EP25-A guidelines. The stability
of serum, K EDTA, lithium heparin and sodium heparin plasma samples at 2‒10°C or at
2
-20°C ±10°C was determined to be 14 Days, and up to four freeze/thaw cycles.

6. Detection Limit:
CLSI guideline EP17-A2 were followed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of
Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for Lumipulse G CA15-3.
LoB: Four unique ultra-low CA 15-3 human serum samples (≤ 0.1 U/mL) were obtained by
ultra-filtering with a 100 kDa membrane filter. The samples were tested for three days, two
runs per day, 10 replicates per run, with two reagent lots (N=240). The LoB was calculated
nonparametrically as the upper 95% point of the numerically recorded readings. This gave
the LoB value 0.020 U/mL for Lot-A and 0.022 U/mL for Lot-B.
LoD: The ultra-low samples were combined with seven individual native serum samples with
elevated CA 15-3 concentrations to prepare seven CA 15-3 serum sample panels at the
targeted concentration range of 0.2 to 1.4 U/mL. The samples were tested for three days, two
runs per day, 10 replicates per run, with two reagent lots (N=420). The LoD value was
determined as 0.053 U/mL for Lot-A and 0.037 U/mL for Lot-B.
LoQ: The quantitative detection of a CA 15-3 in the samples (described in LoD above) with
known measurement accuracy was determined as 0.138 U/mL for Lot-A and 0.0617 U/mL
for Lot-B.
The claimed LoB was determined to be 0.022 U/mL, the claimed LoD was determined to be
0.053 U/mL and the claimed LoQ was calculated to be 0.138 U/mL.

See Clinical Cut-off below.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
To compare values of the Lumipulse G CA15-3 and the predicate device and to assert
accuracy by high correlation, 132 human serum samples, obtained from commercial vendors,
were tested. The Lumipulse G CA15-3 measuring range (1.7–400.0 U/mL) was different
from that of the predicate ARCHITECT CA 15-3 (0.5 – 800.0 U/mL). The samples tested
ranged from 5.3 to 375.6 U/mL for Lumipulse G CA15-3 and 5.1 to 1004.4 U/mL for
ARCHITECT CA15-3.

and the predicate device. Sample testing with Lumipulse G CA15-3 was performed on three
LUMIPULSE G1200 Systems (on three sites) utilizing one lot of Immunoreaction
Cartridges, two lots of Calibrators and one calibration curve at each site. Sample testing with
predicate ARCHITECT CA15-3 was performed on one ARCHITECT i2000SR System
utilizing one calibration curve, one lot of reagents and one lot of calibrators. The linear
regression analysis obtained from Weighted Deming regression method comparing the
performance of Lumipulse G CA15-3 to the ARCHITECT CA15-3 test results is shown

C Clinical Studies:
The effectiveness of Lumipulse G CA15-3 as an aid in monitoring recurrence or progressive
disease in patients with breast cancer who have detectable levels of CA 15-3 at some point in
their disease process was determined by assessing changes in CA 15-3 levels in retrospectively
collected serial serum samples from 112 patients compared to changes in disease status. The
clinical information collected for each subject included age, gender, race, ethnicity, date of
cancer diagnosis, histology, grade of diagnosis and stage of diagnosis. Samples were selected for
age (range 33 years old to 92 years old; mean age 58 years), ethnicity and stage of disease (stage
I through IV). The staging of the patients was done according to American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition. Changes in CA 15-3 concentrations and in disease status were

analyzed on a per visit basis. Patients were categorized as ‘no evidence of disease’ (NED), stable
disease, progressive disease, responsive disease or recurrent disease by the attending physician
based on the clinical information (imaging, physical examination, and other clinical
investigations). A total of 566 pairs of observations was undertaken with an average number of
6.1 observations per patient. A positive change in CA 15-3 was defined as an increase in the
value that was at least 21% greater than the previous value of the test. Twenty-five percent
(25%) (14/57) of the patient samples with a positive change correlated with the disease
progression, indicating a change in CA 15-3 value of <21% is associated with decreased
likelihood of progression. The results are summarized below.
Primary Progression Performance: The primary analysis was of patients with Stage II (51
patients) and Stage III (19 patients) disease at diagnosis. The visits were classified by whether or
not patients showed progression or recurrent disease, and whether or not the ‘level of change’
exceeded cut-off. No progression included NED, stable disease and responsive disease.

Lower prevalence of progression events was observed during the course of this study in all
stages of disease, demonstrating similar test performance throughout the testing. This can be
primarily explained by significant improvement in breast cancer treatment. Based on this
information, an interpretation of results section will be added to the labeling according to the
table below.
Change in CA 15-3 Value and associated interpretation for Stage II and Stage III patients:
Change in CA 15-3 Interpretation
Concentration (Likelihood of progression)
<21% approximately 4%
≥21% approximately 25%
Based on the results observed in this study, the likelihood of having progression when a positive
result is present (change in CA 15-3 value ≥21%) is approximately 25%, while the likelihood of
progression when a change in CA 15-3 value <21% is approximately 4%. However, the
likelihood of having progression when a positive result is present (a change in CA 15-3 value
≥21%) is only 25%, indicating that 75% of women with CA 15-3 value change ≥21% do not
have progression.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
A positive change in CA 15-3 was defined as an increase in the value that was at least 21%
greater than the previous value of the test for the same patient. This level of change considers the
maximum imprecision of the assay within the reportable range, the intra-individual biological
variation, and the 95% interval (z value for p<0.05). The percent change was derived by
considering the published biological variation; within-subject biological variation (6.2%) was
obtained from the literature.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Serum specimens obtained from apparently healthy males (22 years old to 67 years old) and
females (22 years old to 93 years old) were tested using Lumipulse G CA15-3 per CLSI EP28-
