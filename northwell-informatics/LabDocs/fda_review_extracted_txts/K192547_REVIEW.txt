IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
MAGLUMI 2000 HCG/β-HCG assay kit consists of the following:
Magnetic microbeads coated with anti-hCG monoclonal antibody, containing bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and sodium azide.
Buffer containing BSA and sodium azide for sample dilution.
Anti-hCG monoclonal antibody labeled with N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol (ABEI),
containing BSA and sodium azide.
Calibrator Low- HCG antigen, containing BSA and sodium azide.
Calibrator High- HCG antigen, containing BSA and sodium azide.
Control 1- hCG antigen, containing BSA and sodium azide.
Control 2- hCG antigen, containing BSA and sodium azide.
B Principle of Operation:
The MAGLUMI 2000 HCG/β-HCG assay is an immunoassay run on the MAGLUMI 2000
Immunoassay Analyzer (cleared under k162698). The assay methodology is a sandwich
chemiluminescence immunoassay. The sample is mixed with magnetic microbeads coated with
anti-hCG monoclonal antibody, and then incubated at 37°C. The microbead bound
immunocomplex is washed to separate the unbound phase. Labeled anti-hCG monoclonal

antibody is added to form a sandwich complexes. A second wash step is conducted, and
followed by addition of a reagent to initiate the chemiluminescent reaction. The light signal is
measured by a photomultiplier tube and is proportional to the concentration of total β-hCG
(intact hCG and free β-hCG) present in the sample.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the MAGLUMI 2000 HCG/β-HCG was established in a
reproducibility study. In the study, 2 controls, 2 calibrators, and 6 native patient sample
pools were assayed in replicates of 2 per run, with 2 runs per day for 20 days on each of three
MAGLUMI 2000 Immunoassay Analyzers; for a total of 240 measurements. Each
instrument used a different reagent lot. Three different operators performed tests on each of
the instruments for a total of 9 operators. The results are summarized as follows:

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP6-A.
Low range linearity was established by assaying 11 samples of varying concentration (0.33 to
280 mIU/mL) that were each prepared by a dilution scheme of mixing known volumes of
reference material (WHO 5th International Standard) and hCG free serum.

High range linearity was established by assaying 10 samples of varying concentration (260 to
4680 mIU/mL) that were each prepared by a dilution scheme of mixing known volumes of
reference material (WHO 5th International Standard) and hCG free serum.
Each sample was measured in replicates of 4 using three instruments and three reagents lots.
The recovery at each concentration was calculated relative to the expected concentration
based on the dilution. All recoveries ranged from 90.1% to 109%. A regression analysis was
conducted with the following linear regression lines supporting the claimed analytical
measurement range of 1.13 - 4680 mIU/mL.
High Dose Hook Effect
A high dose hook effect study was conducted to assess the highest hCG concentration along
the dose response curve where the reported results are not impacted by conditions of antigen
excess. In the study, six samples with total β-hCG concentrations from 5,000 to 1,000,000
mIU/mL were prepared by spiking reference material (WHO 5th International Standard) into
hCG free serum. Each sample was measured in duplicates across each of 3 lots. The study
found no evidence of a high dose hook effect for total β-hCG concentrations up to 1,000,000
mIU/mL.
Dilution study
A dilution study was conducted to establish a range in hCG concentrations which are
accurately reported following dilution. The product labeling identifies that samples with
hCG concentrations above the measuring range can be diluted either automatically by the
analyzer or manually using diluent (buffer containing BSA and sodium azide from the kit)
and the recommended dilution is 1:50. After dilution by the analyzer, the analyzer software
automatically takes the dilution into account when reporting the hCG concentration. In the
study, 12 serum samples were prepared by spiking reference material (WHO 5th International
Standard) into hCG free serum and covering an hCG concentration from 4475 mIU/mL to
223,750 mIU/mL. Each of the 12 sample was individually diluted (manually and automated)
samples 5 times and then assayed using 3 reagent lots on 3 instruments in two replicates for
each lot and instrument. The results demonstrated that all individual dilution recoveries for
both manual and automated dilution were between 90.0% and 110.0%.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity performance of the MAGLUMI 2000 HCG/β-HCG assay was
established by conducting interference testing. Interference from potentially cross reacting
substances, certain exogenous and endogenous substances were assessed using serum
samples spiked to three total hCG concentrations of 6.0, 100, and 2000 mIU/mL. Each
sample was divided into two aliquots: test (with added interferent) and control (with no
added interferent), and measured in triplicates across each of 3 lots. Bias in the results was
analyzed by comparing the test sample quantitation to the control. The sponsor defined no
significant interference as a bias within ± 10%. The following table lists the concentration of
each substance at which no significant interference was found in the study.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The MAGLUMI 2000 HCG/β-HCG method has been standardized against WHO 5th
International Standard 07/364.
6. Detection Limit:
The detection limit of the MAGLUMI 2000 HCG/β-HCG was established by evaluation of
the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ).
LoB
The LoB was estimated following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2 and derived from
the 95th percentile from non-parametric distribution of replicate measurements of a blank
sample. In the study, a blank sample comprised of hCG negative serum was measured using
3 reagent lots and one instrument. For each lot, the sample was measured in replicates of 16

per run over 5 days for a total of 80 measurements per lot. The higher of the three LoB values
from each lot is taken as the LoB concentration; 0.30 mIU/mL.
LoD
The LoD was estimated following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2. In the study four
low concentration samples (0.5 mIU/mL to 1.6 mIU/mL) were prepared near the expected
LoD by spiking reference material (WHO 5th International Standard) into hCG free serum.
Each of the four samples was measured using three reagents lots. For each lot, the samples
were measured in replicates of 16 per run over 5 days using one instruments for a total of 80
measurements per lot. The higher of the three LoD values from each lot is taken as the LoD
concentration; 0.47 mIU/mL.
LoQ
The LoQ was estimated following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2. In the study six
low concentration samples (0.5 mIU/mL to 5.0 mIU/mL) were prepared near the expected
LoQ by spiking reference material (WHO 5th International Standard) into hCG free serum.
Each of the six samples was measured using three reagents lots. For each lot, the samples
were measured in replicates of 6 per run over 5 days using one instruments for a total of 30
measurements per lot. The LOQ of each reagent lot was derived as the lowest concentration
of which percent bias is less than 15% and CV% is less than 20%. The higher of the three
LoQ values from each lot was taken as the LoQ; 1.13 mIU/mL.
The results of the detection limit studies are summarized as follows:
