III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
ETEST is a manual, quantitative technique for determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of
non-fastidious Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobic bacteria and fastidious bacteria. The
system comprises a predefined antibiotic gradient which is used to determine the Minimum
Inhibitory Concentration (MIC, in μg/mL) of different antimicrobial agents against
microorganisms tested on agar media after overnight incubation.
Delafloxacin has been shown to be active against the aerobic microorganisms listed below
according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial agent.
ETEST DFX can be used to determine the MIC of Delafloxacin against the following
microorganisms:
Active both in vitro and in clinical infections:
Gram-positive bacteria:
Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible strains)
Staphylococcus haemolyticus
Staphylococcus lugdunensis
Enterococcus faecalis
Gram-negative bacteria:
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Manual reading only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ETEST gradient technology is based on a combination of the concepts of dilution and
diffusion principles for susceptibility testing.
The ETEST consists of a thin, inert, nonporous plastic strip that is used to determine the
antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria. One side of the strip has the minimum inhibitory
K192738 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
concentration (MIC) reading scale expressed in μg/mL. The other side of the strip contains a
predefined continuous exponential gradient of antibiotic concentrations.
When the strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacterial growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip appears.
The MIC value is read from the scale in terms of μg/mL at complete inhibition of bacterial
growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip.
ETEST Delafloxacin contains a range of delafloxacin from 0.002 to 32 μg/mL.
B Principle of Operation:
When the ETEST strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacteria growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip appears.
After incubation, the MIC value is read from the scale in terms of μg/mL at complete inhibition
of bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip. Since ETEST
generates MIC values which fall between two-fold dilutions for interpretation, the MIC value
read must be recorded to the next two-fold dilution.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Inoculum Density Check. Inoculum density checks were performed for all quality control
and for 10% of the suspensions prepared for susceptibility testing of the contemporary
clinical isolates. Inoculum density checks were also performed on reproducibility organism
suspensions.
The overall mean inoculum densities in colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) for
isolates tested with the reference method ranged from 4.33 x 105 to 5.65 x 105 CFU/mL. The
overall mean inoculum densities for isolates tested with the ETEST ranged from 8.66 x 107 to
1.51 x 108 CFU/mL.
The inoculum densities were acceptable.
Purity Check. Verification of isolate purity was conducted on all clinical, challenge and
quality control organism suspensions for each ETEST inoculum and from each growth
control well of the broth microdilution (BMD) reference panel.
Growth or Device Failure. Growth was observed for all organisms and no device failures
occurred in the ETEST Delafloxacin clinical trial.
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI recommended QC strains (Enterococcus faecalis ATCC
29212, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213)
were tested at least 20 times per site at four sites using both ETEST and BMD reference
methods. The results are summarized in Table 1.

B. Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Results obtained with ETEST Delafloxacin were compared to results obtained with the CLSI
broth microdilution (BMD) reference panel. The reference panel, prepared and interpreted
according to recommendations outlined in the CLSI M07 11th ed., contained two-fold serial
dilutions of delafloxacin with a concentration range of 0.002 – 32 μg/mL. At the end of
incubation, the MIC value obtained from the ETEST (where the complete inhibition of
growth intersects the strip) was compared to MIC results obtained with the reference method.
The testing conditions for ETEST consisted of the following:
• Inoculum: Direct colony suspension to achieve a suspension equivalent to a
0.5 McFarland standard suspension
• Medium: Cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth or agar
• Incubation: 35° C ± 2 for 16-20 hours
Clinical testing for ETEST Delafloxacin was evaluated at three external sites (two located
within the United States and one located outside the United States). Each clinical isolate was
tested one time by ETEST and BMD using the same initial standardized inoculum prepared
in 0.85% saline. A total of 538 clinical isolates were tested which included 120 E. faecalis,

ETEST Delafloxacin performance for each organism group was acceptable with both
essential agreement and categorical agreement >90% and zero major or very major errors.
According to the FDA drug label, delafloxacin is active both in vitro and in clinical
infections against S. lugdunensis. At the time of testing, breakpoints for delafloxacin and S.
lugdunensis had not been established; therefore, categorical agreement could not be
determined. The following statement is included in the device labeling as a footnote to the
performance table:
Category Agreement is not calculated because Delafloxacin breakpoints for S.
lugdunensis were not established by the FDA.
To address testing and reporting of non-indicated species, the following statement is included
in the Warnings and Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.

Inoculator and ETEST Strip Applicator Options
Culture media plates for ETEST can be inoculated and streaked by swabs manually or with
the RETRO C80 inoculator. ETEST strips can be applied onto inoculated media using
forceps or the NEMA C88 vacuum pen.
The ETEST Delafloxacin studies used both inoculation and strip application methods. The
following statement is included as a footnote to the performance table in the device labeling:
The optional inoculator and ETEST strip applicator can be used for plate inoculation
and applying ETEST strips onto agar media. In the ETEST Delafloxacin clinical studies,
swabs and the Inoculator RETRO C80 were used for plate inoculation/streaking and
forceps and the Vacuum Pen NEMA C88 were used for ETEST strip application.
Trending
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) for each
organism species and group. This trending calculation analyzes device MIC values that are
determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher than the reference method.
MIC values that are off-scale for both the reference and device are not considered in the
trending analysis.
Trending results were stratified by species to determine if species-related trends were
observed (Table 4). Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with
higher versus lower MIC values was ≥30% and for which the confidence interval was
determined to be statistically significant were considered to have evidence of trending and is
addressed in labeling.

As noted above, a trend toward higher MIC values was observed with S. aureus and E.
faecalis. The following statement is included as a footnote to the performance table in the
device labeling:
ETEST Delafloxacin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one doubling
dilution higher when testing Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis compared
to the CLSI reference broth microdilution method.

Resistance Markers
Resistance markers for clinical isolates were identified by whole genome sequencing
analysis. They consisted of genetic markers that encode β-lactam resistance (mecA, mecC,
pdc, oxa, veb, lcr-nps), mutations in defined regions of targeted bacterial enzymes that
promote quinolone resistance (MexR, MexT, MexS, GyrA, ParC, ParE) or genetic markers
that encode glycopeptides (vanB).

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the ETEST Delafloxacin when revised breakpoints for delafloxacin are
published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the
submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the delafloxacin
device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-
evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new
limitations as determined by their evaluation.
