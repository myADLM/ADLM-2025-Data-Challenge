III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The ADVIA Centaur CA 15-3 assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative serial
determination of cancer antigen CA 15-3 in human serum and plasma (EDTA and lithium
heparin) using the ADVIA Centaur, ADVIA Centaur XP, and ADVIA Centaur XPT systems.
When used in conjunction with other clinical and diagnostic procedures, serial testing with the
ADVIA Centaur CA 15-3 assay is useful for monitoring the course of disease and therapy in
metastatic breast cancer patients, and for detection of recurrence in previously treated Stage II,
with greater than two positive lymph nodes, or Stage III breast cancer patients. This assay is not
intended for use on any other system.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

D Special Instrument Requirements:
ADVIA Centaur, ADVIA Centaur XP, and ADVIA Centaur XPT
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The device contains the following materials:
• 1 or 5 ReadyPack primary reagent packs for 100 or 500 tests
• ADVIA Centaur CA 15-3 Master Curve card
The ReadyPack for ADVIA Centaur CA 15-3 consists of the following:
• Lite Reagent: 5.0 mL monoclonal mouse anti-DF3 antibody labeled with acridinium
ester in buffered saline with bovine serum albumin (BSA), sodium azide (< 0.1%), and
preservatives.
• Solid Phase Reagent: 25.0 mL monoclonal mouse capture antibody covalently coupled

B Principle of Operation:
The ADVIA Centaur CA 15-3 assay is a fully automated, two-step sandwich immunoassay using
direct chemiluminescent technology. The Lite Reagent is composed of the monoclonal mouse
antibody, DF3, specific for CA 15-3, labeled with acridinium ester. The Conjugate Reagent is
composed of the monoclonal mouse antibody 115D8, specific for CA15-3, labeled with
fluorescein. The Solid Phase is composed of purified monoclonal mouse capture antibody,
which is covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles. The sample is incubated with both
Conjugate Reagent and Solid Phase simultaneously for 20 minutes. After incubation, the
immuno-complex is washed and the Lite Reagent is added, incubated for an additional 20
minutes and then washed again.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical specificity/interference were demonstrated in K012357
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The claimed measuring range is from 3.0 U/mL to 200 U/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The traceability and stability were established in K012357.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the
ADVIA Centaur CA 15-3 were determined according to the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
LoB was determined by testing six analyte free samples in replicates of five per run, two run
per day, for six days on one ADVIA Centaur XP system using two lots of reagents. The LoB
was estimated as the 95th percentile of 360 measurements for each of the lots tested and
determined to be 0.62 U/mL and 0.82 U/mL for the two lots. The claimed LoB is 1.0 U/mL
LoD was determined using 10 serum samples with low CA15-3 concentrations. Each sample
was tested in five replicates per run, two runs per day, for six days on one ADVIA Centaur
XP system using two lots of reagents. The LoD was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of
the replicates for the low-level samples and determined as 0.96 mg/L and 1.03 U/mL for the
two lots. The claimed LoD is 2.0 U/mL.
LoQ was determined using a set of 10 serum samples. Each sample was tested in five
replicates per run, two runs per day, for six days with two reagent lots on one ADVIA
Centaur XP system for a total of 60 data points per sample per reagent lot. The LoQ is
defined as the mean value of the sample which fulfills the specification for the total within-
laboratory imprecision ≤ 20% CV. The results supports that the claimed LoQ is 3.0 U/mL
which is the lower limit of the measuring range claimed for the assay.

To demonstrate that Li-Heparin plasma and K2-EDTA plasma samples yield results
comparable with serum samples by the ADVIA Centaur CA 15-3 assay, a study was
performed by using 129 serum/K2-EDTA plasma paired samples and 108 serum/Li-heparin
plasma paired samples. Paired samples were each tested in singleton with one reagent lot on
one ADVIA Centaur XP system. The Demining regression analysis was performed, and the
results are summarized in the following table:
Range Slope Intercept
N Correlation
(U/mL) (95% CI) (95% CI)
Serum vs. 0.96 0.46
129 3.43–199.49 1.00
K2-EDTA (0.93, 0.99) (0.01, 0.91)
Serum vs. 1.02 -0.72
108 3.13–196.11 1.00
Li-heparin (1.00, 1.05) (-1.44, -0.01)
The data support the addition of K2-EDTA plasma and Li-heparin plasma sample types to
the ADVIA Centaur CA 15-3 assay.
