III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indication(s) for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
For in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of cortisol in serum, plasma (EDTA
and lithium heparin), and urine using the ADVIA Centaur XP system. Measurements of cortisol
are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the adrenal gland.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Prescription use only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
ADVIA Centaur XP
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ADVIA Centaur Cortisol (COR) assay is a competitive immunoassay using direct
chemiluminescent technology. Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated
specifically on each instrument by a 2-point calibration and a master curve with the reagent bar
code.
The ADVIA Centaur COR reagent kit contains the following:
ADVIA Centaur ReadyPack® primary reagent pack contains Lite Reagent and Solid Phase
Reagent. Lite reagent consists of 2.5 mL reagent pack with cortisol labeled with acridinium ester
in buffered saline with sodium salicylate (~50 mg/mL), sodium azide (0.1%) and preservatives.
Solid phase reagent consists of 12.5 mL reagent pack with rabbit anti-cortisol antibody (~1.1
μg/mL) bound to monoclonal mouse anti-rabbit IgG antibody (~56 μg/mL) covalently coupled to
paramagnetic particles in buffered saline with sodium azide (0.1%) and preservatives.
B Principle of Operation:
The ADVIA Centaur Cortisol (COR) assay is a competitive immunoassay using direct
chemiluminescent technology. Cortisol in the patient sample competes with acridinium ester
labeled cortisol in the Lite Reagent for binding to polyclonal rabbit anti-cortisol antibody in the
Solid Phase. The polyclonal rabbit anti-cortisol antibody is bound to monoclonal mouse anti-
rabbit antibody, which is covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in the Solid Phase. An
inverse relationship exists between the amount of cortisol present in the patient sample and the
amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the instrument.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Previously established in k142723.
2. Linearity:
Previously established in k142723.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference testing was conducted according to CLSI EP07-ed3: Interference Testing in
Clinical Chemistry. Interfering substances were tested using human K2-EDTA and heparin
pools. Various concentration of interferents were spiked into one pool at low and one at high
cortisol concentrations for each matrix. The same sample pools with no interferents were
used as controls. All samples were run in triplicate using ADVIA Centaur XP instrument and
one reagent lot. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as ≤10% difference
between the spiked samples and control. Results are summarized below.
Potential Interferent Highest concentration tested
that showed no interference
K2-EDTA 9.0 mg/mL
Lithium heparin 75 U/mL

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed to demonstrate sample equivalence between
serum and plasma (K2-EDTA and lithium heparin). Matched sample sets were tested using
one ADVIA Centaur (COR) assay reagent lot and one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument. One
replicate was tested for each sample. A total of 83 dipotassium EDTA plasma/serum and 99
lithium heparin plasma/serum sample pairs were tested. Deming linear regression analysis
was used to analyze measured values using serum as the comparator. The results are shown
in the table below.
