Procalcitonin (PCT)
C Type of Test:
Quantitative, Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of PCT (procalcitonin) in human serum and
plasma (K2 –EDTA, K3-EDTA and Li-Heparin).
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on cobas e immunoassay
analyzers.
Used in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments, Elecsys BRAHMS PCT is
intended for use as follows:
• to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for
progression to severe sepsis and septic shock,
• to determine the change in PCT level over time as an aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk
of all-cause mortality for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when
obtained in the emergency department or other medical wards prior to ICU admission,
• to aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy, for inpatients or patients in the emergency
department with suspected or confirmed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) – defined as
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute bronchitis, and acute exacerbation of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD),
• to aid in decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for patients with suspected or confirmed
sepsis.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Warnings and Precautions
The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT is not indicated to be used as a stand-alone diagnostic assay and should be
used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms of infection and other diagnostic evidence. In cases
where the laboratory results do not agree with the clinical picture or history, additional tests should be
K192815 - Page 2 of 20

--- Page 3 ---
performed. Changes in PCT should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical status of the
patient and other laboratory results. Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely
on procalcitonin concentrations.
There is no uniformly recognized interpretation of the change in PCT concentration levels for the
prediction of mortality, and overall mortality is strongly dependent on many factors, including pre-
existing patient risk factors and clinical course. The need to continue ICU care at Day 4 and other
covariates (e.g., age, SOFA score) are also significant predictors of 28 day cumulative mortality risk.
Validation of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT test as an aid in predicting mortality was performed in a study
population with an overall 28 day mortality of 22 %.
Certain patient characteristics, such as severity of renal failure or insufficiency, may influence
procalcitonin values and should be considered as potentially confounding clinical factors when
interpreting PCT values. Increased PCT levels may be observed in severe illness such as polytrauma,
burns, major surgery, prolonged or cardiogenic shock. PCT levels may not be elevated in patients
infected by certain atypical pathogens, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
The safety and performance of PCT-guided therapy for individuals younger than age 17 years, pregnant
women, immunocompromised individuals or those on immunomodulatory agents, was not formally
analyzed in the supportive clinical trials.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The submission demonstrates performance on the cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay is intended for use with the cobas e immunoassay analyzers, PCT
Cal1 and Cal2 reagents, and the PreciControl PCT1 and PCT2 as part of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT Kit.
An optional Procalcitonin CalCheck product is also available.
B Principle of Operation:
The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles,
biotinylated antibody and antibody labeled with ruthenium as well as an electrochemiluminescence
detection system. Procalcitonin (PCT) in the sample reacts with these labeled antibodies to form a
sandwich complex. This complex binds to streptavidin coated magnetic microparticles, which are
magnetically captured onto an electrode. Application of voltage to the electrode induces
chemiluminescence which is measured by a photomultiplier tube. Results are determined via a calibration
curve which is instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via
the reagent barcode.
Total duration of assay: 18 minutes.
K192815 - Page 3 of 20

--- Page 4 ---
• 1st incubation: Antigen in the sample (30 μL), a biotinylated monoclonal PCT-specific antibody,
and a monoclonal PCT-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex*) react to form a
sandwich complex.
• 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex becomes bound
to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
• The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed
with ProCell M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent
emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
• Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically generated by 2-
point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.
(*):Tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II)-complex (Ru(bpy)₃²⁺)
C Reagents
The reagent working solutions include:
Rackpack (kit placed on analyzer)
• M: Streptavidin-coated microparticles,
• R1: Anti-PCT-Ab~biotin
• R2: Anti-PCT-Ab~Ru(bpy)₃²⁺
The following change is proposed to block the interference of biotin with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT
assay: Roche is taking a one-step approach by adding an antibody to bind free biotin in the sample. For
the neutralization of free biotin in serum and plasma, Roche developed an antibody which binds to free
biotin. The antibodies are specific for free biotin and do not bind to, or interact with, the biotin-linker
conjugates.

Endogenous Interferences
The effect on quantitation of PCT in the presence of five endogenous interfering substances
(Hemoglobin, Biotin, Intralipid, Bilirubin, and Rheumatoid Factor) was tested using one cobas e 601
analyzer at clinically relevant concentrations. One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the
interfering substance, another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of the respective solvent
(dilution pool). The interfering pool was then incrementally diluted into the dilution pool. The
recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the analyte concentration of the respective
dilution pools.
The following substances evaluated with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay were found not to affect
the test performance at concentrations reasonably and consistently found in clinical situations.

Exogenous Interference
Thirty-four pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into human serum sample pools at clinically
relevant PCT concentrations (0.10 ng/mL, 0.25 ng/mL, 0.5 ng/mL and 2.0 ng/mL) and tested with the
Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay on the cobas e 604 analyzer.
The following substances evaluated with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay were found not to affect
the test performance at concentrations reasonably and consistently found in clinical situations.

Sample Stability
Please refer to previously FDA-cleared 510(k) K160729 and K173927 for Sample Stability Effect
performance. No additional testing was conducted.
Reagent On-Board Stability
A fresh Elecsys BRAHMS PCT test kit was placed on the cobas e 601 analyzer and calibrated.
Reference values for the samples tested were determined (day 0). After 8, 15, 22 and 29 days (1, 2, 3
and 4 weeks) the same samples were measured with the same reagent kit kept under on- board
condition. Re-calibration was performed at every measuring time point.
Samples tested include eight (8) human serum (HS) sample pools. Each sample was tested in two-
fold determination. Samples were targeted with values near medical decision levels of 0.1 ng/mL,
0.25 ng/mL, 0.5 ng/mL and 2.0 ng/mL as one sample range, along with sample ranges at low,
medium and high PCT concentration ranges relative to the measuring range. Mean recovery values
for each sample range were calculated. Elecsys BRAHMS PCT reagent kits can be kept on board of
the instruments for up to 4 weeks (28 days). A new calibration of the kit kept on board is
recommended every 7 days.

Calibration Stability
The Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was calibrated with a fresh reagent kit on Day 0 using one cobas e
601 analyzer. After 3, 6, and 9 weeks a new reagent kit of the same lot was used with recovery of
samples being determined using the calibration curve established on Day 0 for that reagent kit lot.
Fourteen (14) human serum samples were tested in duplicate. Recovery compared to the reference
value was calculated as absolute deviation in ng/mL or relative deviation in %. Samples were targeted
with values near medical decision levels of 0.1 ng/mL, 0.25 ng/mL, 0.5 ng/mL and 2.0 ng/mL along
with samples spread across the measuring range. Mean recovery values for each sample range were
calculated. The resulting data support the package-insert claim of 8 weeks lot calibration stability
when using the same reagent kit lot.
7. Detection Limit:
Limit of Detection
Please refer to previously FDA-cleared 510(k) K160729 and K173927 for Limit of Detection
performance. No additional testing was conducted.
Limit of Quantitation
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay was determined according to
CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ represents the lowest amount of analyte that can be quantitatively
determined with stated accuracy, precision, and experimental conditions. The LoQ was calculated
based on intermediate precision according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ was determined as the lowest
concentration of analyte that can be quantified with an intermediate precision of no more than 20%.
A five-day LoQ experiment was carried out with one reagent lot on one cobas e 601 analyzer.
Samples tested included seven native human serum (HS) samples and were measured in five-fold
determination for each run. A total of 150 measuring points were collected.
The mean values and the intermediate precision (coefficient of variation and standard deviation) for
each LoQ sample were calculated. To determine the LoQ, samples were sorted according to the
concentration of their measured mean value. The LoQ is defined as the mean value of the sample that
is first to fulfill the specification for intermediate precision, and for which there is no lower-
concentration sample that exceeds the specification. The LoQ data are represented in the table below.

8. Assay Cut-Off:
28-day mortality:
• ΔPCT ≤ 80%
A decrease in the PCT levels below or equal to 80% defines a positive ΔPCT test result
representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with
severe sepsis or septic shock.
• ΔPCT > 80%
A decrease in the PCT levels of more than 80% defines a negative ΔPCT test result
representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with
severe sepsis or septic shock.
NOTE: The combination of the first PCT level (≤ 2.0 ng/mL or > 2.0 ng/mL) at initial diagnosis
of severe sepsis or septic shock with the patient’s clinical course and the change in PCT level
over time until Day 4 provides important additional information about the mortality risk.

Progression Risk:
• PCT > 2 μg/L
A PCT level above 2.0 μg/L on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a high risk
for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
• PCT < 0.5 μg/L
A PCT level below 0.5 μg/L on the first day of ICU admission is associated with a low risk
for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
LRTI Antibiotic Decision Making:
• PCT < 0.10 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy strongly discouraged.
• PCT 0.10-0.25 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy discouraged.
• PCT 0.26-0.50 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy encouraged.
• PCT >0.50 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy strongly encouraged.
Sepsis Antibiotic Discontinuation:
• ΔPCT > 80%
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued
• PCT ≤ 0.50 ng/mL
Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued
Recommendations for Laboratory Reports for Initiation and Discontinuation:
The Change in Procalcitonin Calculator is available at http://www.brahms-pct-calculator.com.
The Change in Procalcitonin Calculator can be used to determine ΔPCT results. It is suggested to
report the numerical PCT values (individual or paired). For paired PCT values the report should
also indicate if the ΔPCT(%) was ≤ 80% or > 80%. The laboratory report should include a
reference or a link to the package insert for a guided interpretation of the test results.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison of the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay and the predicate was performed using 496
native serum human clinical samples. A concordance analysis was performed with the predicate
device. Only samples in which the result from the candidate and the predicate device were within the
measuring range were included in the concordance analysis. The clinical concordance analysis of the
Elecsys BRAHMS PCT clinical performance study shows more than 96% total agreement between the
Elecsys BRAHMS PCT and the predicate device at the medical decision points 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 2.0
K192815 - Page 16 of 20

ng/mL. The regression slopes are within +/- 10% of identity in Passing-Bablok and Weighted Deming
Analysis. This demonstrates equivalence to the predicate device to include all currently cleared claims
of the predicate device in the labeling of the candidate device.
Further clinical performance study data can be found referenced in K173927 and K160729.

2. Matrix Comparison:
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the Elecsys BRAHMS
PCT immunoassay was determined by comparing values obtained from samples (native human serum
samples, single donors as well as pools) drawn into serum and Li-Heparin, K2-EDTA, K3-EDTA
plasma tubes. A minimum of 40 serum/plasma pairs per sample material were tested in singleton with
one reagent lot on one cobas e 601 analyzer. Data were evaluated using a regression analysis
according to Passing/Bablok.
The results are acceptable and supports the following package-insert claim:
• SST is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys PCT assay
• Li-Heparin plasma is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay
• K2-EDTA plasma is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.
• K3-EDTA plasma is an acceptable sample type for use with the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay.
C Clinical Studies:
