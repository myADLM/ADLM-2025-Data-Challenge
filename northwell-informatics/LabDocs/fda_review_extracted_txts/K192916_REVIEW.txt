Materials needed but not provided:
NOVA View Automated Fluorescence Microscope cleared by FDA in DEN140039 and
K161258.
B Principle of Operation:
Samples are diluted 1:10 in PBS and incubated with the antigen substrate (dsDNA on glass
microscope slides). After incubation, unbound antibodies are washed off. The substrate is then
incubated with anti-human IgG-FITC conjugate. The conjugate contains a DNA-binding blue
fluorescent dye, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) that is required for NOVA View use. The
blue dye is not visible by traditional fluorescence microscope at the wavelength where FITC
fluorescence is viewed. Unbound reagent is washed off. Stained slides are read by manual
fluorescence microscope or scanned with the NOVA View Automated Fluorescence Microscope.
The resulting digital images are reviewed and interpreted from the computer monitor. dsDNA
positive samples exhibit an apple green fluorescence corresponding to areas of the substrate
where autoantibody has bound.
Manual interpretation: A sample is considered positive if specific kinetoplast staining or
kinetoplast plus nuclear staining is observed to be greater than the negative control.
NOVA View interpretation: When slides are analyzed by NOVA View, digital images of
representative fields of view of the well are captured. These digital images must be reviewed and
interpreted from the computer monitor by a trained operator. At the same time when digital
images are taken, NOVA View measures the FITC light intensity of the cells that are included in
the region. NOVA View reports the measured fluorescence intensity (FI) in units of Light
Intensity Units (LIU). NOVA View provides the trained operator with the acquired digital
images and the following supportive information:
• LIU value
• Negative/positive/indeterminate classification
NOVA View Single Well Titer (SWT): The Single Well Titer (SWT) is a software application that
estimates the endpoint titer (i.e. the highest dilution that produces positive result) for wells with a
positive reaction, based on the obtained LIU.

a) Within-Lab Precision: A study was performed by processing six samples (two negative,
two positive and two borderline samples) with various intensities, in three replicates, in
14 runs (two runs per day) for seven days resulting in 42 data points (N) for each sample.
The slides were read by the three methods described above (Manual, NOVA View and
Digital) and three sets of results were generated, including manual reading results,
NOVA View software interpretation, digital image/monitor reading results.
For both digital images reading and manual reading, grades were within ± one reactivity
grade within one run (within triplicates), and the average grade was no more than one
reactivity grade different between runs. The results are summarized in the table below.

The linearity study was performed by serially diluting three positive samples (one high
positive, one medium positive and one low positive) from 1:10 to 1:5,120. These samples
were assessed with the NOVA Lite DAPI dsDNA Crithidia luciliae Kit and read with the
NOVA View, digital images were interpreted and confirmed. All slides were read with
manual microscopy. Qualitative and semi-quantitative results (using a scale of 0 (negative) to
4 (strong positive)) were captured for the manual and digital reading.

All interferents were spiked into every specimen at three different concentrations in 10%
of total specimen volume, and the resulting samples were assessed in triplicates with the
NOVA Lite DAPI dsDNA Crithidia luciliae Kit. All samples were processed with NOVA
Lite DAPI dsDNA Crithidia luciliae kit and read with NOVA View. Digital images were
interpreted and confirmed. Moreover, all slides were read by the same operator with
manual microscopy.
No interference was detected with the tested substances, up to the maximal
concentrations indicated in tables above.
b) Cross-reactivity:
The specificity of the NOVA Lite DAPI dsDNA Crithidia luciliae kit was verified using
the ANA reference panel obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, USA (12 samples). CDC sample (#1) specific for DNA was positive by NOVA
View, digital and manual reading with an intensity grade of +4. All the remaining
samples tested were negative on NOVA View, digital and manual modes with the
exception of sample #7 being a weak positive (+1) for NOVA View and digital reading
modes.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability: A recognized standard or reference material for anti-dsDNA antibodies is
not available.
b) Kit Stability:
Accelerated stability studies were performed for up to 4 weeks at 37°C ± 3°C. The testing
was performed using positive control, negative control and patient panel on all the
components of NOVA Lite DAPI dsDNA Crithidia luciliae Kit including, slides,
conjugate, negative control, positive control, PBSII and mounting medium. The reactivity
of the kits was calculated for each time point (compared to those obtained with 5 ± 3°C
stored kit). All calculations were performed by comparing results of the kit stored at 5 ±
3°C (control) to those stored at 37 ± 3°C (test) for 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks.

The stability data support 8 weeks shelf-life for the FITC IgG Conjugate with DAPI,
dsDNA Positive and IFA System Negative Control after opening when stored at 2‒8⁰C.
c) Sample Stability:
Three samples, encompassing negative, around the cut-off, and positive samples were
tested in duplicates for up to 21 days while stored at 2-8°C, up to 48 hours while stored at
room temperature, and after repeated freeze/thaw cycles up to 3 cycles. Results were
compared to those obtained on control samples (day zero, stored at 2-8°C).
Based on the results, the stability data support sample storage up to 48 hours at room
temperature, up to 7 days at 2-8°C and up to 3 freeze/thaw cycles (when samples are
stored at or below -20°C).
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The recommended starting dilution, above which the result is reported as positive and below
which the result is reported as negative, is 1:10. The manufacturer suggests performing two-
fold dilutions and recommends that each laboratory establish its own titering protocol.
