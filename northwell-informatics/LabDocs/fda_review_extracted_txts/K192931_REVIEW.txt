III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use
B Indication(s) for Use:
The V8 Nexus Hemoglobin UltraScreen method is designed for the separation of normal
hemoglobins (A, A2, and F) in human blood samples, and for the detection of major
hemoglobins variants (S and C) by using a capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) buffer with the
V8 instrument. The V8 Nexus Hemoglobin UltraScreen test is indicated for use in patients 2
years of age and older. This test is designed for in-vitro diagnostic use only in conjunction with
other laboratory and clinical findings.
The V8 instrument is an automated analyzer which performs a complete hemoglobin profile for
quantitative analysis of the normal hemoglobin fractions A, A2 and F and for the detection of
major hemoglobin variants S and C. The assay is performed on the hemolysate of venous whole
blood collected in tubes containing K2EDTA as the anticoagulant.
The V8 AFSA2 Hemo Control (Cat. No. 1812) is to be used as a quantitative and/or qualitative
control for the Hemoglobin UltraScreen on the V8 Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) System.

K192931 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
Capillary zone electrophoresis is achieved using a microbore, fused silica capillary filled with an
electrolyte medium under high voltage. Separation of the charged analytes is due to differential
migration in an electrical field, whereby the charged particles migrate toward an electrode with
an opposite charge. Using V8 Nexus Hemoglobin UltraScreen kit with capillary zone
electrophoresis method available on the V8 Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) System will separate
the more common variants from the normal A peak. The run positions of variant hemoglobins
can be used to give an initial identification of the variants.

f. 5-Day multi-site reproducibility study using patient samples:
Site-to-site precision of the V8 Nexus Hemoglobin UltraScreen assay was assessed at
three different sites, including one internal laboratory and two external clinical
laboratories. One V8 instrument, one lot of V8 Nexus Hemoglobin UltraScreen reagent
kit (same at all 3 sites) and a single operator per site were utilized. The tests were run for
five days, with two runs per day and each run consisted of four replicates (3 sites x 5 days
x 2 runs/day x 4 replicates per run). Each sample has 120 total determinations per
hemoglobin fraction. Within-run, between-run, between-day, between-site and total
precision were analyzed.
Nine samples of varying level of hemoglobin A, A2, F, S and C were prepared by
controlled proportion mixing to generate hemoglobin percentages for each fraction in the
normal and pathologic range, where applicable.
Overall, reproducibility which includes within-run, between-run, between-day, and
between-site components for all hemoglobin fractions quantitated over the course of the
5-day study met predetermined acceptance criteria.

2. Linearity:
The linearity studies were performed using one V8 Nexus Hemoglobin UltraScreen reagent
kit and one V8 instrument, and venous K2-EDTA samples containing different levels of each
hemoglobin fraction (9 levels for each fraction). The samples were allowed to reach room
temperature prior to testing. Linearity was determined by comparing the assigned
hemoglobin fraction % to the measured fraction % for each sample. The absolute
concentration of hemoglobin fractions A, A2, F, S and C varied by using neat undiluted
sample or sample mixing at specific ratios.
Hemoglobin A is linear from 3.7 – 97.2%.
Hemoglobin A2 is linear from 1.7 – 7.6%.
Hemoglobin F is linear from 1.1 – 68.7%.
Hemoglobin S is linear from 5.8 – 78.8%.
Hemoglobin C is linear from 1.4 – 42.6%.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Lipids, conjugated bilirubin, and unconjugated bilirubin interference
Interference studies were conducted using venous K EDTA whole blood samples that
2
included five Hb A levels, four Hb A2 levels (two normal and two elevated), two Hb F
levels, one Hb S level, and one Hb C level. Lipids, unconjugated bilirubin, and conjugated
bilirubin were analyzed for interfering with hemoglobin quantitation. Lipids were tested at 0–
25 g/L. Unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin were tested at 0–25 mg/dL. The
concentrations for bilirubin were 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg/dL and for lipids were 0, 5, 10,
15, 20, and 25 g/L. Each hemoglobin fraction level was analyzed four times (four replicates)
per interferent level. Unconjugated bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, and lipids were found not
to affect test performance at concentrations up to 25 mg/dL and 25 g/L, respectively.
Interferent Maximum Concentration

K2-EDTA interference
An interference study was conducted to assess the interference of K EDTA with respect to
2
hemoglobin quantitation. The study used fresh venous K EDTA whole blood samples that
2
included three Hb A levels, three Hb A2 levels (1 normal and 2 elevated), and one level of
Hb S and Hb C, respectively. K EDTA was tested at 3.6 mg/mL (normal) and 7.2 mg/mL
2
(elevated). No interference by K EDTA was observed at concentration up to 7.2 mg/mL

4. Assay Reportable Range:
For each hemoglobin fraction, the reportable range of the V8 Nexus Hemoglobin UltraScreen
procedure performed using the V8 Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) instrument is summarized
below:
Fraction Reportable Range
Hb A 3.7 – 97.2%
Hb A2 1.7 – 7.6%
Hb F 1.1 – 68.7%
Hb S 5.8 – 78.8%
Hb C 1.4 – 42.6%
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Reagent Stability using normal and abnormal AA2 controls: Reagent stability study was
conducted using three lots of Hemoglobin UltraScreen reagents, normal AA2 assayed
control, and abnormal AA2 assayed control (controls manufactured by Canterbury
Scientific), with five replicates per control per time point. The study, for reagent stability
stored at room temperature, was conducted over 24 months with intervals at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9,
12, 18 and 24 months. Overall, all data met acceptable criteria, demonstrating that
Hemoglobin UltraScreen reagents are stable for up to 24 months. A reagent stability of
18 months at room temperature (15˚C – 30˚C) was claimed.
b) Open Reagent Stability using AA2 controls: Open reagent stability was assessed using
three lots of the Hemoglobin UltraScreen reagents. One lot each of normal AA2 assayed
control and abnormal AA2 assayed control was analyzed. The controls were
commercially available (manufactured by Canterbury Scientific). Each lot of Hemoglobin
UltraScreen reagent was assayed over a 6-month period at defined time points (0 (T0), 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months). At time zero, the reagents were opened, and assays were performed.
The reagents were sealed and stored at room temperature (15˚C – 30˚C, recommended
storage conditions). The same protocol was employed for each time point. Five replicates
were run per time point for each hemoglobin control used. Overall, all data met
acceptable criteria, demonstrating that opened Hemoglobin UltraScreen reagents are
stable for up to 6 months. An open reagent stability of 5 months at room temperature
(15˚C – 30˚C) was claimed.
c) Reagent Stability using AFSA2 control and Hb C donor sample: Reagent stability was
assessed using three lots of Hemoglobin UltraScreen reagents and a single lot of AFSA2

hemoglobin control. The AFSA2 control contains hemoglobins A, F, S and A2
representing each of the four major intervals of migration. Hemoglobin A represents
migration interval Hb A. Hemoglobin F represents migration interval Hb F. Hemoglobin
S represents migration interval Hb S/D and Hb A2 represents migration interval Hb
A2/C/E. Each lot of Hemoglobin UltraScreen reagent was assayed over a 22-month
period at defined time points (0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 18 and 22 months). At months 18
and 22, a Hb C patient sample was analyzed on the three lots of Hemoglobin UltraScreen
reagent compared to a recently manufactured Hemoglobin UltraScreen lot for comparison
(5 months post manufacture). Five replicates were run per time point for each lot of
Hemoglobin UltraScreen kit used. Overall, all data met acceptable criteria, demonstrating
that Hemoglobin UltraScreen reagents are stable for 22 months. The Hb C sample
quantitation was identical on three lots of Hemoglobin UltraScreen reagents at 18 and 22
months compared to a newly manufactured lot. A reagent stability of 18 months at room
temperature (15˚C – 30˚C) was claimed.
d) AFSA2 Control Shelf Life Stability: AFSA2 hemoglobin control stability was assessed
using three lots of AFSA2 hemoglobin control and one lot of Hemoglobin UltraScreen
reagents. Each lot of AFSA2 hemoglobin control was evaluated over 22 months at
defined time points (0 (T0), 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 18 and 22 months). A new vial of each
control lot was used at each time point. Five replicates were run for each lot at each
defined time point. All data were within acceptable criteria. AFSA2 hemoglobin controls
were demonstrated to be stable for 22 months. A stability of 18 months at refrigerated
temperature (2˚C – 8˚C) was claimed.
e) AFSA2 Control Open Vial Stability: An open-vial stability assessment was performed for
AFSA2 hemoglobin control. Three lots of AFSA2 hemoglobin control and one lot of
Hemoglobin UltraScreen reagents were utilized. Each lot of AFSA2 control was assayed
over 8 days with defined time points (0 (T0), 3, 6, 7, 8 days). All vials of AFSA2
hemoglobin controls were opened at day 0 and three vials assayed per lot. Unused vials
were returned to 2–8 ˚C storage. At each time point, three previously opened vials per lot
were equilibrated to room temperature and assayed. Three replicates from each of three
vials were run per time point for each hemoglobin control lot used. All data were within
acceptable criteria. AFSA2 hemoglobin controls were demonstrated to be stable for 8
days after opening followed by refrigerated storage. An open vial stability of 7 days at
refrigerated temperature (2˚C – 8˚C) was claimed.
6. Detection Limit:
a) Limit of Blank (LoB): LoB was determined using the V8 Nexus Hemoglobin UltraScreen
assay on the V8 Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) System over the course of two days. Two
lots of V8 Nexus Hemoglobin UltraScreen and four blank samples containing no
hemoglobin were used. The LoB was calculated as LoB = mean of blank + 1.645(SD of
blank). In the absence of hemoglobin containing sample, the UltraScreen assay yields no
quantitative hemoglobin signal, and thus LoB = 0.
b) Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of quantitation (LoQ): LoD and LoQ were combined
and were defined by the lower limit of linearity. Since the acceptance criteria for the
lower limits of linearity for each hemoglobin fraction satisfied the requirements for
K192931 - Page 10 of 13

--- Page 11 ---
LoD/LoQ, the lower limit of linearity for each hemoglobin fraction was assigned as the
LoD/LoQ for that fraction.
Fraction LoD/LoQ
Hb A 3.7%
Hb A2 1.7%
Hb F 1.1%
Hb S 5.8%
Hb C 1.4%

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted at three external sites (1 OUS and 2 US sites)
comparing the results from the V8 Nexus Hemoglobin UltraScreen test to that of Sebia’s
Capillarys Hemoglobin(E) Test (K112491). Each site used a different lot of V8 Nexus
Hemoglobin UltraScreen reagent kit (3 in total). Fresh venous K EDTA anticoagulated
2
whole blood samples were used. From a total of 439 patient samples, 320 hemoglobin A, 412
hemoglobin A2, and 175 hemoglobin F quantitation’s were performed. 143 presumptive
hemoglobin S and 33 presumptive hemoglobin C were also performed. A single data point
was collected per device platform. UltraScreen data points were accepted only if the data
points were within the UltraScreen linearity range established for each hemoglobin fraction.
For each hemoglobin fraction, Deming regression, Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-
Altman analysis were performed for Helena V8 Nexus Hemoglobin UltraScreen versus Sebia
Capillarys Hemoglobin(E) Test results. Results for the individual sites as well as all sites
combined are presented below. Overall, method comparison study results satisfied the
predetermined acceptance criteria for every hemoglobin fraction, demonstrating substantial
equivalence between the candidate device and the predicate device.

2. Matrix Comparison:
Matrix studies comparing fresh, refrigerated, and frozen K2-EDTA anticoagulated venous
whole blood samples were conducted to assess the effects of sample matrix on assay results.
Hb A samples (normal and decreased due to phenotype), Hb A2 samples (normal and
elevated), one Hb S sample (elevated), one Hb C samples (elevated) and 2 Hb F samples
(elevated) were tested. The Hb F samples were only used in the refrigerated versus frozen
comparison due to fresh sample availability, as Hb F samples were received from the vendor
refrigerated. Where appropriate, samples were freshly drawn and an aliquot was frozen at <-
70oC overnight and another aliquot was stored at refrigerated temperatures overnight. On the
following day, fresh samples were drawn again, and refrigerated/frozen samples were
equilibrated to room temperature for comparison. Comparisons were fresh to refrigerated,
fresh to frozen and refrigerated to frozen. Each Hb fraction level was analyzed 40 times over
the course of 5 runs. Results were within predetermined acceptable bias for all Hb samples
and conditions.

Not Applicable
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Not Applicable
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not Applicable
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A reference range was established for Hemoglobin A and Hemoglobin A2 on the V8 Nexus
Hemoglobin UltraScreen, using samples from 132 normal healthy individuals, studied across
three sites. The resulting reference range for each hemoglobin fraction is as follows:
• Hb A: 96.6 – 97.9%
• Hb A2: 2.1 – 3.4%
The level of Hb F in normal population is below the level quantifiable by the V8 Nexus
Hemoglobin UltraScreen assay. Thus, no reference interval was established for Hb F.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification appears complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
