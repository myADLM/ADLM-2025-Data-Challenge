A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The CEDIA Heroin Metabolite (6-AM) Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay for the in
vitro qualitative and/or semi-quantitative determination of the presence of heroin metabolite (6-
AM) in human urine at a cut-off concentration of 10 ng/mL. The assay is intended to be used in
laboratories and provides a rapid analytical screening procedure to detect 6-Acetylmorphine in
human urine. The assay is designed for use with a number of clinical chemistry analyzers. This
product is intended to be used by trained professionals only.
The semi-quantitative mode is for the purpose of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as Liquid
Chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish
quality control procedures.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/
mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.
Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly
when preliminary results are used. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Performance characteristics studies were conducted on the Horiba Pentra C400 clinical
chemistry analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
CEDIA Heroin Metabolite (6-AM) Assay is supplied as a two liquid buffers (1 and 2) and two
lyophilized reagents (1a and 1b) kit that is available in a kit configuration of 3x17mL.
Kit Constituents:
1 EA Reconstitution Buffer: Contains 0.32 mg/L mouse monoclonal antibodies to 6-
Acetylmorphine, buffer salts, stabilizer, detergent and preservative
1a EA Reagent: Contains 0.171 g/L Enzyme Acceptor, buffer salts, detergent and preservative.
2 ED Reconstitution Buffer: Contains buffer salts, stabilizer, and preservative
K192943 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
2a ED Reagent: Contains 16.2 μg/L Enzyme Donor conjugated to 6-Acetylmorphine, 1.67 g/L
chlorophenol red-β-D galactopyranoside, stabilizer, detergent, preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
CEDIA technology uses recombinant DNA technology to produce a homogeneous enzyme
immunoassay system. The assay is based on the bacterial enzyme β-galactosidase, which has
been genetically engineered into two inactive fragments. These fragments spontaneously re-
associate to form fully active enzymes that, in the assay format, cleave a substrate. This
generates a color change that can be measured spectrophotometrically.
In the CEDIA Heroin Metabolite (6-AM) Assay, the analyte in the sample competes with 6-AM
conjugated to Enzyme Donor (ED) for antibody binding sites. If 6-AM is present in the sample,
it binds to antibody, leaving the ED-6-AM conjugate free to re-associate with Enzyme Acceptor
(EA) to form active β-galactosidase. If no 6-AM is present in the sample, antibody binds to the
ED-6-AM conjugate, inhibiting the re-association of inactive -galactosidase fragments, and thus
reducing the amount of active enzyme formed. The amount of active enzyme formed, and
resultant absorbance change are proportional to the amount of 6-AM present in the sample.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP05-A3 at one site
with one analyzer and two lots of reagents. The study was performed for 20 days with two
runs per day, at least two hours apart and two replicates per run in both Qualitative and Semi-
quantitative modes, giving a total of 80 determinants (n = 80). Drug-free negative urine was
spiked with 6-Acetylmorphine analyte to final concentrations of -100%, -75%, -50%, -25%,
below cutoff, at cutoff and +25%, +50%, +75% and +100%, above cutoff. The concentration
of the spiked samples was confirmed by LC-MS/MS or GC/MS. The results from a
representative lot are summarized in the tables below.

2. Analytical Recovery and Dilution Linearity:
To demonstrate linearity of the assay throughout the calibration range of 0 to 20 ng/mL, a
drug free–urine pool spiked with 6-AM at 20 ng/mL was serially diluted with drug free urine
to generate ten intermediate levels. Each sample was run in replicates of five in semi-

expected target value. The observed result (y) and the target expected result (x) were
compared using the least squares regression method. The regression equation and correlation
obtained are:
y = 0.9692x + 0.4923; r2 = 0.9986
The recovery of the samples from the linear range of the assay (0 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL)
prepared by dilution ranged from 97.3% to 115.6%.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity:
Cross-reactivity of the structurally related and unrelated compounds with the performance of
the candidate device was evaluated by adding known amounts of each compound to drug-
free negative urine. The samples were tested in duplicate with the candidate device in both
the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Percent cross-reactivity, in semi-quantitative
mode, is calculated as follows: % Cross-reactivity = (Cutoff concentration / Lowest
concentration of cross reactant that gives a positive result) x 100

Interference with Commonly Used Drugs:
Interference from commonly co-administered drugs with 6-AM was evaluated by spiking
these compounds into urine samples containing 6-AM at +/-25% of the cut-off levels (7.5
ng/mL and 12.5 ng/mL). The samples were tested in duplicate with the candidate device in
both the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. The following list of potentially interfering
compounds showed no interference at the indicated concentration when tested with the
candidate device.

Interference with Endogenous Substances:
The potential interference of endogenous physiologic substances on recovery of 6-AM using
the candidate device was assessed by spiking these potentially interfering substances into
drug free urine spiked with 6-AM at 7.5 ng/mL and 12.5 ng/mL concentrations. The samples
were tested in replicates of five with the candidate device in both the qualitative and semi-
quantitative modes. In the presence of the compounds listed below, the controls are detected
accurately, indicating that these compounds do not interfere with the candidate device.

The pH of drug-free urine samples was adjusted to be pH 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, and
the samples were spiked with 6-AM to +/-25% of the cutoff (7.5 ng/mL and 12.5 ng/mL).
The samples were tested in replicates of five with the candidate device in both the qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes. The results demonstrated that the pH does not affect the
performance of the candidate.

Effect of Specific Gravity:
The specific gravity of drug-free urine samples was adjusted ranging in value within 1.002 to
1.029. These samples were split and spiked to a final concentration of either 7.5 ng/mL or
12.5 ng/mL of 6-AM (+/-25% of the cutoff). The samples were tested in replicates of five
with the candidate device in both the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. The results
demonstrated that specific gravity of the urine in the range 1.002 to 1.029 does not affect the
performance of the candidate.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted using one lot of the reagents. One hundred and
three unaltered clinical samples were analyzed using the candidate device in one replicate in
both the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes and the results were compared to LC-
MS/MS. The results obtained in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes are summarized
below:
