The AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden Genetic Health Risk Test is to be performed using the Tecan
Evo and Illumina iScan instruments.
GenomeStudio Software is a modular software application that is used to view and analyze
genotypic data obtained from the Illumina iScan System and based on the cluster definition file.
AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden Genetic Health Risk Test software conducts a variety of control
checks on the file, resulting in a final genotype profile for each sample. These data are used to
generate test reports on a user’s genotype and associated risk of disease.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The AncestryDNA Genetic Health Risk (GHR) Test for Factor V Leiden is intended for the
detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the F5 gene associated with Hereditary
Thrombophilia from human saliva collected in the AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit (SCK).
The user’s saliva is self-collected using the AncestryDNA SCK, which consists of a single-use
sealable collection tube containing a stabilizing buffer solution. Once the sample is collected, it
is shipped to one of two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified
laboratories for processing, testing and analysis. DNA is extracted, fragmented and tested with
the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test, a multiplex assay using a customized genotyping
chip and instrumentation manufactured by Illumina. The multiplex assay simultaneously tests for
more than 500,000 variants, including those for the indication proposed herein.
The raw data is generated using the Illumina GenomeStudio software and then delivered to
Ancestry Genomics for analysis using the proprietary AncestryDNA GHR Software. A genotype
is determined for each tested variant. The results for the Factor V Leiden variant are used to
generate personalized reports for users which provide information about the disease associated
with the detected variant.
Personalized reports are generated for each user that provide results of the testing performed.
These reports tell the user which variant(s) has/have been detected in their sample and provide
information on the risk of disease associated with the variant(s). If no variant was detected, that
information is also provided. The personalized reports are designed to present scientific concepts
to users in an easy-to-understand format. The reports provide scientific information about the
risks associated with the presence of a particular variant. The reports are designed to help users
understand the meaning of their results and any appropriate actions that may be taken based on
their results.
B Principle of Operation:
The AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test is performed by CLIA-certified laboratories using
the BeadChip v10 assay (Illumina Infinium HumanOmniExpress-24 format chip) on the Illumina
Infinium platform. Samples collected using the AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit are delivered
to laboratories for testing and analysis. DNA from saliva is extracted and quantified. Samples
K192944 - Page 3 of 17

--- Page 4 ---
with DNA concentrations in the range of 1.53 ng/µL – 50 ng/µL are eligible for further
processing. These samples are fragmented and captured on a bead array by hybridization to
immobilized variant-specific primers, followed by extension with hapten-labeled nucleotides.
The primers hybridize adjacent to the variants and are extended with a single nucleotide
corresponding to the variant allele. The incorporated hapten-modified nucleotides are detected by
adding fluorescently labeled antibodies in several steps to amplify the signals. The Tecan Evo
and Illumina iScan instruments are used for extraction and processing of the DNA, and the
BeadChip for scanning and quantification of the results. Genotypes are determined using the
GenomeStudio software package and delivered to Ancestry Genomics for analysis using the
AncestryDNA GHR software.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The purpose of the precision studies was to determine the imprecision of the AncestryDNA
Factor V Leiden GHR Test under the following changed conditions: assay run, critical
reagent lot, instrument, operator, day and site. Saliva samples from nine donors, three for
each genotype (homogenous common – GG, heterozygous – GA and homozygous rare –
AA), were collected with three lots of the Ancestry DNA Saliva Collection Kit. Genotypes of
these samples were confirmed through bi-directional sequencing.
The precision studies were performed at two independent CLIA-certified testing laboratories
(Lab 1 and Lab 2). Saliva samples were genotyped by the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden
GHR Test using three lots of critical reagents by six different operator teams (three per
laboratory) on eight instrument combinations (four per laboratory) over multiple days. The
precision study yielded 100% correct genotype calls for all samples with a valid call across
multiple days, operator teams, instruments and reagent lot at both laboratory sites.
Information regarding samples that failed quality control (FQC) was also evaluated. Sample
replicates that did not pass sample call rate (SCR) QC in the first run underwent second, and
when eligible, third genotyping run per laboratory standard operating procedures (SOPs).
The overall precision exceeded 99% point estimate. The results of the study are demonstrated
in the tables below.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The study was to establish the analytical specificity of the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden
GHR Test from samples collected using the AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit (SCK) by
evaluating the impact of potential endogenous interferents on assay performance. A series of
studies were conducted to assess the effects of endogenous substances, exogenous
substances, microbial substances and mutation on the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR
Test.
i. Endogenous Interference
Saliva samples from ten donors were collected using the AncestryDNA SCK and their
genotypes were determined with bi-directional sequencing. The endogenous substances
were individually spiked into saliva prior to DNA extraction and genotyping. Saliva
spiked with PBS served as the control. The results indicated that the performance of the
AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test is not affected by salivary α-amylase (395
U/mL), hemoglobin (20 mg/mL), IgA (0.44 mg/mL) and total protein (including 0.185
mg/mL salivary α-amylase, 0.44 mg/mL IgA and 2.05 mg/mL human serum albumin).
ii. Exogenous Interference
The AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test requires the use of an FDA cleared saliva
collection kit (K192947). The saliva collection kit includes Instructions for Use (IFU)
instructing the user not to eat, drink, smoke, or chew gum for 30 minutes prior to
collecting their saliva, thus minimizing the presence of interferents in the sample. The
saliva collection IFU was tested for user comprehension and a paper version of the IFU is
included in every collection kit. Should an interfering substance be present after DNA has
been extracted and an insufficient concentration or quality of DNA is available, then the
sample is managed per standard operating procedures that are pre-determined by the
manufacturer.

iii. Microbial Interference
Microbial DNA from Staphylococcus epidermis, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus
casei, Actinomyces odontolyticus and Candida albicans were tested to determine their
impact on the performance of the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test. DNA from
each of the six human cell lines was spiked with two concentrations (low/normal: 2.8
ng/µL; high: 12.5 ng/µL) of the five different species of microbial DNA. The results
indicate that there is no significant impact of common microbial interferents on the
performance of the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR test in either low/normal or high
concentrations.
iv. Mutational Interference
An in silico analyses was performed to identify potential interfering variants within the
50 nucleotide probe-binding region downstream of the variant being detected. The
genome aggregation database (gnomAD database) was utilized to search for mutations in
this region. Only mutations that have been observed in more than one individual were
evaluated. Three potential interfering mutations (rs770011773, rs773367113 and
rs143663052) were identified for the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test. The
impact of these mutations on the performance of the assay has not been evaluated.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test uses one control material, which serves as
both the sample processing control and the reproducibility control. The control material is
genotyped on the Illumina BeadChip according to the standard of procedures at the
laboratory. Each new lot of the control is tested by comparison with reference BeadChip
genotype results.
The stability studies are ongoing and current data support a shelf-life stability claim of one
month and an in-use stability claim of 30 days when the control material is stored at 2–8˚C.
6. Detection Limit:
i. Limit of Blank
The Limit of Blank (LoB) study was performed to incorporate measurement variability
due to the noisy nature of UV-Vis spectroscopy and potentially erroneous fluorescence
signal in the assay. A plate of 95 blanks containing 1 mL of molecular grade water and
the standard volume of DNA stabilizing solution from the AncestryDNA Saliva
Collection Kit was extracted, quantified and genotyped using three lots of critical
reagents. LoB calculation was performed using the non-parametric rank method in
accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. No blanks returned a sample call rate above 98%. The
LoB was determined to be 1.004 ng/µL.
K192944 - Page 10 of 17

--- Page 11 ---
ii. Limit of Detection
The Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed to establish the lowest concentration
of DNA obtained from the AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit that is necessary when
tested with the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test to successfully assign the
correct variant. The study used both saliva samples from 15 donors (five for each
genotype) and DNA from four cell lines. DNA from each sample was diluted to multiple
concentrations and genotyped by the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test using
three lots of critical reagents. To confirm the genotype call, each sample was also
sequenced by bi-directional sequencing. The LoD was defined as the lowest DNA
concentration at which at least 95% of samples yielded the correct call and statistically
different from LoB. The LoD was determined to be 1.53 ng/µL. The manufacturer has
also claimed the upper limit of DNA concentration of 50 ng/µL.

i. Accuracy
The accuracy study was performed at one laboratory site to calculate the agreement of the
genetic variant determination between the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test and
results from bi-directional sequencing. Saliva samples were collected from 209 donors
with known Factor V Leiden genotypes: 73 homozygous common (GG), 69 heterozygous
(GA) and 67 homozygous rare (AA). Of the 200 samples initially genotyped, 11 samples
failed the sample call rate (SCR) quality control (QC) and nine alternate samples were
added to the same cohort, all of which passed SCR QC on the first run. All samples were
genotyped using bi-directional sequencing to determine their true variant status.
Genotyping results were compared between the GHR test and bi-directional sequencing
to calculate percent agreement with the sequencing results considered to be “truth”. The
percent agreement for each genotype, the overall percent agreement and confidence
intervals were calculated based on a binomial distribution. Data analysis results did not
include FQC samples. The results of the study are summarized in the tables below.

One copy, heterozygote 4.22 (3.35 to 5.32)
Two copies, homozygote 5.45 (6.79 to 19.29)
To support test results, a meta-analysis study conducted by Simone et al. (2013) was used to
calculate likelihood ratios (LR, an estimate of how the test result affects the chances of a
condition). Post-test risk (R ) was calculated from the LR and using a pre-test risk (R ) of
post pre
11% from the 2018 ACMG venous thromboembolism laboratory testing standard (Zhang,
2018)2. LR and 95% confidence intervals calculated using a normal approximation are listed

recruit study participants representative of the U.S. population according to education,
age, sex/gender and race/ethnicity.
In Study 1, geographic diversity was addressed through participant recruitment and
comprehension testing was conducted from each of the four U.S. census regions: South,
Midwest, Northeast and West. Approximately 120 participants were tested at each
location. These subjects were randomly assigned to each of the four study arms, testing
comprehension of four GHR Test reports:
• 0 Variants Identified
• 1 Variant Identified
• 2 Variants Identified
• Result Not Determined
The study was conducted in person and each interview session was administered by a
trained interviewer/moderator using a series of pre-defined questions. Participants were
given a time limit from start of report review to completion of the comprehension study.
After excluding several participants according to pre-defined exclusion criteria, the final
378 participants completed the survey talk for the four AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden
GHR Test reports and were included in the endpoint analysis. The manufacturer
determined comprehension accuracy rates for multiple core comprehension concepts. The
comprehension assessment addressed the overall comprehension and the following core
comprehension concepts: purpose of test, limitations of test, ethnic relevance, results of
test, other risk factors and appropriate follow-up action.
In Study 2, geographically diverse participants were randomly assigned to each of two
study arms, representing the two most challenging reports:
• 1 Variant Identified
• Result Not Determined
The study was conducted via live tele-video interview and each interview session was
administered online by a trained interviewer/moderator using a series of pre-defined
questions. After excluding participants per pre-defined exclusion criteria, a total of 213
individuals completed the study and were included in the endpoint analysis.
Both studies were performed on the different types of the GHR Test reports developed
using representative samples of the materials below (supplemental materials):
• Education Module including definition of terms
• Pre-purchase page
• Frequently Asked Questions, and
• Technical Details
The representative samples were developed per FDA guidance for medical device patient
labeling and designed for readability no higher than a defined reading level using a
Flesch-Kincaid Readability test. The representative samples were reviewed by a Certified
Genetic Counselor to confirm that the materials tested accomplished the following:
K192944 - Page 14 of 17

--- Page 15 ---
• Defined the target condition being tested and related symptoms
• Explained the intended use and limitations of the test
• Explained the relevant ethnicities in regard to the variant tested
• Explained genetic health risks and relevance to the user’s ethnicity, and
• Assessed participants’ ability to understand the following comprehension
concepts: the test’s limitations, purpose, appropriate follow-up action, test
results, ethnic relevance and other risk factors that may have an impact on the
test results.
For both studies, the completion rate was 100% (378/378 for Study 1 and 213/213 for
Study 2) for all subjects who appeared for their interviews in the study after passing the
pre-defined exclusion criteria. The average comprehension rates per core comprehension
concept were 90.7% to 97.4% for Study 1 and 90.9% to 99.1% for Study 2. The overall
comprehension score across all GHR reports was 93.2% for Study 1 and 96% for Study
2.
