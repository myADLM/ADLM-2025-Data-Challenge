A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit is intended for use in the noninvasive collection of
saliva samples for in vitro diagnostic testing of human DNA. Saliva may be collected by spitting
directly into the AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit by a lay user. Saliva samples collected
using the AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit are stabilized and isolated for use with over-the-
counter AncestryDNA Genetic Health Risk Tests. Saliva samples collected using the
AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit can be transported and/or stored long term at ambient
conditions.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit is for use with AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden Genetic
Health Risk Test.
This kit is intended for users 18 years of age and older.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit consists of saliva collection tube, funnel, cap, blister
pack, collection bag with an absorbent pad. The cap contains DNA stabilization solution. Saliva
is delivered directly by spitting into the collection tube via the funnel. A cap is provided that
releases the stabilization solution and closes the tube for transport and storage.
B Principle of Operation:
The AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit is used for collecting and stabilizing human DNA
from saliva and for the transportation and long-term ambient room temperature storage of a
saliva sample. Saliva is delivered directly by expectorating into the collection tube via the funnel.
Once the user has provided the saliva sample, the user removes the funnel from the saliva
collection tube and affixes the cap. Affixing the cap by screwing on releases the stabilization
solution. The Instructions for Use instruct the user to shake the tube for at least five seconds to
mix the saliva sample with the stabilization solution. Samples can be immediately processed,
transported, or stored for future use. Device and sample integrity are preserved during typical
ambient transport and storage conditions for up to 12 months.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Between-Site Reproducibility
A reproducibility study was performed at 2 laboratory sites. Saliva samples from nine donors
of known Factor V Leiden genotypes (3 homozygous common, 3 heterozygous, and 3
homozygous rare) were genotyped in triplicate across three plates per site (a total of 162
genotyping events) to evaluate the reproducibility of the performance of the AncestryDNA
Saliva Collection Kit (SCK) when used with the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden Genetic
Health Risk (GHR) Test (see k192944). Samples were accepted or rejected using the quality
control (QC) criteria of a sample call rate (SCR) or overall call rate per sample of ≥ 98%
across the entire array. At the first site, all donor replicates passed QC for the first genotyping
run. At the second site, 14.8% (12/81) of replicates failed first pass QC. All replicates
(100%) passed the second genotyping run and yielded 100% concordant results with the
expected genotype, determined by bi-directional sequencing.
Within-Run and Within-Laboratory Precision
A within-run precision study was conducted at one site with nine donor saliva samples of
known Factor V Leiden genotypes (3 homozygous common, 3 heterozygous, and 3
homozygous rare). Samples were tested using the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test
(see k192944) in replicates of five. All forty-five replicates passed QC in the first genotyping
run and yielded 100% concordant results with the expected genotype, determined by bi-
directional sequencing.
A within-laboratory precision study was conducted with nine donor saliva samples of known
Factor V Leiden genotypes (3 homozygous common, 3 heterozygous, and 3 homozygous
rare). Samples were tested using the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test across
multiple AncestryDNA SCK lots, operator teams and days at two laboratory sites. At the first
site, 0.3% (6/1719) of replicates failed first pass QC. Three of these six replicates passed QC
after the second genotyping run, leaving a total of 3 out of 1,719 replicates (0.2%) that failed
QC. The 1,716 replicates that passed QC yielded 100% concordant results with the expected
genotype, determined by bi-directional sequencing. At the second site, 3.2% (20/621) of
replicates failed first pass QC. All replicates (100%) passed the second genotyping run and
yielded 100% concordant results with the expected genotype, determined by bi-directional
sequencing.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable.
K192947 - Page 4 of 10

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Effect of Endogenous Interfering Substances:
An endogenous substance interference study was conducted with salivary α-amylase (395
U/ml), hemoglobin (20 mg/mL), immunoglobulin A (IgA) (0.44 mg/mL), and total protein
(0.185 mg/mL salivary α-amylase + 0.44 mg/mL IgA + 2.05 mg/mL human serum albumin).
Five saliva samples from each of ten (10) donors were pooled, divided into five aliquots, and
spiked with one of the four interfering substances or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for the
control sample. Samples were genotyped using the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden Genetic
Health Risk Test (see k192944) in triplicate for a total of 150 genotyping events. All samples
were evaluated for the effect of the substance on sample call rate (SCR) and percent
agreement with the true variant status, as determined by bi-directional sequencing. Three (3)
replicates from one donor required a second genotyping run after failing sample quality
control (sample call rate ≥ 98%) on the first genotyping attempt. All specimens spiked with
endogenous substances passed the quality control metric and demonstrated 100%
concordance for all interfering substances.
Effect of Exogenous Interfering Substances:
Potentially interfering exogenous substances introduced into saliva samples through the
following activities were assessed: eating beef, eating chicken, drinking alcohol, chewing
gum, using mouthwash, and smoking. Each group of 12 donors ate chicken, drank alcohol, or
used mouthwash. Each group of 10 donors ate beef, chewed gum, or smoked. Each donor
provided three samples: a baseline/control sample taken at least 2 hours prior to the activity,
a sample collected immediately after the activity, and a sample collected 30 minutes after the
activity. All samples were evaluated for the effect of the substance on sample call rate and
percent agreement with the true variant statues, as determined by bi-directional sequencing.
For all genotyping events where the control samples passed QC, there was 100% agreement
between the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test (see k192944) results and bi-
directional DNA sequencing for all activities, demonstrating no effect of any interfering
substances on genotyping.
For the eating chicken and eating beef activities, a higher rate of QC failures for samples
collected immediately after completing the activity compared to matched donor control
samples was observed. The AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit includes the following
sentence as part of the saliva collection warning: “Do NOT eat, drink, smoke, or chew gum
for 30 minutes before giving your saliva sample.”
Please refer to k192944 for additional interference study information.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Pre-collection shelf-life stability
For pre-collection stability studies, the stability of the AncestryDNA SCK was assessed after
exposure to multiple storage conditions (i.e., frozen -30˚C to -15˚C, refrigerated 2˚C to 8˚C,
or room temperature 15˚C to 30˚C) prior to saliva sample collection and genotyping. For
each storage condition, saliva samples from 42 donors with unknown Factor V Leiden
genotypes were evaluated using 3 lots of AncestryDNA SCKs. DNA from donor saliva
samples was extracted and DNA concentration and purity were determined. Samples were
subjected to genotyping using the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test (see k192944)
and compared to the true variant status determined by bi-directional sequencing. Stability
testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Current
real-time data supports a pre-collection shelf-life stability claim of 12 months at 15˚C to
30˚C.
Post-collection sample stability
For post-collection stability studies, the stability of saliva-filled AncestryDNA SCKs
exposed to multiple storage conditions (i.e., frozen -30˚C to -15˚C, refrigerated 2˚C to 8˚C,
or room temperature 15˚C to 30˚C) prior to genotyping was assessed. For each storage
condition, saliva samples from 42 donors with unknown Factor V Leiden genotypes were
evaluated using 3 lots of AncestryDNA SCKs. DNA from donor saliva samples was
extracted and DNA concentration and purity were determined. Samples were subjected to
genotyping using the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test (see k192944) and compared
to the true variant status determined by bi-directional sequencing. Stability testing protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Current real-time data
supports a post-collection sample stability claim of 12 months at 15˚C to 30˚C.
Transport stability
Simulated transport stability studies were conducted to assess the effect of temperature and
humidity extremes on the AncestryDNA SCK. Pre- and post-collection AncestryDNA SCKs
were tested according to the ISTA 3A standard. After being subjected to simulated transport
conditions, pre-collection AncestryDNA SCKs were assessed for integrity (gross fluid
leakage) and the pH of the DNA stabilization solution relative to pH specifications was
determined. After being subjected to simulated transport conditions, post-collection
AncestryDNA SCKs were assessed for integrity (saliva volume relative to the fill line) and
ability to meet the sample call rate of > 98% prior to testing with the AncestryDNA Factor V
Leiden GHR Test (see k192944). Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The stability study data support pre-collection and post-
collection AncestryDNA SCK transport at temperatures ranging from -29ºC to 50ºC and 15%
to 85% relative humidity.

6. Detection Limit:
Sample Volume Tolerance
The AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit (SCK) is intended for collection of 1 mL of saliva.
A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of over or under filling the AncestryDNA SCK.
Donors provided saliva in three different devices with varying fill-to lines (0.5 mL, 1 mL,
and 1.5 mL). The volume of stabilizing liquid in each device was unchanged. The actual
amount of saliva collected as well as the impact of delivering less and more saliva on sample
call rate (SCR) and genotype testing were examined. A total of 240 DNA samples from 80
donors (60 homozygous common, 15 heterozygous, and 5 homozygous rare) were analyzed
for SCR ≥ 98% and were tested with the Ancestry DNA Factor V Leiden Genetic Health
Risk (GHR) Test (see k192944). The study was conducted using 1 lot of AncestryDNA SCK
and 3 lots of reagent at one site by 8 operators.
The saliva volumes collected were normally distributed around the fill-to lines, with the
mean volumes being equal to the fill-to volume plus the 0.9 mL of DNA stabilizing solution
in the AncestryDNA SCK. The median amount of saliva collected was typically just above
the fill-to line (0.55 mL [0.5 mL target], 1.06 mL [1 mL target], 1.51 mL [1.5 mL target]).
The study demonstrated that as the fill-to line increases to “over-fill” at 1.5 mL, the quality
control (QC) failure rate (SCR ≥ 98%) also increases (see table below). Nine (9) out of 240
samples failed sample call rate QC. The QC failures were not donor-specific. Seven (7) of
the 9 failed samples were from the over-filled tubes, and 8 of the 9 failed samples were from
donors with the wild type genotype. The point estimates of overall percent agreement
between bi-directional sequencing and AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test showed
100% agreement across all fill volumes and genotypes evaluated for all samples that passed
the quality control criteria of ≥ 98% (see table below). The labeling includes the statement
“Do not overfill” in the instructions for use to minimize the downstream impact to sample
processing.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed to determine the accuracy of the genotype
obtained for 209 saliva samples collected from unique donors using the Ancestry DNA
Saliva Collection Kit and tested with the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test (see
k192944) compared to bi-directional sequencing of saliva samples collected using the
predicate Oragene Dx OGD-500.001 collection device (k141410). All genotyping using the
GHR were performed at one site. Samples were accepted if the sample call rate (SCR) was ≥
98%. For all samples that passed the sample call rate quality control (198/209), the genotypes
were 100% (69/69 homozygous common, 65/65 heterozygous, and 64/64 homozygous rare)
concordant with those from the same donor saliva samples collected in the predicate
collection device and tested using bi-directional sequencing (see table below). The 95%
confidence interval for all genotypes was 98.2–100% and the “no-call” rate was 0% with a
95% confidence interval of 0-1.8%. See k192944 for additional information.

Performance of the AncestryDNA Saliva Collection Kit when used in the over-the-counter
intended use setting of the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden Genetic Health Risk (GHR) Test
(see k192944) was evaluated. Study participants were recruited to four facilities across the
U.S., representing the four U.S. census regions (i.e., South, Midwest, Northeast, and West).
Participants aged 18 years of age and older were recruited to match the demographics (i.e.,
education attainment, age, sex at birth, and race/ethnicity) of the adult U.S. population per
the most recent estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau. Participants were asked to
participate in a self-administered saliva sample collection process and completed kits were
collected by the interviewer and mailed to the Ancestry Genomics laboratory for processing.

Upon receipt at the testing laboratory, each study sample was assessed for viability. For a
submitted sample to be considered a success (or viable), the sample was required to pass the
following three test points: (1) AncestryDNA SCK Kit Received/Accessioning (e.g.,
AncestryDNA SCK appropriately capped and not leaking), (2) Extraction (i.e., saliva sample
is able to be extracted), and (3) DNA Call Rate (i.e., sample contains an adequate amount of
DNA for testing if the sample call rate is ≥ 98%). User comprehension of test instructions,
including comprehension of sample collection instructions was also assessed.
A total of 271 individuals completed the user comprehension survey and provided a saliva
sample for analysis. Of the 271 samples evaluated, 14 failed one of the three test points (4
accessioning failures, no extraction failures, and 10 DNA call rate failures), resulting in a
total of 257 samples passing QC metrics (94.8%). The subgroup analyses, by education
attainment, age, sex at birth, and race/ethnicity, are shown below. The results demonstrated
that users were able to follow sample collection instructions to obtain adequate sample for
testing. See the AncestryDNA Factor V Leiden GHR Test (k192944) for additional user
comprehension information.
A Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on the collection device labeling and a
reading grade level of 6.0 was obtained for the overall instruction card and a reading grade
level of 7.1 was obtained for the text alone.
