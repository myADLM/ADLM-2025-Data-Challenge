III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
VivaChek™ Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitoring System is comprised of the VivaChek™
Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Meter (VGM200), the VivaChek™ Ino Blood Glucose Test Strips
(VGS01) and the VivaChek™ Blood β-Ketone Test Strips (VKS01).
The VivaChek™ Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitoring System is intended to quantitatively
measure the glucose concentration and/or β-ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate) concentration in fresh
capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips. It is intended for use by persons with
diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. It is not intended for
neonatal use or for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes. This system is intended for self-
testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use), and should only be used by a single person and
should not be shared.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
For single-patient use only. Not for multiple patient use.
Very high (above 65%) and very low (below 20%) hematocrit levels can cause false results. Talk
to your healthcare professional to find out your hematocrit level.
The effect of oxygen therapy on the results of this system has not been studied.
Severe dehydration (excessive water loss) may cause inaccurate results.
Not for neonatal use.
Not for use on patients with critical illness.
Not for use in hypotensive individuals or on patients in shock or in a hyperosmolar state.
Not for screening or diagnosis of diabetes.
Do not use the system at altitudes above 13123ft (4000 meters) above sea level for testing.
Do not use when humidity is higher than 90% and lower than 10%, as extremes in humidity may
affect results.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The meter is not intended for use in healthcare or assisted-use settings such as hospitals,
physician offices, or long-term care facilities because it has not been cleared by FDA for use in
these settings, including for routine assisted testing or as part of glycemic control procedures.
Use of this device on multiple patients may lead to transmission of Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or other bloodborne pathogens.
D Special Instrument Requirements:

--- Page 3 ---
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
VivaChekTM Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitoring System consists of a the VivaChekTM
Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Meter (VGM200), the VivaChekTM Ino Blood Glucose Test Strips
(VGS01), the VivaChekTM Blood β-Ketone Test Strips (VKS01), blood glucose control
solutions, blood β-ketone control solutions, a lancing device, lancets, a user manual, package
inserts, quick reference guide warranty card, and carrying case. The device is packaged as a
single system (with all components described above), as well as packaged so that subsets of the
system components may be purchased separately.
The previously cleared VivaChek™ Ino Plus blood glucose meter (k173140) has been modified
to add a ketone measurement function in this submission.
B Principle of Operation:
The VivaChekTM Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitoring System is a quantitative assay for the
detection of glucose and/or β-ketone in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the
fingertips.
The test principle of the β-ketone is based on the amperometric detection of β-hydroxybutyrate
(also known as 3-hydroxybutyrate) in whole blood. β-hydroxybutyrate is converted by the
enzyme β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase to acetoacetate. The magnitude of electrical current
resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to the amount of β-hydroxybutyrate present
in the sample and the resulting β-ketone value is displayed on the meter.

candidate device and with the Randox RANBUT D-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay run on the
Randox RX Imola chemistry analyzer, as the comparator method to verify the concentrations.
Ten replicates were tested per meter per concentration with each of the three lots of the test
strips. The results are summarized below:
Concentration (mmol/L) N Mean SD %CV
0.1-0.6 300 0.32 0.04 11.4%
0.9-1.5 300 1.30 0.06 4.7%

4.0-5.0 300 4.37 0.16 3.6%
6.0-8.0 300 6.76 0.24 3.6%
Intermediate Precision study:
Intermediate precision was evaluated using three lots of the blood ketone test strips with 10
meters. Three levels of control solutions were used. For each control, ten replicates were taken
each day for ten days, so that 100 individual measurements were generated per control level. The
results from all strip lots are summarized below:
Sample N Mean SD %CV
Level 1 300 0.61 0.04 6.5%
Level 2 300 2.23 0.08 3.5%
Level 3 300 4.48 0.17 3.8%
2. Linearity:
The linearity of the Ketone Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood
spiked with β-hydroxybutyrate. Twelve whole blood samples were adjusted to the following
β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations: 0.07, 0.25, 0.53, 1.04, 1.79, 2.32, 3.15, 4.14, 5.02, 6.33,
7.37, and 8.52 mmol/L. Each blood ketone concentration was tested on the candidate device,
as well as with Randox RANBUT D-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the Randox RX Imola
chemistry analyzer as a comparator method to determine expected concentration. The
summary of the of the linear regression analysis for each lot was as follow:
Test Strip Lot Slope y-intercept R2 values
Lot 1 1.01 0.06 0.9989
Lot 2 1.00 0.00 0.9987
Lot 3 0.99 0.02 0.9988
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed (β-ketone) measuring range of 0.1-8.0
mmol/L.
Validation testing was performed demonstrating that the meter displays ‘HI” when the
measurement result is greater than 8.0 mmol/L and “LOW” when the measurement result is
less than 0.1 mmol/L, as intended.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To evaluate interference of exogenous and endogenous interfering substances, three venous
whole blood samples with ketone concentrations of 0.4 mmol/L, 1.2 mmol/L and 4.5 mmol/L
were divided into two aliquots: control (with no added potential interferent) and test (with
assessed potential interferent). Each sample was tested using 10 meters and the difference
between meter results obtained with the test sample compared to the control samples
calculated. The sponsor defined no significant interference as bias within 0.225 mmol/L for
β-ketone < 1.5 mmol/L and ≤ 15% for β-ketone ≥1.5 mmol/L. The following table lists the
highest tested concentration of each substance at which no significant interference was

The labeling includes the following limitations:
• Do not use this system if you are taking vitamin C (ascorbic acid in your blood > 3
mg/dL) since it could cause your glucose and ketone results to be incorrect.
• The system should not be used following xylose absorption procedures.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
0.1 - 8.0 mmol/L
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The VivaChekTM Blood Ketone Monitoring system is traceable to an in-house standard
prepared from commercially available control materials. The method comparison / lay user
study was performed using the Randox RANBUT D-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX
Imola chemistry analyzer (see Section VII.C.3).
Test strip stability:
The Ketone Test Strips are provided in vials. The shelf life stability was assessed with real-
time testing. The study protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable
to support the sponsor’s claimed stability of 18 months when stored under recommended
storage conditions of 39°F – 86°F (4-30°C) and relative humidity of 10-85%.

Lay-user accuracy study:
To assess the performance of the VivaChekTM Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitoring
System in the hands of the intended users, a lay user study was conducted with 102 lay user
participants using three lots of ketone test strips. Each lay user participant self-tested their
own fingertip capillary blood using the VivaChekTM Blood β-Ketone Monitoring System
unassisted and was instructed to use instructions provided in the labeling written in English.
The lay user β-ketone measurements were compared to those obtained with the Randox
RANBUT D-3-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the RX Imola chemistry analyzer. The range of β-
ketone concentrations across all subjects was 0.11 to 1.52 mmol/L. Each sample was
measured in singlicate. The results are summarized below:

following the instructions for use in the User’s Manual and the overall performance of the
VivaChekTM Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitoring System.
Readability: The readability of the over-the counter, home use labeling was evaluated using a
Flesch-Kincaid analysis and demonstrated that the grade level scores were less than 8th
grade.
