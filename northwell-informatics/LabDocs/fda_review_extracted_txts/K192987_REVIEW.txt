to a dedicated smartphone with the Aina Mobile Application, the Aina Device for optical test
strip readout, Aina HbA1c Test Kits which contain all the reagents necessary for running each
K192987 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
HbA1c test. The smartphone is provided with the device system by the manufacture and has had
functionalities that are not needed for running the HbA1c test locked down prior to providing it
to customers. The Aina Device is a reflectance based colorimetric sensor device that connects to
the mobile device through the audio jack. The smartphone runs the Aina Mobile Application that
allows for user interaction and illustrates the step by- step testing process on its touchscreen.
Streck A1c-Cellular control solutions can be used for regular quality control checking of the
system.
B Principle of Operation:
The Aina HbA1c Test utilizes the boronate affinity method. The Aina HbA1c Test Kit consists
of test strips, reagents, wash buffers, capillary tubes for sample collection, and pipette tips. The
reagent contains a lysing agent and a blue boronic acid conjugate. When blood is added to the
reagent, the erythrocytes are lysed and all hemoglobin precipitates. The boronic acid conjugates
binds to the glycosylated hemoglobin. An aliquot of the reaction mixture is applied to the test
strip and all the precipitated hemoglobin, conjugate bound and unbound, remains on top of the
filter. Any unbound boronate is removed with the wash buffer. The precipitate is evaluated by
measuring the blue (glycosylated hemoglobin) and the red (total hemoglobin) color intensity
respectively with the Aina Device, the ratio between them being proportional to the percentage
of the glycosylated hemoglobin in the sample.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP06-A. Testing was conducted
using venous whole blood specimens collected in K2-EDTA tubes. Nine levels were
prepared across the measuring range and tested in replicates of five on the Aina system in
random order. Individual HbA1c readings for each intermediate dilution were plotted versus
the expected HbA1c concentration. The linear regression equation is shown below:
y = 1.01x - 0.08 R = 0.998
The linearity results support the sponsor’s claims that the assay is linear across the reportable
measuring interval of 4.4 to 13.4% HbA1c.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
A study was performed as per CLSI EP07-A3 using the Aina HbA1c Monitoring System 2 to
assess the known endogenous and exogenous substances that could interfere with the assay.
The study was conducted using venous whole blood specimens collected in K2- EDTA with
target HbA1c at the following levels following levels: <5.5% and Elevated 8-10 %. Each

blood sample was divided into two pools: a control sample and a test sample. The test sample
was spiked with each interfering substance at two different concentrations and data was
collected in fifteen replicates. If the lowest concentration of any interference sample tested
failed to pass the acceptance criterion, it was diluted and re-tested. The sponsor defined non-
significant interference ≤±5% deviation compared to the result of the control. Results
demonstrated that no significant interference was observed for the following substances up to
the listed concentrations.

Cross-Reactivity: Hemoglobin Derivatives
A study was performed using the Aina HbA1c Monitoring System 2 to assess the effect of
hemoglobin derivatives on the measurement of HbA1c. The study was conducted using
venous whole blood specimens collected in K2- EDTA tubes with target HbA1c of <5.5%
and 8-10%. Each blood sample was divided into two pools: a control sample and a test
sample. Acetylated hemoglobin was derived in the presence of acetylsalicyclic acid,
carbamylated hemoglobin was derived in the presence of sodium cyanate, and labile A1c was
derived in the presence of glucose. The test sample was spiked with each interfering
substance at two different concentrations and data was collected in fifteen replicates. The
sponsor defined non-significant interference as ≤±5% deviation compared to the result of the
control pool. The table below summarizes the results of this study.

Hemoglobin Variants
A study was performed to evaluate the interference effect of hemoglobin variants, as found in
patients with natural hemoglobinopathies, in the quantitative measurement of HbA1c using
the Aina system on venous whole blood samples. This study was completed as per the CLSI
EP07-A3 guidelines using venous whole blood patient samples containing at least one of the
following variants: HbC, HbD, HbE, HbS, HbF or HbA2. For a particular Hb variant to be
considered as not interfering with measurements on the Aina system, the relative percent
difference estimated from the Deming regression analysis should be under ±7% at
concentrations of approximately 6 %HbA1c and 9 %HbA1c. The studies demonstrate that
The labeling contains the following information regarding hemoglobin variant interference:
WARNING: The Aina HbA1c assay has significant negative interference from
Hemoglobin F (HbF). HbA1c results are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of
HbF, including those with known Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.
The results from the Aina HbA1c Monitoring System 2 show that there is no significant
interference for samples containing Hemoglobin C (≤ 50%), Hemoglobin D (≤43%),
Hemoglobin E (≤31%), Hemoglobin S (≤ 42%), and Hemoglobin A2 (≤ 6.5%).
