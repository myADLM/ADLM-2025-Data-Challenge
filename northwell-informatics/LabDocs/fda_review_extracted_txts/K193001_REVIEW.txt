B Indication(s) for Use:
The Albumin BCP assay is an in vitro diagnostic test used for the determination of albumin in
human serum or plasma. Albumin measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
numerous diseases primarily involving the liver or kidneys.
The assay is intended for professional use only.
For In Vitro Diagnostic use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
AU 680 Automatic Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Albumin BCP reagent is ready to use liquid reagent that is supplied in two configurations: fill
volume of 20 mL in a 20 mL wedge or 50 mL in a 50 mL wedge, 6 wedges/kit. The ingredients
in the reagent are acetate buffer (6.8%), stabilizer (4.38%), bromocresol purple (0.028%),
detergent (0.045%), and sodium azide (<0.1%).
B Principle of Operation:
Albumin is measured using the colorimetric method where at pH 5.0 – 5.5, albumin reacts with
bromocresol purple (BCP) forming a colored complex. The color intensity of this complex is
proportional to the concentration of albumin present in the sample measurement as an endpoint
reaction at 600/700nm.

Within run precision was established by testing two human serum-based control samples and
one human serum sample pool. Each sample was tested in 20 replicates per run, for 3 runs for
a total of 60 replicates per sample. Testing was performed on one AU680 Automatic analyzer
using 3 reagent lots. The results for one representative lot are summarized in the table below.
Sample N Mean (g/L) SD %CV
Level 1 60 21.5 0.2 0.9
Level 2 60 35.6 0.3 0.7
Level 3 60 50.3 0.2 0.4
Within-laboratory precision was established by testing one human serum pool and two
human serum-based control samples. Testing was performed for 20 days, 2 runs per day, 2
replicates per run for a total of 80 replicates per sample and a total of 240 total replicates.
Testing was performed on one AU680 Automatic analyzer using four lots of reagents.
The results for one representative lot are summarized in the table below:
Sample N Mean (g/L) Total %CV
Level 1 80 26.6 2.2
Level 2 80 40.7 2.1
Level 3 80 50.5 1.6
2. Linearity:
The linearity studies were performed following the CLSI EP06-A guideline. The studies
were performed on one AU680 analyzer using serum samples spiked with human albumin.
Low and high concentration pools were mixed and serial dilution samples (N=12) were
prepared and tested in triplicate. The results from each of three reagent lots were compared to
expected values. All three lots yielded similar results. The results of the linear regression
analysis from one representative lot run are summarized below:
Sample range tested Slope Intercept Claimed measuring range
(g/L) (g/L)
4.2 – 78.7 1.0 0.999 6.0 -70.0
The linear regression results support the claimed measuring range.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed according to the CLSI EP07 guideline.
Two serum pools were created with albumin concentrations of 35 g/L and 50 g/L, which
were spiked with potentially interfering substances. Results from the spiked samples were
compared to results from the same serum sample pools without addition of the potential
interferents (control samples). Significant interference was defined as more than ± 10% bias
from the test results of the spiked sample when compared to the control sample. The
following substances did not cause interference at the concentrations listed below:

The sponsor includes the following limitations for potential interferences in their labeling:
• CMPF (3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid) present in sera of patients
with renal failure has been reported to give falsely low albumin values.
• Negative bias of approximately 10 % has been observed on samples from patients
undergoing hemodialysis. Samples from patients with elevated serum creatinine levels, or
undergoing treatment with peritoneal dialysis, were unaffected.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
6.0 – 70.0 g/L
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The assay is traceable to ERM-DA 470k Reference Material.
6. Detection Limit:
Detection limit studies for were evaluated based upon CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
Limit of blank (LoB) studies were performed by testing 4 blank samples. Samples were
tested in replicates of 5 over 3 days, using 3 lots of reagents for a total of 60 results per lot.
LoB was defined as the highest result that can reasonably be expected from a blank sample
for a given error probability with α=0.05. The highest LoB of the three lots is reported as the
LoB in the labeling.
Limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed by testing 4 serum pool samples with low
analyte concentrations approximately 4-fold higher than the LoB. Samples were tested in
replicates of 5 over 3 days, using 3 lots of reagents, for a total of 60 results per lot. LoD was
calculated using the following equation: LoD= LoB + (SD x 1.652). The highest LoD of the
three lots is reported as the LoD in the labeling.
Limit of Quantitation studies were performed using 8 samples which were generated by
diluting a sample with an album in concentration of 12 g/L. Each of the 8 samples were
tested in 10 replicates over 3 days using 3 reagent lots for a total of 240 replicates per lot.
The sponsor defines LoQ as the concentration corresponding to a coefficient of variation of
20%. The highest LoQ of the three lots is reported as the LoQ in the labeling.
The results are summarized in the table below:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed by testing 128 serum samples spanning the entire
claimed assay range. Eight samples were contrived. Each sample was run in duplicate on the
predicate device (ADVIA Chemistry Albumin BCP on the Siemens ADVIA 2400) and
singlicate on the candidate device (Albumin BCP on the AU680 Automatic analyzer). The
singlicate test result from candidate test system was compared to the average of the results
from the comparator method using Passing-Bablok analysis. The results are summarized in
the table below:
Correlation Sample concentration
Slope Intercept N
coefficient (r) range tested (g/L)
0.94 1.01 0.992 128 7.8 – 67.1
2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed to demonstrate lithium heparin plasma and
K2EDTA plasma equivalency to serum. A total of seventy-seven matched sample pairs were
tested. Results obtained with serum samples using Albumin BCP on one AU680 were
compared results obtained from either lithium heparin plasma or K EDTA plasma samples.
