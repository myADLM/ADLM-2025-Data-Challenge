III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
N Latex FLC kappa and lambda are in-vitro diagnostic reagents for the quantitative
determination of free light chains (FLC), type kappa or type lambda in human serum and EDTA-
plasma. N Latex FLC kappa and lambda assays are used:
• as an aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma (MM) on the BN Systems
and Atellica CH Analyzer,
• as an aid in the diagnosis of amyloidosis (AL) on the BN Systems and Atellica CH
Analyzer,
• as an aid in the evaluation of Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance
(MGUS) on the BN Systems.
Results of FLC measurements should always be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory
and clinical findings.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Warning: The result of the FLC Kappa or FLC Lambda in a given specimen determined with
assays and or instrument platforms from different manufacturers can vary due to differences in
assay methods and reagent specificity. The results reported by the laboratory to the physician
must include the identity of the FLC Kappa or FLC Lambda assay used. Values obtained with
different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably.
Precaution:
• The performance of the N Latex FLC kappa and lambda has not been thoroughly studied in
IgM and Light Chain MGUS patients due to the low prevalence of these subtypes.
• Patients with decreased renal function may have elevated FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda.
• Sample populations excluded MGUS populations that were further diagnosed with a
disease/disorder in subsequent testing with another medical device such as human
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Thus, because the
samples were enriched the specificity of the test may be inflated.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
No modification is made to the kit components for the N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC
lambda cleared in K171742 and K182098. The assays are comprised of the following reagents
in liquid form:
• N latex FLC reagents: Consist of suspension of polystyrene particles coated with
monoclonal antibodies (mouse) to either human FLC Kappa or human FLC Lambda;
conjugate of S-adenosyl-cysteine/porcine thyreoglobin (<0.1 g/L); conjugate of S-
adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (<100 U/mL); dithiothreitol (<0.5 g/L). Preservative:
Sodium azide (<1 g/L)
• N FLC Supplementary Reagents A and B: N FLC Supplementary Reagent A contains
mouse immunoglobulin in buffered solution and N FLC Supplementary Reagent B: consist
of a buffered salt solution containing detergent. Preservatives in both Supplementary
reagents: Sodium azide (<1 g/L).
• N FLC Standard SL: Contains human free light chains proteins, human serum albumin and
protease inhibitors.
• N FLC Controls SL1 and SL2: contains human free light chain proteins, human serum
albumin and protease inhibitors.
B Principle of Operation:
No modification is made to the principle of operation for the N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex
FLC lambda cleared in K171742 and K182098.
The N Latex FLC kappa and lambda assays are based upon the principles of particle-enhanced
immunoassay. Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies to human free light
chains, type kappa or lambda, respectively, are agglutinated when mixed with samples
containing kappa and lambda free light chains. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed
through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the
respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known
concentration.

C Clinical Studies:
Clinical performance of the N Latex FLC kappa assay and the N Latex FLC lambda assay as an
aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma, and as an aid in the diagnosis of
amyloidosis was previously demonstrated in K171742 and K182098.
MGUS is a clinically asymptomatic premalignant clonal plasma cell or lymphoplasmacytic
proliferative disorder. The performance of the N Latex FLC kappa assay and the N Latex FLC
lambda assay as an aid in the evaluation of MGUS was investigated from the following
retrospective clinical studies:
Study 1:
A retrospective study was performed by testing a total of 121 samples from clinically confirmed
MGUS patients (with IFE positivity) and a total of 102 samples from clinically defined non-
MGUS patients with polyclonal immunostimulation (confirmed with SPEP/SIFE). The result of
the device was compared to the clinical diagnosis for each sample.
The cohort of 121 MGUS samples included 89 Non-IgM MGUS, 21 IgM MGUS, and 11 light
chain (LC) MGUS. All samples were tested for FLC kappa and lambda levels with N Latex FLC
kappa and lambda assays on BN II analyzer. FLC ĸ/λ ratios were also calculated for each
sample. The test result for MGUS positive or negative were based on the following criteria:
• For Non-LC MGUS, the test was considered as “MGUS Positive” or “Abnormal” when
abnormal FLC ĸ/λ ratio (outside reference interval, i.e., <0.53 or >1.51) with IFE
positivity was determined.
• For LC MGUS, the test was considered as “MGUS Positive” when abnormal FLC ĸ/λ
ratio (outside reference interval, i.e., <0.53 or >1.51) with elevated FLC kappa (>28.9
mg/L) or elevated FLC lambda FLC (> 32.6 mg/L) was determined.
Sixty-one (61) out of 121 MGUS cases were tested positive by the N Latex FLC kappa and N
Latex FLC lambda assay with a positive rate of 50.4% (95% CI: 41.2–59.6%). The distribution
of the cohort and the positivity rate for each clinical type of MGUS are summarized in the
following table:

LC MGUS (All) 11 10 (90.9%)
Kappa 6 5 (83.3%)
Lambda 5 5 (100.0%)
TOTAL 121 61 (50.4%)
The 102 samples from patients with confirmed non-MGUS polyclonal stimulation (polyclonal
hypergammaglobulinemia) were comprised of chronic inflammation or infection (55);
autoimmune diseases (12); cardiovascular diseases (13); cancer (4); liver diseases (2); respiratory
diseases (5); GI related diseases (3); and other diseases/conditions (8). Ninety-two (92) out of
102 of these non-MGUS samples were also determined as negative by the N Latex FLC kappa
and lambda assay, indicating a negative agreement of 90.2% (95% CI: 82.7–95.2%) in this
sample cohort. The 10 false positive samples were from patients with the following disorders:
polyclonal increase in the gamma globulin; Sjogren’s syndrome; liver-related disease;
hypervolemia; spinal cord injury; heart failure and nodular prostatic hyperplasia.
Limitation
In this study, sample populations excluded MGUS populations that were further diagnosed with
a disease/disorder in subsequent testing with another medical device such as human
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Thus, because the
samples were enriched the specificity of the test in the study may be inflated. Risk mitigation
strategies include use of the device in conjunction with other tests such as serum protein
electrophoresis and immunofixation blood tests. The labeling also included this limitation.
Study 2:
Another retrospective study was performed by testing 61 subjects with clinically stable MGUS
and four subjects with progressive clinical status converting from MGUS to multiple myeloma
(MM). Among 61 MGUS stable subjects, 50 patients were diagnosed with non-IgM MGUS (33
IgG K, nine IgG L, six IgA K, and two IgA L), eight patients with IgM MGUS (seven IgM K
and one IgM L), and three patients with LC MGUS (two kappa and one lambda). All four
subjects with progressive disease status were initially diagnosed with non-IgM MGUS (one IgG
K, one IgG L, one IgA K, and one IgA L).

At least four serial draws were collected from each patient and tested with the N Latex kappa and
lambda assays. FLC κ/λ ratio was calculated for even blood draw samples. Since the MGUS has
been identified as a precursor to malignant diseases (multiple myeloma or amyloidosis), but not
as a disease which requires treatment, no defined criteria in how to interpret consecutive FLC
results are available. Therefore, for device evaluation purposes only, the criteria for stable
MGUS and progressive MGUS based on test results in this study is defined as follows:
• For stable MGUS, FLC κ/λ ratio must be within the reference interval of 0.53 – 1.51 at
the time of the last draw AND a relative change of the involved FLC (iFLC) is <25% for
two consecutive assessments.
• For progressive MGUS, the FLC κ/λ ratio is outside of the reference interval (<0.53 or
>1.51) AND a relative change of the involved FLC (iFLC) is ≥25% for two consecutive
assessments.
Sixty (60) out of 61 clinically stable MGUS subjects were determined as stable by the test and
three out of four clinically progressive subjects were determined as progressive by the test.
Limitation
The study included time points of blood draws not indicative of clinical practice. Also, the
algorithm using only FLC had not been validated for progression of disease. Furthermore, a
small sample size (4 patients) with only one subtype (i.e., non-IgM MGUS) was used to study
progression in this study. Risk mitigation strategies include that this test is not a stand-alone test
for the evaluation of patients with MGUS and the test is to be utilized in conjunction with serum
protein electrophoresis and immunofixation blood tests.
