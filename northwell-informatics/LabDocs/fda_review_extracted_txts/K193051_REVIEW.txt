C Type of Test:
Chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA)
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus
The LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus assay uses chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA)
technology for the qualitative determination of IgG and IgM antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi
in human serum and plasma (K -EDTA, Li-heparin) samples. This assay is intended for use on
2
samples from patients with signs and symptoms that are consistent with Lyme disease. Positive
or equivocal results should be supplemented by testing with a standardized Western blot
procedure. Positive supplemental results provide evidence of exposure to B. burgdorferi and can
be used to support a clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease. Negative results by LIAISON Lyme
Total Antibody Plus assay should not be used to exclude Lyme disease. The test has to be
performed on the LIAISON XL Analyzer.
The LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus Control Set
The LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus Control Set is intended for use as assayed quality
control samples to monitor the performance of the LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus assay.
The performance characteristics of LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus Control Set have not
been established for any other assays or instrument platforms different from the LIAISON XL.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
LIAISON XL Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The method for qualitative determination of IgG and IgM antibodies to B. burgdorferi is an
indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). All assay steps (with the exception of
magnetic particle resuspension) and incubations are performed by the Analyzer. The principal
components of the test are magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with recombinant Borrelia
K193051 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
antigens and a conjugate reagent containing two mouse monoclonal antibodies (anti-human IgG
and anti- human IgM) linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate).
During the first incubation, anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies present in calibrators, samples
or controls bind to the solid phase. During the second incubation, the antibody conjugates react
with anti-Borrelia burgdorferi IgG and IgM antibodies that have bound to the solid phase. After
each incubation, unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter
reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal, and
hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative
light units (RLU) and is indicative of the presence of B. burgdorferi antibodies present in
calibrators, samples or controls.

1. Instrument Name:
LIAISON XL Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by barcode and each test parameter is identified via information
encoded in the Reagent Integral Radio Frequency Identification transponder (RFID Tag).
Control identification is detected by the bar code label or may be manually programmed into
the instrument. Follow the analyzer operator’s manual to start the run. Return controls to the
refrigerator immediately after each use.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Either human serum, SST serum, K -EDTA plasma and Lithium Heparin plasma may be
2
used in this assay. Blood should be collected aseptically by venipuncture. Serum samples
should be allowed to clot. Centrifuge samples and separate serum or plasma from the clot as
soon as possible. Samples having particulate matter, turbidity, lipemia, or erythrocyte debris
may require clarification by filtration or centrifugation before testing. Grossly hemolyzed or
lipemic samples as well as samples containing particulate matter or exhibiting obvious
microbial contamination should not be tested. Check for and remove air bubbles before
assaying. Samples are stable at room temperature for up to 8 hours. If the assay is performed
within 7 days of sample collection, the samples should be kept at 2-8°C; otherwise they

should be stored frozen (-20°C or below). If samples are stored frozen, mix thawed samples
well before testing. Samples may be frozen-thawed 5 times. Self-defrosting freezers are not
recommended for sample storage.
The minimum specimen volume required for a single determination is 155μL.
4. Calibration:
Individual LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus Reagent Integrals contain specific
information for calibration of the particular Reagent Integral lot. Test of assay specific
calibrators allows the detected relative light units (RLU) values to adjust the assigned master
curve. Each calibration solution allows (5) calibrations to be performed.
Recalibration in triplicate is mandatory whenever at least 1 of the following conditions
occurs:
• With each new lot of reagents (Reagent Integral or Starter Reagents).
• The previous calibration was performed more than 8 weeks prior.
• Quality Control results are out of the acceptable range.
• The Analyzer has been serviced.
Refer to the analyzer operator’s manual for calibration instructions.
Measuring range: The LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus assay measures between 0.01
and 10 Index units.
The lowest reportable value is 0.01 Index unit. Values below 0.01 Index units should be
reported as < 0.01 Index units. The highest reportable value without dilution is 10 Index
units.
5. Quality Control:
Quality control is required to be performed once per day of use, or according to the
guidelines or requirements of local regulations or accredited organizations. It is
recommended that the user refer to CLSI C24-A3 and 42 CFR 493.1256 (c) for guidance on
appropriate quality control practices.
LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus controls are intended to monitor for substantial reagent
failure. Single replicates of LIAISON controls should be run to monitor the assay
performance. If control values lie within the expected ranges provided on the certificate of
analysis, the test is valid. If control values lie outside the expected ranges, the test is invalid
and patient results cannot be reported. Assay calibration should be performed if a control
failure is observed and controls and patient specimens must be repeated.
The performance of other controls should be evaluated for compatibility with this assay
before they are used. Appropriate value ranges should be established for all quality control
materials used.
The range of concentrations of each control is reported on the certificate of analysis and
indicates the limits established by DiaSorin for control values that can be obtained in reliable
assay runs.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The cut-off for the LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus assay was determined by evaluating
U.S. sourced characterized samples from Lyme disease patients and routine clinical samples
sent to the laboratory for Lyme disease serology testing. Based on available clinical and
laboratory data and by comparison with other cleared serology assays, the samples were
classified as expected positive or negative for B. burgdorferi antibodies and evaluated with
the LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus assay. An Index of 1.0 was determined to provide
the best balance of sensitivity and specificity for the tested samples. An equivocal zone of
0.90 -1.10 was applied to the assay to account for normal measurement imprecision.

were de-identified and tested. The collection consisted of subjects from five geographical
regions of the U.S. The samples were tested with the LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus
assay on the LIASON XL and performed in three laboratories (two external and one
internal at DiaSorin). Results were evaluated for first-tier testing.

Analytical Specificity: The LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus assay was used to test 300
samples from apparently healthy individuals in the U.S. This population was 55.3% female,
44.7% male with a mean age of 59 years. Fifty percent of the samples were collected in a
Lyme disease endemic region and 50% were collected from a Lyme disease non-endemic
region.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Internal and external investigators assessed the device’s performance with 1550 masked
specimens prospectively collected from patients between the ages of 4 and 103 that were
submitted for Borrelia antibody testing. Specimens were acquired from five distinct
geographical regions within the U.S. The specimens were randomly distributed among three
testing sites, one of which was the manufacturer’s research facility for testing. The device’s
performance was also assessed at the manufacturer’s research facility with specimens from an
asymptomatic population obtained from both endemic and non-endemic regions. Available
subject demographics, quantity of specimens tested and number of specimens which tested
positive or equivocal for each population are summarized in Table 10.
