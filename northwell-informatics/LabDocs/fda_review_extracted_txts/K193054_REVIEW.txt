IV. Device/System Characteristics:
A. Device Description:
Sectra Digital Pathology Module (version 2.2) is a software-only device for viewing and
manipulating digital pathology images of glass slides obtained from the Aperio AT2 DX scanner
on the Dell MR2416 monitor. Sectra Digital Pathology Module may only be used in combination
with Sectra Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), which consists of Sectra
Workstation IDS7 and Sectra Core. Sectra Digital Pathology Module consists of four elements:
Pathology Image Window (PIW), Sectra Pathology Server (SPS), Database Engine (SPDB), and
Sectra Pathology Import Server (SPIS). The PIW is a web application embedded in Sectra
Workstation IDS7 for end users to view and manipulate digital pathology images. The SPS is the
main server component for the PIW client. The SPDB stores the metadata required for the SPS.
The SPIS is used for importing digital pathology images from the Aperio AT2 DX scanner.
The subject device is operated as follows:
1. The image acquisition is performed using the predicate device, Aperio AT2 DX scanner.
The operator performs quality control of the digital slides using ImageScope DX and Dell
MR2416 per the instructions of Aperio AT2 DX to determine if re-scans are necessary.
2. The digital slides are imported by SPIS and automatically assembled as groups of cases.
The unaltered images are then sent to the external storage Sectra Core. Sectra Core offers
an application programming interface allowing communication between the Sectra
Healthcare Server (SHS), which is part of Sectra Core, and the SPS, which is part of the
subject device. The image metadata (e.g. pixel size) is stored locally in the SPDB to
improve operational performance.
3. The laboratory technician performs a quality control by using PIW to verify that all
images have been imported.
K193054 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
4. The reading pathologist selects a case (patient) from a worklist external to the subject
device such as the laboratory information system (LIS) whereby the SPS fetches the
associated images from the Sectra Core.
5. The reading pathologist uses the subject device to view the images and is able to perform
the following actions, as needed:
a. Zoom and pan the image
b. Adjust focus (when different focus depths are available)
c. Measure distances and areas in the image
d. Annotate images
e. Choose to view multiple images side by side in a synchronized fashion
After viewing all images belonging to a particular case (patient), the pathologist will make a
diagnosis. The diagnosis is documented in another system such as the LIS.

a. Pixel-wise comparison with the predicate device including zooming and panning
operations across multiple tiles and vertical/horizontal stitching seams
The equivalence between the subject and predicate image review manipulation software
(IRMS, as defined in the FDA guidance titled “Guidance for Industry “Technical
Performance Assessment of Digital Pathology Whole Slide Imaging Devices", dated
April 20, 2016 [TPA guidance, IV(A)(9)] was supported by bench testing data based on
pixel-level comparison. The subject IRMS was tested as operating with the intended
components, including the scanner, image management system and display. The scanner
color profile embedded in the whole slide image (WSI) file as well as the display color
profile associated with the intended display were included in the tests. WSI files from 30
FFPE tissue glass slides from different anatomic locations that were H&E stained were
used as the test input. For each region of interest (ROI), the differences between the
views generated by the subject and predicate IRMS were evaluated with the 1976
International Commission on Illumination (CIE) color difference metric ΔE for each
corresponding pixel pair. The two views generated by the subject and predicate IRMS
were adjusted and registered by using only the graphical user interface without image
processing. The test cases of ROIs included relevant biological features at different
magnification levels such as 20x and 40x. Horizontal/vertical stitching seams between the
tiles were included in the ROIs when possible. For each ROI, zooming to an odd
magnification level and panning across multiple tiles that require interpolated rendering
were also tested. The average color difference of all pixels within each ROI was reported.
The image data of all ROIs were also provided for verification. The test results
demonstrated that the 99th percentile of the difference is below 2.06 ΔE. The subject
device has been found to adequately reproduce digital pathology images at the pixel level
with respect to its intended use.
b. Turnaround Time for the image to be fully loaded while opening a slide from a medical
device data system (MDDS) and for panning/zooming
Comparison with predicate device: The predicate device ImageScopeDX has the
following reported turnaround times: “should not take longer than 7 secs till the image is
fully loaded while opening a slide from a MDDS." and "Panning on the image should not
take longer than 0.5 sec in order to load and show all image data.” The turnaround times
for opening an image and panning have been measured in the subject device. The results
are similar to that of the predicate device ImageScopeDX.
Turnaround time zooming and panning: Long-time running performance test simulating
normal usage: A long-time running client test simulating normal end user behavior,
measuring performance and executing for at least 6 hours. This test showed no signs of
any memory leak or performance issues. The subject device has been found to have an
acceptable turnaround time with respect to its intended use.
c. Measurements – area and distance
Measurement accuracy has been verified using a test image containing objects of
known sizes. The following set of tests were used to validate the measurement accuracy
of the subject device.
Comparison with predicate device: The same measurements are performed using the
subject device and using the Predicate device ImageScopeDX. The results are verified to
correspond.
K193054 - Page 9 of 10

--- Page 10 ---
Measurements verified using calibration slide with known distances: An image of a
calibration slide with known distances was used to verify the measurement accuracy of
the subject device. Test results showed that the subject device performed accurate
measurements with respect to its intended use.
d. Human Factors Testing
Human factors study designed around critical user tasks and use scenarios performed by
representative users were conducted. A systematic evaluation of task-based usability
including critical tasks required for operation of the device were evaluated at multiple
sites using multiple users. All tasks associated with reviewing and reporting results for
cases including confirmation that all slides belonging to specific cases are reviewed
before reporting results, were included in the study. After having completed all the tasks,
all the participants were asked a set of overall satisfaction questions followed by the
System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire. Overall, the results of the human factors
testing were acceptable.
VIII. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
