messages on all software versions. As part of an initial corrective action, BEC developed a
software patch that contains an additional criterion to an existing algorithm flag in the software,
alerting the user of a suspect PLT finding and to review the result.
The modification is an update to the DxH 800 software to version 3.9.0 which contains the
following changes: 1) The addition of a criteria to an existing rule to detect erroneously elevated
platelet results caused by sweep flow obstructions; 2) disable the Clear RBC Aperture update; 3)
strengthen cybersecurity, and; 4) the addition of an automated VCSn optimization feature.
Note that although the DxH 800 is the subject of this Traditional 510(k), the changes described
for software version 3.9.0 will also be applicable to the DxH 600 (software version 1.9.0) and
DxH 900 (software version 1.1.1). The DxH 600, CLIA categorized under document CR140130,
and the DxH 900, CLIA categorized under document CR180382, are both currently marketed as
members of the instrument family of the DxH 800 hematology analyzers in accordance with
FDA’s Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family
Policy.

The Unicel DxH 800 Coulter Cellular Analysis System with Early Sepsis Indicator Application
is the quantitative measurement of Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW). The Early Sepsis
Indicator is intended for use with adult patients presenting to the emergency department, on
whom a white cell differential test has been ordered.
MDW is measured from a (K2EDTA) whole-blood venous sample within 2 hours of collection.
MDW values greater than 20.0 together with other laboratory findings and clinical information,
aids in identifying patients with sepsis or at increased risk of developing sepsis within the first 12
hours of hospital admission.
MDW values greater than 20.0 should be interpreted in association with other clinical
information and diagnostic testing, as a proportion of patients without sepsis may have an
elevated MDW value at baseline.
MDW values less than or equal to 20.0 cannot rule out sepsis or the development of sepsis within
12 hours of hospital admission. The Early Sepsis Indicator should not be used as the sole basis to
determine the absence of sepsis.
The predictive value of the Early Sepsis Indicator for identifying sepsis in patients with
hematological abnormalities has not been established.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The UniCel DxH 800 System contains an automated hematology analyzer (DxH 800) designed
for in vitro diagnostic use in screening patient populations by clinical laboratories. The system
provides a Complete Blood Count (CBC), Leukocyte 5-Part Differential (Diff), Reticulocyte
K193124 - Page 3 of 21

--- Page 4 ---
(Retic), Nucleated Red Blood Cell (NRBC) on whole blood, as well as, Total Nucleated Count
(TNC), and Red Cell Count (RBC) on Body Fluids (cerebrospinal, serous and synovial) and
Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW). This parameter has been shown to aid in the early
detection of Sepsis in emergency room patients.
The system consists of two primary components, the workstation and the DxH 800 analyzer, the
primary function of which is to process samples and provide results to the workstation. The
primary functions of the workstation are: user interface, system control, results processing and
storage and external communications.
The version of the system proposed in this submission is DxH800 v3.9.0. This system is an
update to DxH800 v3.8.0 (see K181599) to: add an automated VCSn optimization feature, which
is a software change to verify the Latron CP-X control (beads) recovers within the limits and
optimize the calibration factor of the VCSn module; improve cybersecurity; include additional
criteria for a flag, and; disable the Clear RBC Apertures function.
B Principle of Operation:
The Coulter Principle of automated cell counting and sizing is used in the analysis of the whole
blood and body fluid specimens. Each cell suspended in a conductive liquid (diluent) acts as an
insulator. As each cell goes through the aperture, it momentarily increases the resistance of the
electrical path between two submerged electrodes on either side of the aperture. This causes a
measurable electronic pulse. While the number of pulses indicates particle count, the amplitude
of the electrical pulse is proportional to the cell volume. These pulses are sent to the Signal
Conditioner for analog to digital conversion. Pulse counts and digitized pulse measurements are
sent to the System Manager for processing by the algorithms where the reported parameter
values, flags and histograms are generated.
The lytic reagent used for the white cell count prepares the blood so the system can count
leukocytes and measure the amount of hemoglobin. The lytic reagent rapidly and simultaneously
destroys the erythrocytes and converts a substantial proportion of the hemoglobin to a stable
pigment while it leaves leukocyte nuclei intact. The absorbance of the pigment is directly
proportional to the hemoglobin concentration of the sample.
Hemoglobin is measured photometrically at 525 nm using the sample from the white cell
analysis. Clean diluent is introduced into the cuvette during each operating cycle and is used as a
blank in the calculation of the HGB.
The COULTER® VCSn technology is used to determine the white cell differential, nucleated
red blood cell count and reticulocyte parameters along with associated flags, messages,
histograms and data plots.
The sample preparation and analysis use specific reagents and analytical processes for the WBC
differential, NRBC and Retic analysis. The prepared sample is delivered to the flow cell for
sample detection. As the cells pass through the sensing zone, a diode laser illuminates the
K193124 - Page 4 of 21

--- Page 5 ---
particles causing light scatter and light absorption. Simultaneously to the light scatter
measurements, cell volume and cell conductivity are also measured.
The data collected during each of the analytical processes is transferred to the System Manager
where the digital raw values are processed by the algorithm using mathematical approaches
designed for finding optimal separation between clusters of data. The identified clusters are used
to calculate the frequency of cells within each population, generate parameter values, flags,
histograms and data plots.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision (Sample Repeatability) – PLT
The objective of the study was to assess system precision (sample repeatability) for the PLT
parameter on the modified DxH 800 system. The study evaluated the repeatability of whole
blood measurements across the low, normal, and high ranges for the PLT parameter. Studies
were conducted according to CLSI EP05-A3.
Data was generated using the instrument’s repeatability and closed-vial sampling modes.
Fresh whole blood specimens within 8 hours of collection with a minimum of 1 mL volume
remaining were used for this testing. The study was executed with two instruments (DxH 800
(Test A) and DxH 800 (Test B)) at one internal BEC site. Within-run repeatability of the PLT
parameter was performed using 10 aspirations of normal whole blood samples collected in
K2EDTA. Three samples within each range were tested on each instrument. When possible,
additional runs were collected to compensate for flagged runs. With some abnormal blood
samples, where the volume obtained for testing may be less than the required amount to
obtain 10 replicates, a second sample was analyzed for the same parameter and range. One
run was excluded on one instrument for insufficient quantity for one of the three low range
samples. Mean and CV% were reported for each sample automatically from the instrument.
All PLT results met the precision (sample repeatability) specifications. There was no impact
to PLT precision on the DxH 800 from the software design change implementing the
additional criteria for a flag (Change 1) and disabling the Clear RBC Procedure (Change 2).

System Precision (Sample Repeatability) – Change 4
The objective of the study was to assess system precision (sample repeatability) for the
parameters measured directly or derived through histogram on the DxH 800 version 3.9.0
system inclusive of all software design changes (includes the automated VSCn Optimization
(Change 4)). The study evaluated the customer use validation of repeatability as described in
the Instructions for Use (IFU) for whole blood measurements across the low, normal and
high ranges for parameters measured directly or derived through histogram (WBC, RBC,
Hgb, MCV, RDW, RDW-SD, PLT, MPV, LY%, MO%, NE%, EO%, BA%, NRBC,
Reticulocyte %, IRF and MRV). Studies were conducted according to CLSI EP05-A3.
Data was generated using the instrument’s repeatability and closed-vial sampling modes.
Fresh whole blood specimens within 8 hours of collection with a minimum of 1 mL volume
remaining were used for this testing. The study was executed with two instruments (Test A
and Test B) at one internal BEC site. Within-run repeatability of the parameters was
performed using 10 aspirations of normal whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA. A
single sample within each range was tested on each instrument. When sufficient sample
volume existed, the same sample was used across instruments. For MDW, a sample close to
the cut-off (20) was chosen to test the sample repeatability. When possible, additional runs
were collected to compensate for flagged runs. With some abnormal blood samples, where
the volume obtained for testing may be less than the required amount to obtain 10 replicates,

System Precision (Sample Repeatability) – Change 4 with daily shutdown cycles
(additional precision study)
The objective of the study was to assess system precision (sample repeatability) for the
parameters measured directly or derived through histogram on the DxH 800 version 3.9.0
system inclusive of all software design changes (includes the automated VSCn Optimization
(Change 4)). To verify repeatability for all parameters except MDW, three runs with 10
replicates of the same sample were tested, including a Latron CP-X control run for each set.
After each run, the daily shutdown cycle was performed. To verify repeatability for the
MDW parameter, two runs with 10 replicates of the same sample were tested including a
Latron CP-X control run for each set, performed within the 2-hour stability claim. After each
run, the daily shutdown cycle was performed.

Data was generated using the instrument’s repeatability and closed-vial sampling modes.
Fresh whole blood specimen collected within 24 hours were used for this testing. For the
MDW parameter, specimens were processed within 30 minutes of collection. The study was
executed with two instruments at one internal BEC site. For each calibration adjustment
cycle which included the Automated VSCn Optimization change, within-run repeatability
was performed using 10 aspirations of normal whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA
for all parameters except for NRBC where 6C Control Level 2 was used for the 2–15 range
and Retic-X Cell Control Level 3 was used for the Retic 4–15 range.
Three sets of analyses were completed for all parameters except for MDW within 24 hours of
collection. For MDW, two sets of analyses were performed within 2 hours from blood
collection. Each data set is inclusive of one instrument calibration cycle. The instrument
calibration cycle consists of a Shutdown, Startup, Daily Checks and Latron CP-X Control.
The sequence for the three sets of analyses were as follows:
• Shutdown 1, Startup, Daily Checks, Latron CP-X Control 1, Precision Set 1
• Shutdown 2, Startup, Daily Checks, Latron CP-X Control 2, Precision Set 2
• Shutdown 3, Startup, Daily Checks, Latron CP-X Control 3, Precision Set 3
For MDW, two sets of analysis were performed within 2 hours from blood collection
inclusive of two instrument calibration adjustment cycles. The sequence for the two sets of
analyses were as follows:
• Shutdown 1, Startup, Daily Checks, Latron CP-X Control 1, Precision Set 1
• Shutdown 2, Startup, Daily Checks, Latron CP-X Control 2, Precision Set 2
For each repeatability dataset, the mean, SD and CV% were reported for each parameter
where the mean represents the range while SD or CV% the repeatability performance. All
parameters met the precision (sample repeatability) specifications.
2. Linearity:
The objective of the study was to evaluate linearity measurands on the DxH 800 version
3.9.0 system inclusive of the software design changes in accordance with CLSI EP06-A.
Linearity was assessed by demonstrating that the reported results were directly proportional
to the concentration of the measurand in a test sample for the WBC, RBC, Hgb and PLT
parameters. Linearity was performed on three instruments located at a BEC internal testing
site, using one dilution series per measurand to cover the Analytical Measuring Interval
(AMI). Four replicates of each dilution were analyzed in random order. Replicates 2 through
4 were used for the analysis.
Fresh whole blood was obtained and concentrated to achieve high starting values near the
upper limit of the AMI for the RBC and Hgb parameters. WBC and PLT linearity used cell
analogs and media material. Dilutions were prepared to cover the AMI for each parameter
and analyzed in quadruplicate in random order. There were four WBC results exclusions (3
partial aspirations and 1 with an “R” flag).
Data were analyzed including all dilution points for each parameter. Linearity was evaluated
by fitting linear and non-linear (quadratic and cubic) models and assessing that the deviations
K193124 - Page 15 of 21

--- Page 16 ---
from linearity (difference between the non-linear and linear fits) were within acceptance
criteria. WBC, RBC, Hgb, and PLT parameters met the linearity specifications.

9. Carry-Over:
The objective of the study was to evaluate specimen carryover on the DxH 800 version 3.9.0
system inclusive of the software design changes. The study assessed the impact of a
specimen with high target value (HTV) preceding a low target value sample (LTV).
Carryover was evaluated in accordance with CLSI H26-A2.
Testing was performed on three instruments, at an internal BEC site, using the instrument’s
carryover mode, in closed vial sampling mode and used whole blood specimens. Testing was
performed for high WBC, RBC, Hgb, and PLT. Low target value samples (LTV) were
diluted (a small amount of whole blood was added to particle-free plasma) to achieve the
desired range. All samples were concentrated to achieve the high target values (HTV) for
WBC, RBC, PLT and HGB. In addition, analogs were used to achieve WBC HTV > 300.
The target number for each measurand was three sets for each parameter on all three
instruments to assure the minimum number was achieved. The same donor was used across
all three instruments. Different donors were used for each parameter.
Carryover was calculated as follows:
% carryover = [(LTV 1-LTV 3)/( HTV 3-LTV 3)] X100,
Where HTV is the high whole blood specimen and LTV is the low whole blood specimen.
K193124 - Page 16 of 21

--- Page 17 ---
The carryover by parameter for each system was calculated. All carryover testing (by sample
and overall) for WBC, RBC, Hgb and PLT passed. The WBC and RBC carryover testing
were <0.5%, meeting the acceptance limit. PLT and Hgb also met the requirement of
carryover. Carryover specifications were not impacted by the DxH 800 version 3.9.0
software design changes.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method Comparison (Change 1 & Change 2)
The objective of the study was to support substantial equivalence by comparison of the PLT
values obtained on the DxH 800 system version 3.9.0, including the additional criteria for a
flag (Change 1) and the disabled Clear RBC Procedure (Change 2), to the values obtained on
the predicate device, DxH 800 version 3.0.0 (K140911). The predicate device software does
not include the additional criteria for a flag nor the clear RBC procedure.
A total of 127 whole blood specimens (27 normal, 100 clinical) collected in K2EDTA were
included in the study. Specimens were less than 24 hours old from the time of draw and were
targeted to cover the AMI for the PLT parameter. The CBC calibration of instruments was
verified prior to the start of testing and each day that testing occurred. Verification was met
and no adjustments made to the calibration of any instrument. The measurement procedure
comparison paired study design was performed with two test systems (Test A and Test B)
and one predicate system at one site with varying clinical samples.
Basic summary statistics and Bland-Altman plots were calculated for PLT. The Weighted
Deming approach was used to estimate PLT regression. Weighted Deming approach was
used for PLT because the variability (scatter) of the data depended on the range of
measurements. Regression analysis was performed using replicate 1 of the test vs. replicate 1
of the comparator. Bias between methods was calculated from the regression line at the 25th,
50th, and 75th percentile of the range and at medical decision points. Confidence limits were
calculated based on standard errors and 95% confidence. The upper/lower confidence limits
were compared to the Acceptance Limits.

Method Comparison (Change 4)
The objective of the study was to support substantial equivalence of the DxH 800 system version
3.9.0 (automated VSCn Optimization - Change 4) to the predicate device, DxH 800 version 3.8.0
(K181599) by comparing parameters measured directly or derived through histogram.
A total of 224 whole blood specimens (40 normal, 184 clinical) collected in a K2EDTA were
included in this study covering the AMI for the parameters measured. The CBC calibration of
instruments was verified prior to the start of testing and each day that testing occurred.
Verification was met and no adjustments were made to the calibration of any instrument. The
measurement procedure comparison paired study design was performed with two test systems
(Test A and Test B) and one predicate system at one site with varying clinical samples.
Basic summary statistics and Bland-Altman plots were calculated for each parameter. The

and 75th percentile of the range and at medical decision points. Confidence limits were calculated
based on standard errors and 95% confidence. The upper/lower confidence limits were compared
to the instrument accuracy claim. Estimated biases and their 95% confidence limits for the 25th,
50th, and 75th percentiles and medical decision levels were calculated for each test instrument
against the same comparator.

Measurement Procedure Comparison to Predicate device (DxH 800 v 3.8) for MDW
– Change 4
The objective of the study was to support substantial equivalence by comparison of the MDW
values obtained on the DxH 800 system version 3.9.0, (automated VSCn Optimization (Change
4)) to the values obtained on the predicate device, DxH 800 version 3.8.0 (K181599).
A total of 107 whole blood specimens (18 normal, 89 clinical) collected in in K2EDTA
comprised of normal specimens obtained from the in-house donor program, and clinical
specimens obtained from spent hospital samples, meeting the following criteria:
• Normal: 4 – 24 hours old stored at room temperature
• Abnormal: 4 – 24 hours old. Defined as native samples from ambulatory subjects. Use for
MDW range coverage 20 – 25+
Regression analysis was performed using replicate 1 of the test instrument versus replicate 1 of
the comparator instrument. Basic summary statistics and Bland-Altman plots were calculated.
Deming approach was used to estimate regression parameters. Bias was calculated at 50th
percentile point and cut-off levels when appropriate. Confidence limits were calculated based on
standard errors and 95% confidence. The upper/lower confidence limits were compared to the
Acceptance Limits. The 50th percentile and cut-off levels (near 20) correspond to the cut-off
point for the early detection of Sepsis. MDW comparability results met the specifications.

Retrospective Data Analysis
The objective was to conduct a retrospective data analysis using data obtained during the
investigation to determine the flagging rates of erroneous PLT events before and after the
addition of the flagging criteria. The study involved comparison of erroneously elevated platelet
event rates in pre- and post- release of the additional platelet flagging criteria on the DxH
800/600 software.

Sample runs on 678 DxH 800/600 instruments (connected to BEC via ProService) containing the
platelet flagging criteria software were analyzed. The calculated results and flags from runs on
these instruments were evaluated for the presence of the low-end platelet interference flag (PLT
Inter: Debris) pre- and post- installation of the flagging criteria software. Pre- and Post- software
release event rates were compared to each other and the difference between event rates was
normally distributed and the standardized zscore was calculated.
The retrospective data analysis demonstrated the flagging rate remained statistically unchanged
with or without the addition of the additional platelet flagging criteria.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
