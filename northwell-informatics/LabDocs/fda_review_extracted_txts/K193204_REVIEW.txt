IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor Ⅷ is used for determination of FⅧ activity and contains
the following four components:

Reagent Name (per vial set; each box Description
contains 4 vials sets)
Bovine FX and a fibrin polymerization
Reagent 1 1 x 1.25 mL Frozen
inhibitor, with activators and stabilizers.
Human FIIa, human FIXa, calcium
Reagent 2 1 x 1.25 mL Frozen chloride and phospholipids.
FXa substrate containing EDTA and a
Reagent 3 1 x 1.25 mL Frozen
thrombin inhibitor.
Tris buffer solution containing BSA and a
Diluent Buffer 1 x 7.0 mL Frozen heparin antagonist.
B Principle of Operation:
The CRYOcheck Chromogenic FⅧ is a two-stage factor VIII (FVIII) assay. In the first stage,
patient plasma (containing an unknown amount of functional FⅧ) is diluted with Diluent
Buffer and combined with Reagents 1 and 2, containing Factors IXa and X, thrombin, calcium,
and phospholipids. The FⅧ in the patient's plasma is activated and works in concert with FIXa
to cause the activation of FX to FXa. Following an incubation period to allow activation of FX to
FXa, the second stage of the assay occurs through the addition of the chromogenic FXa Substrate
to this mixture. The FXa, present from the previous step, hydrolyzes the substrate into a peptide
and p-Nitroaniline (pNA). The color produced by the release of pNA is measured
spectrophotometrically at 405 nm and is proportional to the Factor Ⅷ in the sample. FVIII
results are reported in percent activity where 100% FVIII activity is equivalent to 1.0 IU/mL.

Traceability
Three levels of CRYOcheck Reference controls are prepared from human citrated plasma
with three different concentrations of hemostatic parameters. CRYOcheck Reference Control
Normal (K013708) was normal human citrated plasma while CRYOcheck Abnormal 1
Reference Control (K952624) and CRYOcheck Abnormal 2 Reference Control (K952624)
were the citrated human plasma with hemostatic parameters values in the borderline
pathological range 30% to 40% and 5% to 10%, respectively. Calibrator value assignments
are traceable to the WHO International Standard for Factor VIII/VWF (6th IS Factor
VIII/VWF Plasma, 07/316).
Sample stability
Sample stability studies were performed to support the recommended storage and handling
instructions found in the device labeling. Citrated plasma samples were tested after storage in
the following temperature ranges, room temperature (15–25°C) and below -70°C. The study
was performed using one reagent lot of CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor Ⅷ on IL ACL
TOP 300 and IL ACL TOP 700 (K160276) analyzers with four replicate measurements at
each time point for each sample. The study data demonstrate that citrated plasma samples are
stable for two hours when stored at room temperature (15–25°C), three months when stored
at <-70°C, including up to two freeze thaw cycles.
5. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) for the
test system was determined following the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Each study design
included three reagent lots and one representative instrument model.

The limit of blank (LoB) was determined using four plasma samples obtained from
individuals with severe congenital Hemophilia A. Each sample was tested in three replicates
on five different days on one representative instrument model for n=15 determinations per
reagent lot. The sponsor determined the LoB to be 0.4% FⅧ activity.
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined using four plasma samples obtained from
individuals with congenital Hemophilia A. Each sample was tested in three replicates on five
different days on one representative instrument model for n=15 determinations per reagent
lot. The sponsor determined the LoD to be 0.5% FVIII activity.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined using four plasma samples with low FⅧ
activity at the following target concentrations: 0.4% FVIII, 0.4% FVIII, 0.5% FVIII and
0.5% FVIII. Each of the four plasma samples were tested in three replicates per day on five
different days, for n=15 determinations per reagent lot. The sponsor determined the LoQ to
be 0.5% FⅧ activity.
