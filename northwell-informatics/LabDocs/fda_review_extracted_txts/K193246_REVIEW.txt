IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System is a small automatic blood gas analyzer for
laboratory and point of care setting. It consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges, calibrator
packs, auto-cartridge quality control packs (internal controls), ampuled quality control materials
(external controls) and thermal paper for an onboard printer. Specimens may be identified by
scanning a barcode or by manually entering the information via the touchscreen.
The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges (Primary
and Auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by detecting which
sensor cards are installed. The reporting of CO-Oximeter parameters (or not reporting them) will
also be determined by the selection of the Sensor Cards, for which there are two options:
• Primary Sensor Card 1 reports the following analytes: pO , pCO , pH, Hct, tHb, Na, Cl,
2 2
K, iCa, iMg, Glu, SO , O Hb, COHb, MetHb, HHb, tBil, HbF
2 2
• Primary Sensor Card 2 reports the following analytes: pO , pCO , pH, Hct, tHb, Na, Cl,
2 2
K, iCa, iMg, Glu, SO

B Principle of Operation:
pH: pH is measured using a hydrogen ion selective glass membrane. One side of the glass is in
contact with a solution of constant pH. The other side is in contact with a solution of unknown
pH. A change in potential develops which is proportional to the pH difference of these solutions.
This change in potential is measured against a reference electrode of constant potential. The
magnitude of the potential difference is a measure of the pH of the unknown sample.
pCO : pCO is measured with a modified pH sensor. Carbon dioxide in the sample makes
2 2
contact with a gas permeable membrane mounted on a combination measuring/ reference
electrode. CO diffuses across the membrane into a thin layer of electrolyte solution in response
2
to partial pressure difference. This solution then becomes equilibrated with the external gas
pressure. CO in the solution becomes hydrated producing carbonic acid, which results in a
2
change in hydrogen ion activity, according to the equation:
CO + H O <=> H CO <=> H+ + [HCO –]
2 2 2 3 3
The electrolyte solution behind the membrane is in contact with a glass hydrogen ion selective
sensor. The change in hydrogen ion activity in the electrolyte solution produces a potential which
is measured against the internal filling solution. This change in potential is measured against the
constant potential of the reference electrode half-cell and is logarithmically related to the pCO2
of the unknown sample.
pO : pO is measured amperometrically by the generation of a current at the sensor surface. As
2 2
oxygen diffuses through a gas permeable membrane, the oxygen molecules are reduced at the
cathode, consuming 4 electrons for every molecule of oxygen reduced. This flow of electrons is
then measured by the sensor and is directly proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen in the
sample.

Respiratory Therapy Lab. A total of 61 respiratory care, 12 nursing, and 1 exercise
physiology POC personnel participated from the 3 POC settings over the course of the
studies.
a) Within-Run Precision
Within-run precision of the Stat Profile Plus Analyzer System in the hands of POC operators
was assessed using a combination of three levels of Quality Control (QC) material and two
levels of linearity materials to cover the measuring range for each analyte. Each sample was
analyzed in replicates of 20 using three Stat Profile Plus Analyzer Systems. All three POC
sites produced similar results. Representative within-run precision results from one site are
summarized in the table below:

c) Precision using whole blood samples
A whole blood within-run precision study was performed at three POC sites by two POC
operators using one Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System at each site. Five fresh, native
arterial whole blood samples were analyzed in replicates of ten. Each whole blood specimen
was maintained in a syringe for the duration of the testing. The POC operator performed all
sample analysis steps including sample analysis, removal of resultant air bubble(s) from the
syringe, recapping of the syringe and mixing prior to the next sample analysis. The results
from each site are presented in the tables below.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were conducted at three POC sites - a Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit, an Emergency Department and a Respiratory Therapy Lab. Lithium heparinized
arterial and venous whole blood specimens were analyzed in singlet using three Stat Profile
Prime Plus analyzers (one at each site) by 65 POC staff members (13, 21 and 31 POC staff
members within each testing site, respectively, including a total of 52 respiratory care, 12
nursing, and 1 exercise physiology POC personnel). In order to cover the claimed measuring
range for each analyte, less than 10% of samples for each analyte were altered. The clinical
results obtained by POC staff members were compared to results obtained by trained
healthcare professionals from the same whole blood specimens. Each of the three sites
produced similar method comparison data. Linear regression analysis for venous and arterial
whole blood method comparison for all POC sites combined is presented in the table below.
