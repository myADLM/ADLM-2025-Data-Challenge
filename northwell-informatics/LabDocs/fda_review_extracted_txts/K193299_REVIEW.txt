D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using VITEK 2 Systems 9.02 software or later
versions
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Ceftazidime has the following concentrations in the card: 1, 2, 4,
8 and 32 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The
ceftazidime MIC result range for the VITEK 2 is ≤0.5 to ≥32 μg/mL. For all species, the VITEK
2 system is capable of reporting the following MIC results: ≤0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and ≥32 μg/mL
for the AST-Gram Negative Ceftazidime test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-GN card with Ceftazidime was conducted at
three external clinical sites using a panel of ten Gram-negative bacilli consistent with the
indications for use (i.e., four Pseudomonas aeruginosa, three Enterobacter spp., two Serratia
marcescens and one Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumoniae). Each isolate was tested in
triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. Inocula were prepared using both the
auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2 System. In addition,
inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method for use with the VITEK 2 Compact.
The mode or median of MIC values was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility
was calculated based on the number of MIC values that fell within ±1 doubling dilution of
the mode/median MIC value. The data was analyzed taking into consideration best-case and
worst-case scenarios as described in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. The reproducibility performance is
summarized in Table 2.

1 Does not include the full CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution range for QC testing. For E. coli, an in-
range VITEK result will be ≤ the lowest dilution on the card (i.e., ≤ 0.5 µg/mL).
2 Two replicates of this organism were tested; one result was out of range. Since the results for the other
replicate and the other QC organisms were within the acceptable range, the reference results were
accepted and testing was not repeated. QC results were within the expected range on the next testing day.
Inoculum Density Check:
The DensiCHEK Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a 0.5 McFarland standard.
The instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at each site. Calibration
values were within the expected range.
Purity Check:
A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to prepare the
VITEK 2 card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in the study.
Growth Failure Rate:
A total of 981 clinical isolates were evaluated. A total of 977 organisms grew in the VITEK 2
AST-Gram Negative Ceftazidime test using the auto-dilution method which is acceptable
(<10% growth failure).
A total of 118 challenge isolates were evaluated at one site. All 118 challenge organisms
grew in the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Ceftazidime test using both the auto-dilution and
manual dilution methods for the VITEK 2 and manual dilution method for the VITEK 2
Compact.
A total of four isolates did not grow in the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Ceftazidime test so
complete test results are available for 1095 isolates.

Testing of ceftazidime on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card was performed at three
external sites and one internal site. There were 981 clinical isolates and 118 challenge
isolates tested for a total of 1099 isolates. Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-Gram
Negative card with ceftazidime were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth
microdilution reference panel. The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative
Ceftazidime is ≤0.5 to ≥32 μg/mL for all species. The reference panel contained two-fold
serial dilutions with a range of ≤0.0313 to ≥256 μg/mL. The testing conditions for the
reference method consisted of the following:
• Medium – Cation Adjusted Mueller Hinton broth
• Inoculum – Direct colony suspension
• Incubation – 35°C; 16-20 hours
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test
inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using
the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 981 clinical isolates were evaluated: 67.9% were considered contemporary isolates
(isolated from clinical specimens and tested within six months) and 32.1% were stock
isolates. Four isolates did not grow in the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Ceftazidime test so
complete test results are available for 977 clinical isolates: 968 isolates from indicated
species (25 A. baumannii, 13 A. baumannii complex, 1 A. lwoffii, 1 Acinetobacter spp., 1 C.

VITEK 2 Compact.
At the time of comparative testing, resistant isolates were not available for Citrobacter koseri
and Yersinia enterocolitica. The following statement is included in the Limitations section of
the device labeling:
The ability of the AST card to detect resistant strains with the following combination(s) is
unknown because an insufficient number of resistant strains were available at the time of

When using the auto-dilution method of the VITEK 2, the overall performance of
Acinetobacter spp. is acceptable with an EA of 93.1% and a CA of 89.7%. There were no
major or very major errors. The overall performance with all Enterobacteriaceae is
acceptable with an EA of 97.9% and a CA of 97.7%. There were three major errors (3/559 =
0.5%) and no very major errors. The overall performance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is
acceptable with an EA of 94.6% and a CA of 97.2%. There were three major (3/268 = 1.1%)
and nine (9/155 = 5.8%) very major errors; seven of the nine very major errors had MIC
values of 8 µg/mL. This is addressed as a limitation statement in the device labeling:
The lack of an intermediate category has shown very major discrepancies when
compared to the reference method. Testing should be repeated using an alternative
method prior to reporting results for the following antibiotic/organism combination(s):
Ceftazidime: Pseudomonas aeruginosa when the VITEK 2 MIC is 8 µg/ml.
Due to the lack of an intermediate interpretive criteria for ceftazidime with P. aeruginosa,
further analysis of the errors is performed and adjustments are made by considering the MIC
values where the errors occurred. Two of the three major errors had an MIC value that was
one doubling dilution from the reference and thus in essential agreement. Therefore, the
adjusted number of major errors is reduced to 1 (1/268 = 0.4%). Five of the nine very major
errors had an MIC value that was one doubling dilution from the reference and thus in

essential agreement. Therefore, the adjusted number of very major errors is reduced to four
(4/155 = 2.6%). In addition, seven of the nine very major errors had MIC values of 8 µg/mL.
To describe the very major errors, these results are addressed as a footnote to the
performance table in the device labeling:
The overall categorical very major error rate for ceftazidime when testing Pseudomonas
aeruginosa with the VITEK 2 system was 5.8% (9/155). The MIC values of five of the
nine very major errors were one doubling dilution from the MIC value obtained from the
reference method. Based on the essential agreement and lack of an intermediate
breakpoint for ceftazidime with P. aeruginosa, the adjusted very major error rate for P.
aeruginosa is 2.6% (4/155). Seven of the nine very major errors had MIC values of 8
μg/mL; therefore, alternative testing is required prior to reporting results for P.
aeruginosa when the VITEK 2 MIC value is 8 μg/mL.
Challenge Data –VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Manual Dilution
The 118 challenge isolates were also evaluated at one site with the manual dilution options of
the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems (summarized in Table 5).

When using the manual dilution method of the VITEK 2 and VITEK2 Compact, the overall
performance of all Acinetobacter spp. challenge isolates had an EA and CA of 88.9%. This
performance is less than the 90% performance criteria outlined in the AST Special Controls
guidance document, likely due to the limited number of challenge isolates available for
testing. Of the 18 challenge isolates tested, 8 isolates had MIC values that were not evaluable
for EA. Of the 10 evaluable MIC values, there were no major or very major errors. This is
addressed in the following footnote to the performance table in the device labeling:
A limited number of Acinetobacter isolates were available for testing with the manual
dilution. Of the 18 isolates tested, 8 had MIC values that were not evaluable for essential
agreement. Of the 10 evaluable MIC values, there were 2 minor categorical errors that
were not in essential agreement.

When using the manual dilution method of the VITEK 2 and VITEK2 Compact, the overall
performance of all Enterobacteriaceae challenge isolates is acceptable with an EA of 100%
and a CA of 98.8%. There were no major or very major errors. Overall performance of P.
aeruginosa challenge isolates with either instrument is acceptable with an EA and CA of
100%. There were no major or very major errors.
Resistance Mechanism Characterization
Challenge isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa harboring various molecular
mechanisms of resistance noted in the FDA drug label were tested with ceftazidime. The
following resistance mechanisms were evaluated: β-lactamases (OXA, SHV, TEM, AMPC
and others).
MIC Trends
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method for each indicated organism species and group. This
trending calculation analyzes device MIC values that are determined to be one or more
doubling dilutions lower or higher than the reference method. MIC values that are off-scale
for both the reference and device are not considered in the trending analysis.
Trending results were stratified by species to determine if species-related trends were
observed (Table 6). Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with
higher or lower MIC values was ≥30% with a statistically significant confidence interval
were considered to have evidence of trending.

A trend toward lower MIC values was observed for Yersinia enterocolitica. The following
footnote to the performance table is included in the package insert to address the trending
observed for VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Ceftazidime:
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Ceftazidime values tended to be in exact agreement or at
least one doubling dilution lower when testing Yersinia enterocolitica compared to the
CLSI reference broth microdilution.
As required under 511A(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the
following statement is included in the Precautions section of the device labeling to address
testing and reporting of non-indicated species:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.

aAccording to FDA STIC Website.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GN Ceftazidime when revised breakpoints for
ceftazidime are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the
ceftazidime device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
