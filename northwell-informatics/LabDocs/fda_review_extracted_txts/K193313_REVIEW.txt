IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys Anti-TSHR reagent kit consists of a Reagent Pack (R1, R2, and Microparticles),
lyophilized calibrators 1 and 2, and a Pretreatment Pack (PT1, PT2, PTR, PTB).
The Reagent Pack’s components are:
• M: Streptavidin-coated microparticles (transparent cap), Streptavidin-coated microparticles
(0.72 mg/mL) and preservative in a 6.5 mL-bottle.
• R1: Buffer solution (gray cap), containing 20 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4); stabilizers;
and preservative in a 7 mL-bottle.
• R2: Anti TSHR~Ru(bpy) (black cap), Monoclonal anti-TSHR antibody M22 (human)
labeled with ruthenium complex (approximately 0.3 mg/L) in 20 mmol/L phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4); stabilizers, and preservative in a 7 mL-bottle.
The Pretreatment Pack’s components are:
• PT1: Pretreatment buffer solution (black cap), 20 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4);
stabilizers, and preservative in a 4 mL-bottle.
• PT2: Empty bottle (white cap) for pretreatment reagent (PTR) reconstituted with
pretreatment buffer (PTB).
• PTR: Pretreatment reagent (white cap): lyophilized porcine TSHR-anti-pTSHR-Ab~biotin
complex; 40 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.2); and stabilizers in a 4 mL-bottle.
• PTB: Pretreatment buffer (white cap), reconstitution medium for PTR containing phosphate
buffer 10 mmol/L (pH 7.2) and stabilizer in 5 mL-bottle.
The reformulated reagents are designed to block the interference of free biotin with the anti-
TSHR assay and to improve the binding between the conjugate and the streptavidin-coated
magnetic microparticles. A biotin-binding scavenger antibody was added to the assay to bind
free biotin in the sample. The antibodies are specific only to free biotin and do not bind to, or
interact with, the biotin-linker conjugates. The biotinylated antibody conjugate was modified by
changing the chemical spacer between the biotin molecule and the detection antibody.
Lengthening the distance between the biotin and the immunological component is designed to
improve binding of the conjugate to the streptavidin-coated magnetic bead. No change was
made to the capture and detection antibodies which still recognize the same epitope.

B Principle of Operation:
The Elecsys Anti-TSHR immunoassay is a three-step competitive immunoassay with
streptavidin-coated microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. Patient serum
sample is incubated with pretreatment reagent PT1 and the reconstituted PT2 containing a
pre-formed immunocomplex of solubilized porcine TSH receptor (pTSHR) and biotinylated
anti-pTSHR mouse monoclonal antibody. Anti-TSHR antibodies (TRAb) in patient's sera
interact with the TSHR immunocomplex. After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles
and a human thyroid stimulating monoclonal autoantibody (M22) labeled with a ruthenium
complex, bound TRAb are detected by their ability to inhibit the binding of labeled M22. The
entire complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. The
reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically
captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with
ProCell/ProCell M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent
emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument
by a two-point calibration and master curve provided with the reagent bar code. Test values of
≤1.75 IU/L are negative while test values >1.75 IU/L are positive.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous Interference:
The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2. Three specimens were
tested (around the cut-off, a moderate positive, and a high positive) for each compound
tested. One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering substance, another
aliquot was spiked with the same volume of isotonic NaCl solution to create a dilution pool.
The interferent pool was then diluted into the dilution pool in 10 % increments. The
recovery for each sample was calculated by comparison to the reference (unspiked) sample.
No interference was observed at these concentrations: hemoglobin at ≤400 mg/dL: bilirubin
at ≤ 25 mg/dL; Intralipid at ≤1500 mg/dL; and Rheumatoid Factor at ≤600 IU/mL.
Exogenous Interference:
The effect on quantitation of TSH in the presence of drugs was determined by comparing
values obtained from samples spiked with 17 commonly and 13 specialty pharmaceutical
compounds with the reference sample (unspiked). The drug concentrations tested correspond
at least to the three times maximum daily doses (or the one-time maximum daily dose,
respectively). Drug interferences are measured based on recommendations given in CLSI
guidelines EP7-ED3 and EP37-ED1 and other published literature.
Two human serum samples (native serum pools) with analyte concentration approximately 3
and 30 IU/L were divided into aliquots and spiked with the potential interferences. The
reference sample, without interferent, was spiked with the respective amount of solvent only
and tested on the cobas e 601.
Each of the 17 commonly used drugs was found to be non-interfering at the listed
concentration: Acetaminophen at 156 mg/L; N-Acetylcysteine at 553 mg/L; Acetylsalicylic
Acid at 1000 mg/L; Ampicillin-Na at 1000 mg/L; Ascorbic acid at 300 mg/L; Cefoxitin at
2500 mg/L; Cyclosporine at 1.8 mg/L; Doxycycline at 50 mg/L; Sodium Heparin at 50 IU/L;
Ibuprofen at 500 mg/L; Itraconazole at 30 mg/L; Levodopa at 20 mg/L; Methyldopa +1,5 at
22.5 mg/L; Metronidazole at 200 mg/L; Phenylbutazone at 321 mg/L; Rifampicin at 60
mg/L; and Theophylline at 60 mg/L.
Sodium Heparin was found to interfere at concentrations >50 IU/L. A limitation stating: “Do
not use samples from patients under sodium heparin treatment. Sodium heparin showed no
interference up to a concentration of 50 IU/L.” was added to the package insert.
Each of the 13 specialty drugs was found to be non-interfering at the listed concentration:
Amiodarone at 200 mg/L; Carbimazole at 30 mg/L; Fluocortolone at 20 mg/L;
Hydrocortisone at 200 mg/L; Iodide at 0.040 mg/L; Levothyroxine at 0.250 mg/L;
Liothyronine at 0.015 mg/L; Thiamazole at 16 mg/L; Octreotide at 0.300 mg/L; Perchlorate
at 400 mg/L; Prednisolone at 20 mg/L; Propranolol at 240 mg/L; and Propylthiouracil at 60
mg/L.

Cross-reacting Substances:
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of potential cross-reacting compounds
using the Elecsys anti-TSHR was determined on the cobas e 601 analytical unit using a
native human serum sample pool. For each potential cross-reacting compound a human
serum sample with a low concentration level and an elevated level of anti-TSHR was tested.
Results from these spiked serum samples were matched against the unspiked references and
the % cross-reactivity was calculated. Less than 1% cross reactivity was observed for these
potential cross-reactants and the concentration tested: anti-thyroglobulin (TG) antibodies at
4,000,000 IU/L; anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) at 600,000 IU/L; luteinizing hormone (LH) at
10,000 IU/L; and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) at 10,000 IU/L.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See K080092. The assay’s reportable range is 0.8–40 IU/L (defined by the Limit of
Detection and the maximum of the master curve). Because the %CV of low concentration
samples is high, values below the LoQ should be reported with caution. The package insert
states: “Please note: When reporting values <1.1 IU/L, the client report should be annotated
with the following information. “Values <1.1 IU/L are not reliable as the intermediate
precision CV is > 20%.””
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
This assay is standardized against NIBSC 1st IS 90/672 Standard.

Stability:
Shelf life stability: Accelerated stability testing comparing the current and the updated
(biotin) assay reagent supports the transfer of the shelf-life claim of 18 months to the updated
anti-TSHR assay. Real-time stability testing is ongoing for the updated Elecsys Anti-TSHR,
supporting a shelf-life of 15 months at this time for unopened reagents and pretreatment kit
components stored at 2–8°C.
On-board Reagent Stability: An isochronous study compared unstressed (refrigerated at 2–
8°C) to stressed (20–25°C) reagents and pretreatment components. The study supported the
claim that the reagents can be stored on board for 3 weeks. The study also supported the
claim that: the pretreatment components can be stored for 72 hours if continuously stored
onboard; or for 3 weeks total for up to 7 uses for 8 hours total on the analyzer (20–25°C) and
stored in the refrigerator (2–8°C) when not in use. The sponsor recommends that the
pretreatment bottles (PT2 containing the reconstituted PTR) be stored in the refrigerator
when not in use (at 2–8⸰C).
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank and limit of detection were determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.
The Limit of Blank (LoB) is the 95th percentile value from 60 measurements of analyte-free
samples over several independent series. The limit of blank corresponds to the concentration
below which analyte-free samples are found with a probability of 95%. The LoB of each
assay was determined by assaying five analyte-free samples in duplicate per sample over six
days for each lot. A total of 60 data points per sample per lot; three lots were tested. The
LoB for each lot was calculated separately. The LoB was determined as 0.5 IU/mL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) is determined based on the limit of blank and the standard
deviation of low concentration samples. The limit of detection corresponds to the lowest
analyte concentration which can be detected (value above the limit of blank with a
probability of 95%). The LoD of each assay was determined by assaying five low analyte
samples in duplicate per sample over six days for each lot. A total of 60 data points per lot
were generated and three lots were tested. The LoD for each lot was calculated separately.
The LoD was determined as 0.8 IU/mL.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was defined as the lowest analyte concentration which can
be quantified with a total error of ≤ 20%. The LoQ was determined by assaying nine low
concentration anti-TSHR native samples tested in replicates of five, one run per day, for five
days (25 replicates per sample) on three reagent lots. The LoQ was calculated by
determining the lowest analyte concentration that resulted in a total within laboratory CV
<20%. The LoQ was 1.1 IU/mL.
Because the %CV of low concentration samples is high, values below the LoQ should be
reported with caution. The package insert states: “Please note: When reporting values <1.1
IU/L, the client report should be annotated with the following information. “Values <1.1
IU/L are not reliable as the intermediate precision CV is >20%.””
7. Assay Cut-Off:
See K080092. Test values of ≤1.75 IU/L are negative while test values >1.75 IU/L are
positive.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The sponsor conducted a method comparison of the Elecsys Anti-TSHR updated assay
(candidate device) and the current Elecsys Anti-TSHR immunoassay (predicate device
K080092). A total of 260 clinical samples from the intended use population were measured
with both assays in singleton on the cobas e 601 analyzer covering the entire measuring
range. The tested group was 198 samples from patients diagnosed with Graves’ disease and
62 samples from patients diagnosed with other thyroid issues (e.g., Hashimoto’s disease,
non-toxic goiter, thyroid carcinoma, etc.). Separate quantitative and qualitative analyses of
the data set were performed:
Because the assay is quantitative, a Passing-Bablok regression analysis of 120 samples
within the measuring range was performed. The samples were tested once with both assays.
Parameter Result
Range (IU/L) 0.800–35.7 IU/L (Predicate Assay, X)
0.917–40.0 IU/L (Candidate Assay, Y)
Slope 1.047
(95th CI) (1.029–1.064)
Intercept -0.068
(95th CI) (-0.188–0.032)
Correlation Coefficient 0.998
Absolute Bias at 1.75 IU/L 0.014
(95th CI) (-0.085–0.095)
Percent Bias at 1.75 IU/L 0.80
The agreement between the assays was calculated using the results of all samples tested in
the study (n=260):
Predicate Assay
Positive Negative Total
Positive 148 5 153
Candidate
Negative 4 103 107
Assay
Total 152 108 260
Positive percent agreement: 97.37% (148/152) 95% CI: 93.43%–98.97%
Negative percent agreement: 95.37% (103/108) 95% CI: 89.62%–98.01%
2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison is not needed because serum is the only matrix indicated.
