III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Distinct® Early Detection Pregnancy Test is an aid for the early detection of pregnancy
intended for home use. The device is a chromatographic immunoassay that performs qualitative
detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. This test can help determine
pregnancy as early as 6 days before the day of the missed period (5 days before the day of the
expected period)
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Distinct® Early Detection Pregnancy Test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for in
vitro qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin in urine to aid in the early detection
of pregnancy. It is for self-testing. The test strip and absorbent tip are assembled in a plastic
housing.
B Principle of Operation:
The test strip contains monoclonal anti-hCG antibodies and goat anti-mouse polyclonal
antibodies. The test result is shown in the result window and read visually after 3 minutes of
urine application.
A blue sign of plus (+) at the test window indicates that hCG has been detected (pregnant).
Absence of the plus (+) and only a blue line (-) in the Test Window suggests no hCG has been
detected. To serve as a procedural control, a blue line will always appear in the Control Window
indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

The sponsor also performed a study to evaluate the imprecision of the device using both
formats when read by laypersons.
Thirty negative urine specimens were collected and spiked with WHO 5th International hCG
standard to the following concentrations: 3, 5, 6, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 10, 12, 15 and 25 mIU/ml. The
samples were blinded and randomized prior to being read. A total of 300 lay users
performed the test using three lots of the devices; however, the total number of readings was

Effects of Urine pH
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the effect of urine pH on the results. A negative
urine pool was split and separately adjusted in pH increments of 1.0 from pH 4.0 to 9.0.
Aliquots of each pH adjusted urine sample were then spiked with hCG to concentrations of 3
and 10 mIU/mL and read at 3 and 10 minutes. There were no deviations from the expected
positive or negative results.
Specific Gravity
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the effect of urine specific gravity on the results.
A negative urine pool was split and adjusted with sodium chloride or purified water to
produce samples with a specific gravity ranging from 1.003 – 1.035. Aliquots of each
specific gravity adjusted urine sample were then spiked with hCG to concentrations of 3 and
10 mIU/mL and read at 3 and 10 minutes. There were no deviations from the expected
positive or negative results.
High Dose Hook Effect Study
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate whether very high concentrations of hCG could
produce a hook effect with the candidate device. Samples were prepared by spiking a
negative urine pool with hCG to concentrations of 500, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 500,000 and
1,000,000 mIU/mL. Sample were tested in triplicate using three lots of the device. All
concentrations of hCG with all three lots produced the expected positive results and no hook
effect was observed.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The test is calibrated against the WHO 5th International Standard (IS) for Chorionic
Gonadotrophin (hCG).
Stability:
The shelf life of the Distinct® Early Detection Pregnancy Test were verified by accelerated,
open pouch and on-going real-time stability studies. From the results of the study, it was
concluded that Distinct® Early Detection Pregnancy Test is stable at 55℃ for 10 weeks and
45℃ for 22 weeks which support the shelf life up to 24 months at 2 – 30o C (36 – 86o F).
6. Detection Limit:
See section VII.A.1 above.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The claimed cutoff of the assay is 10 mIU/mL. See section VII.A.1 above for performance
around the cutoff.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The sponsor performed a combined lay user and method comparison study to evaluate the
accuracy of the candidate device. A total of 205 volunteer participants (lay users) were
recruited at three clinical sites with 68 or 69 participants at each clinical site. Laypersons
tested their own urine samples using the Distinct® Early Pregnancy Test followed the
directions in the package insert. Approximately half of the subjects used the dip method and
half used the midstream method. Trained laboratory professionals then tested the same urine
samples using the candidate device and the predicate device. The samples were blind labeled
before being given to the laboratory professionals for testing. Three lots of the candidate
device were used in the study and the results are summarized below:

including ease of use, clarity and readability of the package insert. All of the participants
reported that the test instructions were easy to follow and that it was easy to read the test
results.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Detection of hCG in Early Pregnancy Clinical Samples
Urine from 65 non-pregnant women expecting to become pregnant were collected daily
starting 8 days prior to their expected period through the date of their expected menstrual
period (EMP), as well as the 6th or 7th day after their EMP. Each patient collected her own
urine and sent the sample to a clinical site where they were tested by a laboratory
professional. Three lots of the candidate device were used and the pregnancy status was
confirmed by ultrasound or a quantitative blood hCG result.
