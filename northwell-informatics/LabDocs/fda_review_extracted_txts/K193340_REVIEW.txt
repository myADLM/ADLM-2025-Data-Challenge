IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
GoChek/GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a glucose meter
(GoChek or GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Meter), GoChek Blood Glucose Test Strips (sold in
vials of test strips and individually wrapped pouches of test strips; sold separately), carrying
case, lancing device, batteries, and two levels of control solution (sold separately). The only
difference between the GoChek and GoChek Connect meters is that the GoChek Connect meter
has Bluetooth connectivity enabled.
B Principle of Operation:
The GoChek and GoChek Connect Blood Glucose meters measure the glucose concentration in
capillary whole blood. Blood is applied to the end tip of the test strip. The blood is then
automatically absorbed into the reaction cell. The reaction takes place in the reaction cell. The
enzyme used is a Flavin-Adenine-Dinucleotide-Dependent Glucose Dehydrogenase (FAD-
GDH). FAD-GDH oxidizes glucose to gluconolactone (GDL) and a transient electrical current is
formed during the reaction which is detected by the meter. The blood glucose concentration is
then calculated based on the electrical current. The result is then shown on the meter display in
mg/dL for the user. The meters are calibrated to display plasma equivalent results.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
Unless otherwise noted, the analytical studies detailed below were performed with the GoChek
Blood Glucose Monitoring System, which is identical to the GoChek Connect Blood Glucose
Monitoring System with the exception of the presence of Bluetooth in the GoChek Connect
System. Therefore, the analytical studies performed with the GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring
System are representative of the performance for both systems in this 510(k) submission.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Run Precision
The sponsor performed a repeatability study (within day) precision study using venous whole
blood adjusted to five different glucose concentration ranges (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-
250, and 251-400 mg/dL). Each glucose concentration was analyzed in replicates of 10 with
three test strips lots, and 10 meters, for a total of 100 tests per glucose level. Results are
summarized in the table below:
Glucose Level Average SD CV
1 35.3 1.88 5.3%
2 95.8 2.81 2.9%
3 128.3 3.74 2.9%
4 221.4 6.31 2.8%
5 382.9 10.05 2.6%
Intermediate Precision
Intermediate (day-to-day) precision was performed using five ranges of glucose control
solution concentrations (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, and 251-400 mg/dL). Testing
was performed for 10 days with three test strip lots. For each level, on each day, 10 meters
were used for testing, with one replicate collected per meter for a total of 10 replicates per
day for each control solution level, for a total of 100 tests per control solution level. Results
are summarized below:
Glucose Level Average SD CV
1 37.5 1.61 4.3%
2 77.5 2.27 2.9%
3 128.0 3.01 2.4%
4 193.0 3.71 1.9%
5 346.7 7.07 2.0%
2. Linearity:
Linearity testing was evaluated with test strips from three lots and 11 mixed pools of venous
whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of 7.5, 25.2, 43.7, 72.6, 95.5, 152.5, 199.5,
252.0, 300.0, 405.5, 511.5, and 578.0 mg/dL as measured with the YSI Model 2300 STAT

PLUS glucose analyzer. Each level was measured in replicates of four and the values
obtained on the GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System were compared to the
comparator. Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the following:
Lot Slope y-intercept R2
1 0.9960 -4.4024 0.9997
2 0.9743 -0.9445 0.9997
3 0.9949 -3.1076 0.9996
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 10 – 580
mg/dL. If a sample is less than 10 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as LO. If the
result is greater than 580 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as HI. This low and high
functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference testing was conducted using venous whole blood adjusted to a hematocrit of
42% ± 2% and glucose was adjusted to the following levels: 50 – 70 mg/dL, 110 – 130
mg/dL and 250 – 270 mg/dL. Control blood samples were prepared by adding solvent with
no interferant. Control and test samples were measured using 10 strips on each of 2 meters
using 3 strip lots. The highest tested concentrations at which no significant interference was
observed (defined by the sponsor as average % bias < ± 10%) are presented in the following

Lay-user Performance study:
To assess the performance of the GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the
hands of the intended users, the sponsor performed studies with 360 English speaking
participants. The participants were responsible for obtaining their own fingertip capillary
sample and performing a blood glucose test using only the instructions from the product
labeling. A total of 360 meters and 20 test strip vials, each containing 25 test strips, from 3
test strip lots were used. The glucose concentrations across all samples ranged from 42.2 to
420.1 mg/dL, which includes 34 native samples < 80 mg/dL and 37 samples > 250 mg/dL as
measured by the comparator method. Results were analyzed by comparing the blood glucose
results obtained by the lay users with the GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring
System against results obtained with a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI Model
2300 STAT PLUS glucose analyzer). The glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from
42.2-420.1 mg/dL, as measured by the YSI Model 2300 STAT PLUS glucose analyzer.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Altitude Study
To evaluate the effect of altitude on the GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System, a
study was conducted using venous whole blood samples adjusted with four concentration
levels of glucose ranging from 40-500 mg/dL. Samples were tested at two different
altitude conditions at sea level (65 feet) and 11,410 feet. Blood samples were tested
using 10 test strips at each altitude condition for each glucose concentration. Eighty test
strips from 3 lots were used. The results obtained on the candidate device were compared
with the results obtained with the comparator method, YSI 2300 STAT PLUS glucose
analyzer. The results demonstrated acceptable bias to the comparator to support the
claim in the labeling that glucose measurement performance of the GoChek Blood
Glucose Monitoring System is maintained at altitudes up to 10,000 feet.
2. Hematocrit
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System,
venous blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%,
35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%. Each hematocrit level was adjusted to
achieve five glucose concentration ranges (30-50 mg/dL, 51-110 mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL,
151-250 mg/dL, and 251-400 mg/dL). Blood samples were tested using the GoChek
meter with test strips from three lots and the mean glucose values were compared to the
results obtained on the comparator method, YSI 2300 STAT PLUS glucose analyzer.
The percent biases relative to the comparator method demonstrated were acceptable to
support the claimed hematocrit range of 10 to 70%.
3. Operating Conditions
The effect of temperature and relative humidity on the GoChek Blood Glucose
Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples adjusted to
approximately four glucose concentration ranges (40-50, 100-120, 250-300, and 500-550
mg/dL). Testing was conducted under the following temperature and relative humidity
(RH) combinations: 5°C at 10% relative humidity (RH), 5°C at 90% RH, 21°C at 10%
RH, 21°C at 90% RH, 21°C at 45% RH, 45°C at 10% RH and 45°C at 90% RH. Test
strips from three lots were used to test the blood samples at each glucose concentration in
10 replicates of 10. Values were compared to results from the comparator method, YSI
2300 STAT PLUS glucose analyzer. The study results support the operating conditions
claim of 41-113°F (5-45°C) with relative humidity of 10% to 90%.
4. Sample volume Study
The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5
μL for the GoChek Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples

with three ranges of glucose concentrations (50-65, 100-120, 200-250 mg/dL) were tested
at five sample volumes (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 μL). Each sample was tested with 10
test strips from 3 lots. Values obtained were compared to the comparator method, YSI
2300 STAT PLUS. The meter has an error message that is displayed if insufficient blood
is added to the test strip. This feature was validated and was shown to function as
intended. The study results support the claimed sample volume of 0.5 μL.
5. Flex Studies
The following additional flex studies were performed with the GoChek Blood Glucose
Monitoring System: sample perturbation, sample outside measuring range, intermittent
sampling, drop, vibration, and shipping testing were completed. The testing performed
demonstrated that the device is robust under these conditions.
6. Infection Control Studies
The two device systems, GoChek and GoChek Connect Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, are intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing
laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the
chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes (EPA Registration # 46781-8). Robustness studies were
also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or
external materials of the meter after 7,665 cleanings and disinfection steps with the
CaviWipes wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 3 years of single-
patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning
and disinfection procedures.
7. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Testing
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and
EMC testing had been performed and the system was found to be compliant.
