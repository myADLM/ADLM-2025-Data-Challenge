The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel also reports the susceptibility for the
following additional organisms as listed on the FDA Susceptibility Test Interpretative Criteria
web site:
Salmonella spp.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The ability of the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative Panels to detect resistance to levofloxacin is
unknown for the following species because an insufficient number of resistant strains were
available at the time of comparative testing: C. koseri, P. vulgaris, and P. agglomerans. Isolates
yielding MIC results suggestive of a resistant interpretive category should be submitted to a
reference laboratory.
Due to the occurrence of very major errors with levofloxacin and the autoSCAN-4 with both
turbidity and Prompt inoculation methods, isolates of P. aeruginosa that provide and MIC of 1
μg/mL should be interpreted manually prior to reporting.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
MicroScan panels can be read either manually or automatically on the WalkAway or autoSCAN-
4 instrument systems.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo panel with levofloxacin is used to determine
the quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of aerobic and facultatively
anaerobic gram-negative bacilli colonies grown on solid media. After inoculation, panels are
incubated for 16-20 hours at 35°C ± 1° in a non-CO incubator and read either visually or with
2
MicroScan instrumentation according to the package insert.
Inoculation methods: Turbidity or Prompt Inoculation System
Read methods: Manual, MicroScan WalkAway System and MicroScan autoSCAN-4
B Principle of Operation:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are dehydrated miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in Mueller Hinton broth
supplemented with calcium and magnesium to concentrations spanning the range of clinical
K193358 - Page 3 of 14

--- Page 4 ---
interest. Breakpoint Combo panels use concentrations equivalent to the categorical breakpoints
identified/recognized by FDA. After inoculation and rehydration with a standardized suspension
of organism and incubation at 35°C for a minimum of 16 hours, the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) for the test organism is determined by observing the lowest antimicrobial
concentration showing inhibition of growth.

3. CLSI M100. Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. 29th ed. (January
2019)
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external sites using 15 isolates of gram-
negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. The range of levofloxacin
dilutions tested was 0.008 - 16 μg/mL. Isolates were tested in triplicate over three days for a
total of 405 data points (27 data points per isolate). The isolates tested in the reproducibility
study included: C. freundii complex (1 isolate), E. cloacae (1 isolates), E. coli (4 isolates), K.
oxytoca (2 isolates), K. pneumoniae (3 isolates), P. aeruginosa (1 isolate), P. mirabilis (1
isolate), S. marcescens (1 isolate), and S. typhi (1 isolate).
Inocula were prepared using both the turbidity and Prompt methods and results were read
manually (visually) and with the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 instrument systems. The
majority of data points were on-scale and the majority were within ± one doubling dilution of
the mode MIC (Table 2). For those read/inoculation combinations that included off-scale
results, reproducibility was assessed as worst-case in addition to best-case.
The reproducibility results are acceptable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Inoculum Density Check. A spectrophotometric device, the MicroScan Turbidity Meter,
was used to ensure the accuracy of the turbidity inoculation method. A zero check of the
turbidity meter was performed daily. The inocula prepared using the turbidity method were
standardized using a reading of 0.08 ± 0.02 (equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland barium sulfate
turbidity standard). The digital reading was recorded for each isolate and was considered
acceptable based on recommendations in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.
Inoculum density data for the Prompt inoculation system was collected from suspensions of
the QC strain E. coli ATCC 25922 and for all reproducibility isolates. Average colony counts
were within the acceptable range for the QC strain and for all reproducibility isolates.
Purity Check. Purity checks were performed on all isolates for each inoculum preparation;
only results from pure cultures were included.
Growth Failure Rate. Less than 10% of isolates demonstrated no growth on the dried test
panel.
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI-recommended QC organisms E. coli ATCC 25922 and
P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were tested with all inoculation and read methods using 12
dilutions of levofloxacin (0.008 – 16 μg/mL). The reference panel was inoculated using the
turbidity method only. For both QC strains, quality control results were within the acceptable
range for all inoculation and read methods. Results of current QC testing are shown in Table
3 below and demonstrate that QC results obtained were in the recommended range >95% of
the time for the reference method and with all inoculation/reading methods for this device.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The results obtained with the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel with
levofloxacin (dilution range 0.008 – 16 μg/mL) were compared to results obtained using a
frozen broth microdilution reference panel (dilution range 0.008 – 16 μg/mL). Clinical
isolates were evaluated at three testing sites in the U.S in a single study; challenge isolates
were evaluated in one separate study performed at one external site.
The reference panel was prepared as described in CLSI document M07-A10 except for the
use of Pluronic-F in the inoculum water for the reference panel. A summary of historical data
from eight previously cleared antimicrobial tests to include ciprofloxacin was provided in the
submission which demonstrated that including the wetting agent did not affect testing. In
addition, the QC testing that was conducted during the clinical study was acceptable.
For the reference method and MicroScan panels inoculated using the turbidity method,
panels were inoculated using the same standardized suspension further diluted into 25 mL of
water with Pluronic-D (for the MicroScan dried panels) or Pluronic-F (for the frozen
reference panels). MicroScan panels were also inoculated using the Prompt inoculation
method with isolates inoculated into the Prompt inoculation bottle. Reference panels were
read manually (visually); MicroScan panels inoculated with both inoculation methods were
read using the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 instruments and by manual read.
Clinical Study
To determine the performance of the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel
with Levofloxacin, a total of 541 Enterobacteriaceae, 19 Salmonella spp., and 79 P.
aeruginosa clinical isolates were evaluated separately based on unique susceptibility test

interpretive criteria with all inoculation and read methods (Tables 4 and 5). The testing
included the following indicated Enterobacteriaceae species: C. freundii (12 isolates), C.
koseri (49 isolates), K. (Enterobacter) aerogenes (32 isolates), E. cloacae (48 isolates), E.
coli (77 isolates), K. oxytoca (47 isolates), K. pneumoniae (89 isolates), M. morganii (41
isolates), P. agglomerans (1 isolate), P. mirabilis (56 isolates), P. vulgaris (17 isolates), P.
rettgeri (19 isolates), P. stuartii (21 isolates), S. marcescens (32 isolates), and Salmonella
spp. (13 non-speciated isolates), and S. enteritidis (6 isolates). An additional 63 isolates of
non-indicated Enterobacteriaceae species (10% of the total number of isolates tested) were
also tested and included in the evaluation. Of all the clinical isolates tested, 462 (65.9%) were
fresh (collected and tested within seven days), 218 (31.0%) were recent (isolated and tested
within six months), and 22 (3.1%) were stock (isolated and tested after six months of
isolation).
Challenge Study
A total of 123 Enterobacteriaceae challenge isolates were evaluated. These included: C.
koseri (3 isolates), K. aerogenes (2 isolates), E. cloacae (8 isolates), E. coli (12 isolates), K.
oxytoca (6 isolates), K. pneumoniae (10 isolates), M. morganii (1 isolate), P. mirabilis (7
isolates), P. rettgeri (1 isolate), S. marcescens (4 isolates), and S. typhi (64 isolates). In
addition, the following non-indicated species were evaluated; C. freundii complex (2
isolates), and S. liquefaciens (3 isolates). A total of 14 challenge isolates of P. aeruginosa
were evaluated.
Results for EA, CA and categorical errors for Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa for all
inoculation and read methods are shown in Tables 4 and 5 below. Essential agreement of
evaluable results was calculated considering MIC results that were clearly identical to
reference method results or clearly ≥ one doubling dilution higher or lower than the reference
method results. Overall results for Enterobacteriaceae and for P. aeruginosa with all
inoculation and read methods were acceptable.
For C. koseri, P. vulgaris, and P. agglomerans, no resistant isolates were available for
evaluation during clinical or challenge testing. The sponsor included the following limitation
in the device labeling:
The ability of the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative Panels to detect resistance to
levofloxacin is unknown for the following species because an insufficient number of
resistant strains were available at the time of comparative testing: C. koseri, P. vulgaris,
and P. agglomerans. Isolates yielding MIC results suggestive of a resistant interpretive
category should be submitted to a reference laboratory.
The overall EA and CA performance for Enterobacteriaceae for the WalkAway, autoSCAN-
4, and manual read methods were acceptable for each inoculation method (Tables 4 and 5).
Testing using the autoSCAN-4 for both inoculation method resulted in two additional very
major errors for P. mirabilis and S. marcescens. However, this was considered acceptable
given that there was only one VME each and a limited number of resistant isolates for these
species. In addition, the sponsor included the following footnote to the performance table in
the device labeling:
One resistant strain of Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens had a single very
major error compared to the reference method when using the autoSCAN-4 instrument
K193358 - Page 8 of 14

--- Page 9 ---
with both turbidity and Prompt inoculation methods.
In addition, one very major error was observed for K. pneumoniae for all read and
inoculation methods resulting in a VME rate of 5.3% (1/19) for this species. As a result, the
sponsor included results from their Assay Development-3 Project which consisted of 24
additional levofloxacin resistant K. pneumoniae strains. Inclusion of these isolates resulted in
an overall VME rate of 2.3% (1/43). Given this, the sponsor was not requested to test
additional isolates. The sponsor included the following footnote in the device labeling:
One resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain resulted in a very major error when
compared to the reference method across all read and inoculation methods.
Salmonella spp. results were evaluated separately from Enterobacteriaceae due to
differences in susceptibility test interpretive criteria. In addition to the 21 isolates that were
tested in this clinical study, the sponsor included results obtained with an additional 62 S.
typhi challenge isolates for a total of 83 Salmonella spp. isolates. The overall EA and CA
performance for this organism were acceptable for each read method and inoculation method
(Tables 4 and 5) and there were no major or very major errors.
The overall EA and CA performance for P. aeruginosa was acceptable for all read and
inoculation methods. Testing for P. aeruginosa yielded one VME for the WalkAway and
Prompt read/inoculation combination (1/34, 2.9%), four VMEs with the autoSCAN-4 and
Prompt (4/34, 11.8%), two VMEs with the autoSCAN-4 and turbidity inoculation (2/34,
5.9%), and one VME when read manually with turbidity inoculation. Due to the high VME
rates, as a separate analysis, the sponsor included results from their Assay Development-3
Project which consisted of 18 levofloxacin resistant P. aeruginosa strains for the
WalkAway/Prompt comparison and 21 resistant strains for the manual/turbidity comparison.
All results were acceptable yielding a 1.9% (1/52) VME for the WalkAway/Prompt, and
1.8% (1/55) VME rate for the manual/turbidity combinations, however, this is not reflected
in performance tables 4 and 5 below. Given that there was only one very major error for the
WalkAway and manual methods and acceptable VME rates with the pooled data, the
performance was considered acceptable. However, due to the high VME rate for the
autoSCAN-4, the sponsor included the following as a limitation should the user yield an MIC
result of 1 µg/mL:
Due to the occurrence of very major errors with levofloxacin and the autoSCAN-4 with
both turbidity and Prompt inoculation methods, isolates of P. aeruginosa that provide
and MIC of 1 μg/mL should be interpreted manually prior to reporting.
For this review, the interpretative criteria are applied to Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella spp.,
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa according to the FDA STIC website. As required under
511A(2)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the following statements were
included under Warning and Precautions Section in the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative
MIC/Combo Panels package insert:
The safety and efficacy of antimicrobial agents tested by this device, may or may not have
been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical
infections due to microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage
section in the drug label. The clinical significance in those instances is unknown. The

approved labeling for specific antimicrobial agents provides the uses for which the
antimicrobial drug is approved.

Essential agreement (EA) occurs when the result of the reference method and that of the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative
MIC/Combo Panel are within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on
scale for both the reference method and the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel. Category agreement (CA)
occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation provided by the
MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel.

Isolates from the following CDC and FDA Antibiotic Resistance Isolate Bank panels were evaluated:
Enterobacteriaceae Carbapenem Breakpoint Panel, Enterobacteriaceae Carbapenemase Diversity
Panel, Gram Negative Carbapenemase Detection Panel, and the Ceftolozane/tazobactam Panel.
Trending
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data for each
organism group and for each inoculation and read method. This trending calculation takes into
account MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilution lower or higher
compared to the reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values are on scale or not.
Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact
agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the trending analysis.
Trending results for indicated species were evaluated to determine if species-specific trends were
observed. Species or organism groups for which the difference between the percentage of
isolates with higher vs. lower readings was >30% and for which the confidence interval was
determined to be statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending
that provides higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in labeling.
A trend toward lower MIC readings was observed for Enterobacteriaceae using all read and
inoculation methods (Table 6) in comparison to the reference method. In addition, a trend toward
lower MIC readings was observed for P. aeruginosa using all read methods and turbidity
inoculation method and autoSCAN-4 reading method using the Prompt inoculation method.
Given this, the sponsor included the following footnote to the performance table in the device
labeling:
An MIC bias for Levofloxacin and Enterobacteriaceae with all read/inoculation methods,
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with all read methods/turbidity inoculation and the
autoSCAN-4/Prompt inoculation tended to be one doubling dilution lower than the
reference method.

IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that Beckman Coulter
intends to use to evaluate the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panels with
Levofloxacin (Lvx) (0.008 - 16 μg/mL) when revised breakpoints for levofloxacin are published
on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the submission
indicated that if specific criteria are met, Beckman Coulter will update the levofloxacin device
label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-evaluation
of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as
determined by their evaluation.
