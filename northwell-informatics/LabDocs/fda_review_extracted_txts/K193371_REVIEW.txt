III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System is a continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM) device with real time alarms capability indicated for the management of diabetes in
persons age 4 and older. It is intended to replace blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment
decisions, unless otherwise indicated.
The System also detects trends and tracks patterns and aids in the detection of episodes of
hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments.
Interpretation of the System readings should be based on the glucose trends and several
sequential readings over time.
The System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally connected devices.
The System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected devices where the
user manually controls actions for therapy decisions.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The System must not be used with automated insulin dosing (AID) systems, including closed
loop, hybrid closed loop, and insulin suspend systems.
Taking ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise
Sensor glucose readings. Inaccurate sensor readings due to ascorbic acid interfernce may be
clinically significant and result in harm if relied on to make treatment decisions. Taking more
than 500 mg of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which could cause you to
miss a severe low glucose event.
The System must be removed prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed
Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The effect of
MRI, CT scans, or diathermy on the performance of the System has not been evaluated. The
exposure may damage the Sensor and may impact proper function of the device which could
cause incorrect readings.
Do not use this system if you are pregnant, on dialysis, or critically ill. The System is not cleared
for use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or medications common to
these populations may affect performance of the System.
Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: if you are experiencing
symptoms that are not consistent with the glucose readings, consult your health care
professional.
Do not use the Sysetm in people less than 4 years of age.
K193371 - Page 2 of 30

--- Page 3 ---
Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the "check
blood glucose" symbol during the first 12 hours or wearing a Sensor. In additoin, use your blood
glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions if your Sensor glucose reading does not
match how you feel, or if the reading does not include a number.
Wash application site on the back of your upper arm using a plain soap, dry, and then clea with
an alcohol wipe. This will hep remove any oily residue that may prevent the sensor from sticking
properly. Allow site to air dry before proceeding. Carefully preparing the site according to these
instructions will help the Sensor stay on your body for the full 14-day wear period and help
prevent it from falling off early.
Store the Sensor Kit between 36°F and 82°F. If you suspect that the temperature may exceeed
82°F (e.g., an un-airconditioned home in the summer), you should refridgerate your Sensor Kit.
Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.
You must scan the Sensor to get your real-time current glucose level as the Reader will not
provide this information without a scan.
The Readers's built-in meter is not for use on people who are dehydrated, hypotensive, in shock,
or for individuals in hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state, with or without ketosis.
The Reader's built-in meter is not for use on neonates, in critically-ill patients, or for diagnosis or
screening of diabetes.
Take standard precautions for transmission of blood borne pathogens to avoid contamination.
Use of the Sensor with devices, apps, and software that are not listed by the manufacturer as
compatible with the System may cause inaccuracte glucose readings.
If a Sensor breaks inside a user’s body, they should call their healthcare professional.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System (hereon referred to as the ‘FreeStyle
Libre 2 System or ‘System’) is an integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) that
provides continuous glucose measurements every minute to provide glucose levels, trends and
alerts. The FreeStyle Libre 2 System consist of two primary components: a sensor which
transmits via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and a BLE enabled display device (Reader). User-
initiated scanning provides the user with current glucose measurements (glucose values)
accompanied by trend information (glucose arrows) and historical glucose information (glucose
graph). The user may determine their treatment based on the glucose values provided by the
K193371 - Page 3 of 30

--- Page 4 ---
System. The Reader does not provide glucose values, arrows, or graph information to users in the
absence of a user-initiated action (a sensor scan). The Reader only monitors glucose values in
real-time to provide alerts and alarms which, when enabled, warn the user of Low Glucose, High
Glucose or Signal Loss and prompt the user to scan the Sensor.
FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor
• The Sensor is single use and disposable. The Sensor is provided as two secondary
components, Sensor Applicator and Sensor Pack (sterile device) which are used to
assemble and apply the Sensor to the back of the user’s arm. The Sensor continuously
measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and has an 8-hour memory
capacity. The Sensor is factory calibrated, does not require fingerstick calibration and
can be worn for up to 14 days.
FreeStyle Libre 2 Reader
• The Reader is a small handheld device, which uses RFID communication to start new
sensors and to scan sensors to display and record data. It also uses BLE
communication to issue alarms that notify the user to perform a user-initiated scan
when glucose has passed a high or low glucose threshold. The Reader also has a built-
in strip port with blood glucose meter functionality (that is intended to work with the
FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose test strips, cleared under K171941), and a
user interface which includes event logging features. Modifications to the blood
glucose meter functionality include the addition of a BLE chip. (The modifications
would not impact the blood glucose meter performance, therefore new performance
data was not evaluated in this submission.)
The FreeStyle Libre 2 System is an interoperable connected device that can communicate
glucose readings and other information wirelessly and securely to and from interoperable
electronic interfaces. The System is intended to be used where the user utilizes CGM information
to manually control actions for therapy decisions. The device is also designed, and has been
validated, to be able to provide real-time glucose information to other digitally connected devices
that are authorized to be used in that manner. The System must not be used with automated
insulin dosing (AID) systems, including full closed loop, hybrid closed loop, and insulin suspend
(e.g., threshold suspend and predictive low glucose suspend) systems.
B Principle of Operation:
The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System uses an electrochemical sensor to
monitor glucose levels in the interstitial fluid (ISF). The sensor incorporates both the
subcutaneously implanted sensor and associated electronics. The sensor uses a glucose oxidase
enzyme to oxidize glucose and transfer electrons to a metal electrode, producing a current. The
strength of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the interstitial fluid.
The FreeStyle Libre 2 System converts the electrical current signal to a glucose value (in mg/dL)
for display on the handheld Reader.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
iCGM performance was evaluated in clinical studies described below in section C(3).
Subjects wore two sensors concurrently, one on the back of each upper arm, to evaluate
device precision.
In the Adult study (18 years and older), the mean paired absolute relative difference (between
the 2 concurrently worn devices) was 8.1%; and the mean coefficient of variation (mean
%CV) was 5.7%.
For pediatric age 4-5 years old, the mean paired absolute relative difference was 6.7%; and
the mean %CV was 4.8%. For pediatric age 6-17 years, the mean paired absolute relative
difference was 8.2%; and the mean %CV
was 5.8%.

2. Linearity:
The reportable range for the FreeStyle Libre 2 System is 40 to 400 mg/dL. Data supporting
this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3)
below.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Certain endogenous and exogenous substances in the interstitial fluid may interfere with
iCGM measurements. The types of potential interference and the extent of bias are dependent
on the test principle of the sensor technology. For this device, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has
been shown to significantly interfere with system performance.
A clinical study was conducted to evaluate ascorbic acid interference for the FreeStyle Libre
2 System. This was a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study that enrolled 60 subjects at
4 sites. The study was designed to evaluate performance of the system in people with
diabetes (age 18 and older) taking ascorbic acid. Each subject wore two sensors, one on the
back of each upper arm, for a period of up to 10 days.
The interference effect of ascorbic acid on the Freestyle Libre 2 System was assessed by the
difference (mg/dL) between CGM and comparator method (CM), in this case the Yellow
Springs Instrument Life Sciences 2300 STAT PlusTM Glucose and Lactate Analyzer, readings
at baseline and after each ascorbic acid doses. In this study, maximum bias was observed
approximately 2 to 3 hours after each ascorbic acid dose.
The maximum average bias was +9.3 mg/dL after one1000 mg dose. The maximum average
total biases were 18.4 mg/dL and 19.7 mg/dL (vs. baseline) after the second and third 1000
mg doses (given every 4 hours), respectively. Based on the clinical study to assess vitamin C
interference and the bench studies, the expected positive bias from a single dose of 500 mg
ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was estimated to be approximately 4.5 mg/dL.
The sponsor’s bench dose response studies demonstrated that ascorbic acid interference is
proportional to ascorbic acid concentration and is independent of the background glucose
concentration. Therefore, there is significant risk that a positive bias of 10-20 mg/dL when
true glucose values are low (e.g., 65-70) could lead users to miss clinically important low

glucose values. This bias is also in the context of an additional positive systemic bias in the
Sensor in the low glucose range. In the absence of high dose vitamin C supplementation,
information in the public domain suggests that the mean vitamin C intake (dietary intake and
low dose supplement combined) of the intended use population is less than 500 mg per day.
However, high dose vitamin C supplements (e.g., 1000 mg per dose) are common, and may
be taken sporadically (e.g. at times of air travel or illness). In addition, some people take high
dose supplements more than once per day. Finally, vitamin C levels not always clearly
understood by lay users. For example, one gram may seem smaller than 500 mg to users who
do not completely understand the metric system.
The Benefit/Risk Analysis completed at the time of the De Novo request for evaluation of
automatic class III designation for the predicate device that resulted in the iCGM regulation
states that “risks of this device include … Use of an iCGM as part of another digitally
connected medical device system, such as an AID system, when the iCGM has inadequate
analytical or clinical performance to support the intended use of the digitally connected device”.
The Special Controls proposed mitigating this risk by stating that “(4) The device must
demonstrate clinically acceptable performance in the presence of clinically relevant levels of
potential interfering substances that are reasonably present in the intended use population,
including but not limited to endogenous substances and metabolites, foods, dietary supplements,
and medications.”
iCGM systems have multiple types of uses. They are generally used to generate glucose readings
for the management of diabetes, to send alarms as a safety feature, and provide the convenience
of digital connection to many devices. One of the proposed uses of the Freestyle Libre 2 System
is to replace most blood glucose readings that users would need to make treatment decisions. We
considered that some blood glucose meters have interference from vitamin C and other
compounds, and labeling language has been frequently used to mitigate those risks. Labeling in
the case of certain interferences for blood glucose meters is adequate mitigation because the user
evaluates each reading prior to using it to make a treatment decision to determine whether it
matches the way they feel and their current activities/actions. We determined that when the
Freestyle Libre 2 system is for a use similar to a blood glucose meter, where users make
decisions themselves for each reading, labeling is also adequate to mitigate the risks of this high
bias due to vitamin C. For example, if a user sees sensor readings that look incorrect to them,
they may realize that they took vitamin C, or take a blood glucose reading, and take safe action to
adjust their response to the sensor readings.
The following statements have been placed in the device labeling to inform users of the risk
of falsely high glucose results when taking vitamin C containing supplements:
• User Manual Warning: Taking ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplements while wearing
the Sensor may falsely raise Sensor glucose readings. Taking more than 500 mg of
ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which could cause you to miss a
severe low glucose event. Ascorbic acid can be found in supplements including
multivitamins. Some supplements, including cold remedies such as Airborne® and
Emergen-C®, may contain high doses of 1000 mg of ascorbic acid and should not be
taken while using the Sensor. See your healthcare professional to understand how
long ascorbic acid is active in your body.
• Reader Screen Warning: Do not take high doses of vitamin C (more than 500 mg per
day). This may falsely raise your Sensor readings. Supplements like Airborne or
K193371 - Page 11 of 30

--- Page 12 ---
Emergen-C have high doses of vitamin C. Read labeling for all supplements to
determine vitamin C content.
However, when values from the Freestyle Libre 2 system are used automatically by an AID
system to start or stop insulin or other medications, the user has less opportunity to recognize the
interference prior to erroneous treatment. The risks introduced by this interference when used
with an AID system are greater than for similar iCGM devices, yet the benefits are largely equal.
Therefore, the benefits do not outweigh the risks for that use. Thus, the Freestyle Libre 2 system
must not be used with AID systems.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range for the FreeStyle Libre 2 System is 40 to 400 mg/dL. Data supporting
this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3)
below.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor has a storage shelf-life of 9 months. Shelf-life was evaluated at
36° –82° Fahrenheit within the humidity range of 10% - 90%.
6. Detection Limit:
If a glucose measurement is less than 40 mg/dL, the result will be displayed by the system as
‘LO’. If the glucose measurement exceeds 400 mg/dL, the result will be displayed as ‘HI’.
Data supporting this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study
described in Section C(3) below.

To demonstrate the accuracy performance of the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring
System, two prospective clinical studies were conducted in the United States at five and four
centers, respectively.
Study 1 enrolled 146 adult subjects with diabetes (91.1% with Type 1 diabetes and 8.9% with
insulin-requiring Type 2 diabetes). Subjects wore 2 sensors for up to 14 days but accuracy
analysis is based on the first applied sensor to each subject only. Subjects took part in up to
three ten-hour clinical sessions that took place during four distinct periods: Days 1-3; Days 7-
8; Days 9-12, and Days 13-14. During each clinic session, each subject’s glucose was
manipulated to observe data spanning the measuring range.
Study 2 enrolled 139 pediatric subjects with diabetes (98.6% with Type 1 diabetes and 1.4%
with insulin-requiring Type 2 diabetes). Subjects wore 2 sensors for up to 14 days and
accuracy analysis is based on the first applied sensor to each subject only. Subjects age six
and older took part in one or two eight-hour clinical sessions. Self-monitoring blood glucose
meter (SMBG) was used as the comparator method for subjects 4-5 years of age. Clinic
sessions for each subject took place during four distinct periods: Days 1-2; Days 7-8; Days 9-
12, and Days 13-. During each clinic session, glucose levels were manipulated in Subjects 11
years and older to observe data spanning the measuring range. Subjects 10 years and younger
underwent observation only without glucose manipulation.
In both studies, accuracy of the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System was
evaluated by comparing iCGM glucose values to an FDA-cleared laboratory grade
comparator method (YSI 2300) for subjects 6 years and older, and to SMBG in subjects 4-5
years old.

Glucose values were obtained from the system and from the comparator at the same or
similar time. In both studies, absolute differences in mg/dL of values compared to the
comparator method were calculated for all values below 70 mg/dL. For values of 70 mg/dL
and above, percentage differences compared to the comparator method were calculated.
Data from the two clinical studies are presented in the tables below.

Trend Accuracy
Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose
and is characterized by slopes, such as from > 2mg/dL/min to <-2 mg/dL/min. Trend
accuracy was assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change from the iCGM
and the corresponding comparator values for each iCGM-comparator measurement pair.

Agreement When iCGM Reads ‘LO’ or ‘HI’
The FreeStyle Libre 2 Glucose Monitoring System reports glucose readings between 40 and
400 mg/dL. When the system determines that the glucose reading is below 40 mg/dL, it will
display ‘LO’ whenever the sensor is scanned. When the system determines that the glucose
reading is above 400 mg/dL, it will display ‘HI’ whenever the sensor is scanned. Because the
system does not display glucose values below 40 mg/dL or above 400 mg/dL, the
comparisons to the actual blood glucose levels (as determined by the comparator) when the
iCGM value is classified as ‘LO’ or ‘HI’ are evaluated separately. The cumulative
percentages of when the comparator values were less than certain glucose values (for ‘LO’)
and when comparator values were more that certain glucose values (for ‘HI’) are presented in
the tables below.

Alarm Performance
The tables in this section show the accuracy of the System’s Low and High Glucose Alarms.
The Alarm Rate tells the user how often the alarm is right or wrong. The Detection Rate tells
the user how often the System is able to recognize and notify the user about a low or high
glucose event (within 15 minutes before or after the event).
Low Glucose Alarm Performance
True Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was below the
alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.
False Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was not below the
alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.

Sensor Stability
Sensor stability describes the performance of the sensor over the sensor lifetime. Sensors can
be worn for up to 14 days. Performance was estimated by calculating the mean of the
absolute relative differences between iCGM and comparator measurement and percentage of
device readings within 15 mg/dL or 15% (15/15%), 20 mg/dL or 20% (20/20%) and 40
mg/dL or 405 (40/40%) of the comparator values during the beginning, early middle, late
middle, and end of the wear period. These times were defined as follows:
• Beginning (Adult Days 1-3, Pediatric: Days 1-2)
• Early Middle (Adult: Days 7-8, Pediatric: Days 7-8),
• Late Middle (Adult: Days 9-12, Pediatric: Days 9-12), and
• End (Adult: Days 13-14, Pediatric: Days 13-14).

A separate analysis was done regarding early sensor terminations due to sensor knock-offs
(when a sensor falls off due to being forcibly pushed off). All adult and pediatric subjects
wore two sensors (one on each arm) and all sensors worn within the study were included in
the sensor survival rate analysis. It was observed that sensors worn on the patient’s dominant
arm were more likely to be knocked off than those worn on the non-dominant arm.
In a previously conducted adult sensor wear study, participants cleaned the sensor application
site with soap and water prior to sensor application. It was observed that those subjects who
cleaned the application site appropriately were able to achieve the full 14-day sensor wear
time. To mitigate the risk of early sensor termination due to sensor knock off and failure to
clean insertion site, the following information was provided in the User Guide:
Wash application site using a plain soap, dry, and then clean with an alcohol wipe. This will
help remove any oily residue that may prevent the Sensor from sticking properly. Allow site
to air dry before proceeding. Note: The area MUST be clean and dry following these
instructions, or the Sensor may not stay on for the full 14-day wear period.
A third clinical study was also conducted to further evaluate wear duration in subjects who
first washed the insertion site with a plain soap and water, according to the full instructions in
the labeling and wore only a single Sensor. Of the 39 Sensors evaluated in this study, 38
sensors (97%) lasted until the final day of use (14 days).
Glucose Reading Availability
The System is designed to show a Sensor glucose reading after each scan that is performed
throughout the wear period after the start-up time. As such, the capture rate characterizes the
reliability of the communication between components of the system.
