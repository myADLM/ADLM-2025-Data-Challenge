IV. Device/System Characteristics:
A. Device Description:
BOND Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16), Novocastra
Liquid Mouse Monoclonal Antibody Progesterone Receptor Clone 16 (Concentrated
Liquid Antibody Format)
• Progesterone Receptor Clone (16) or PR (16) is a mouse anti-human monoclonal
antibody produced as a tissue culture supernatant and supplied in Tris buffered saline
with carrier protein containing 0.35% ProClin 950 as preservative. This antibody is
utilized to perform a qualitative IHC assay to identify Progesterone Receptor (PR)
expression in human breast cancer tissue routinely processed and paraffin-embedded
for histological examination. There are two configurations of the RTU antibody: 7 mL
and 30 mL.
• PR (16) Primary Antibody is provided in a Ready-to- Use (RTU) and a concentrated
liquid format. The RTU format is supplied in Tris buffered saline with carrier protein,
containing 0.35% ProClin™ 950 as a preservative and is provided in two volumes (7
mL and 30 mL). The total protein concentration is approximately 10 mg/mL and the
total antibody concentration is greater than or equal to 1 mg/L as determined by
ELISA. The RTU format is optimally diluted for use on the automated BOND-MAX
and BOND-III instrument staining platforms in combination with BOND Polymer
Refine Detection kit. The concentrated liquid format is for manual staining protocols.
• The concentrated liquid antibody format is a liquid tissue culture supernatant
containing 15 mM sodium azide as a preservative. The total protein concentration is
determined on a per batch basis and is described on the vial label, and the antibody
concentration is greater than or equal to 324.0 mg/L as determined by ELISA.
BOND-III Instrument
• The BOND-MAX and BOND-III instruments are fully automated slide stainers that
perform automated deparaffinization (dewaxing), antigen retrieval, IHC staining/in
situ hybridization (ISH) staining, and counterstaining. The major components of the
BOND staining platforms are the processing module, computer (BOND controller),
handheld ID scanner, and slide label printer. The BOND staining platforms are
composed of a number of discrete software components including the BOND
K193393 - Page 3 of 14

--- Page 4 ---
application software, BOND instrument/processing module software, BOND service
software, and Laboratory interface system - integration package (LIS-IP).
B. Principle of Operation:
Immunohistochemical techniques are used to demonstrate the presence of antigens in tissue and
cells. The recommended staining protocol for PR (16) primary antibody is IHC Protocol F:
Heat induced epitope retrieval is recommended using Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 for 20
minutes. Bond Polymer Refine Detection utilizes a novel controlled polymerization technology
to prepare polymeric HRP-linker antibody conjugates.
Bond Polymer Refine Detection works as follows:
• The specimen is incubated with hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase
activity.
• Bond RTU Primary Antibody PR (16) is applied.
• A post primary antibody solution enhances penetration of the subsequent polymer
reagent
• A poly-HRP anti-mouse/rabbit IgG reagent localizes the primary antibody.
• The substrate chromogen, 3,3’- diaminobenzidine (DAB), visualizes the complex via
a brown precipitate.
• Hematoxylin (blue) counterstaining allows the visualization of cell nuclei using Bond
Polymer Refine Detection in combination with the automated BOND-MAX system
reduces the possibility of human error and inherent variability resulting from
individual reagent dilution, manual pipetting and reagent application.

The between-day study involved testing of sectioned slides from 27 unique FFPE breast tumor
tissue specimens. The slides consisted of 13 PR negative specimens, 14 PR positive specimens
including 5 PR low positive tissue specimens (1-10% staining). The study was conducted using
three BOND-III instruments at one laboratory-testing site. One sectioned slide from each unique
breast tumor tissue case (total 27) and three tissue control slides, one per Slide Staining
Assembly (SSA) were stained with Lot 1 on Days 1 and 2, Lot 2 on Days 3 and 4, and Lot 3 on
Days 5 and 6 on a single BOND-III instrument. Each unique breast tissue case was also stained
using 2 additional instruments such that the lots and days tested were varied. BOND-III
instrument has 30 slide positions allowing for 9 unique cases and a tissue control to be run on
each SSA and for all 27 cases to be stained in a single run. Each day a single case was stained 3
times, once on each of the three instruments. In total, using 3 SSAs per instrument and 3
instruments, 486 measurements were generated (3 instruments x 3 SSAs x 9 slides x 6 days) .
Acceptance Criteria for between-days, between-instruments, between lots, between pathologists
and between laboratories studies are as follows:
The Overall Agreement (OA), Positive Agreement (PA) and Negative Agreement (NA), shall be

d. Between-lot repeatability
The between-lot study involved testing of sectioned slides from 27 unique FFPE breast tumor
tissue specimens. The slides consisted pf 13 PR negatives, 14 PR positives (>10% staining)
including 5 PR low positive tissue specimens (1-10% staining). The study was conducted using
three BOND-III instruments at one laboratory-testing site. One sectioned slide from each unique
breast tumor tissue case (total 27) and three tissue control slides (one per SSA) were stained with
Lot 1 on Days 1 and 2, Lot 2 on Days 3 and 4, and Lot 3 on Days 5 and 6 on a single BOND-III
instrument. Each unique breast tissue case was also stained using 2 additional instruments such
that lots and days tested varied. BOND-III instrument has 30 slide positions allowing for 9
unique cases and a tissue control to be run on each SSA and for all 27 cases to be stained in a
single run. Each day a single case was stained 3 times, once on each of three instruments. In
total, using 3 SSAs per instrument and 3 instruments, 486 measurements were generated (3
instruments x 3 SSAs x 9 slides x 6 days).

Reproducibility Studies
The purpose of the reproducibility study was to generate data in support of the validation of the
Leica BOND Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16) on the BOND-III
instrument at one internal laboratory-testing site and two external laboratory-testing sites in the
US. The study assessed the following potential sources of assay variability for the BOND Ready-
to-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16) on the BOND-III Instrument:
• Between-pathologist reproducibility
• Between-laboratory reproducibility
The reproducibility panel consisted of slides from 135 cases. Each site stained 1 slide from each
of the 135 cases, totaling 405 slides combined. Each slide was read by each of 3 pathologists,
totaling 1215 readings combined. Each pathologist (1 per site), read slides from all 3 sites (i.e.,
each pathologist read a slide from the same case 3 times).

• Inter-pathologist study: The concordance between pairs of pathologists (Pathologist 1 vs.
2, 1 vs. 3 and 2 vs. 3) was calculated by Overall Percent Agreement (OPA) and Average
Negative Agreement (ANA). Negative and positive percent agreements (NPA, PPA),
were weighted as per their marginal totals. Nonparametric bootstrap methods were used
to calculate the confidence interval for APA and ANA to preserve the correlation
structure of the pair.
• Inter-laboratory study: A similar concordance analysis between pairs of laboratory-
testing sites (Site 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3 and 2 vs. 3) was carried out for 135 cases with 3 slides
per case totaling 405 slides combined.

5. Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The original stability studies on BOND Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor
(16), 7 mL, were submitted in K062615. The sponsor submitted the continued stability studies on
the existing 7 mL, and the additional stability studies and justification on the new 30 mL
configuration, including real-time, transport, in use and cut section stability studies in Section 14
of the K193393:
Three batches (lots) of antibody in immediate packaging (batches 1, 2 and 3) were manufactured
and then stored under recommended storage conditions (40C). All three lots were used in the
Real-Time Stability Test to determine the shelf-life of the BOND Ready-to-Use Primary
Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16). In addition to Real-Time Stability testing, all units of
batch 1 underwent a transport simulation test. Following the completion of the transport
simulation test, units from lot 1 were used for the In-Use test and the Accelerated Stability
Testing. Stability studies were performed on both BOND-MAX and BOND-III systems.
Results and Conclusion:
• Stability study data support the claim for 7 mL Bond RTU Primary Antibody
Progesterone Receptor (16), for shelf life of 18 months (545 days) from the point of
manufacture when stored at 2-8°C.
• Stability study data support the claim for 30 mL Bond RTU Primary Antibody
Progesterone Receptor (16), for shelf life of 18 months (545 days) from the point of
manufacture when stored at 2-8°C.

B. Comparison Studies:
a. Method Comparison with the Predicate Device:
The objective of the method comparison study was to evaluate the concordance of results
obtained using BOND Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16) on BOND-
III (subject device), with results obtained using BOND Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody
Progesterone Receptor (16), (K171753), on BOND-MAX (predicate device, K062615). The
study was conducted at three laboratory-testing sites. Each site tested 152 of 456 unique FFPE
breast whole tissue sections on the BOND-III instrument, and 152 on the BOND-MAX (two
unstained slides were received per each of 152 specimens). One trained pathologist interpreted
the stained slides at each site. Positive (endometrium) and negative (tonsil) tissue controls were
used in the study.
Scoring:
Tissue is considered “PR Positive” when ≥1% of tumor nuclei are immunoreactive for PR. When
<1% of tumor cells are immunoreactive for PR, the tissue is considered “PR Negative”.
Acceptance criteria:
The lower bounds of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval BOND-III of the OPA, PPA and NPA
shall be ≥ 85% when using BOND Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody Progesterone Receptor (16)
on BOND-III compared to BOND-MAX.
