III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
For in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of digoxin in serum and plasma
(EDTA and lithium heparin) using the ADVIA Centaur XP systems. Measurements obtained by
this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of digoxin overdose and in monitoring levels
of digoxin to ensure appropriate therapy.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The assay is to be used on the ADVIA Centaur® XP.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ADVIA Centaur® Digoxin assay reagents are available in two configurations consisting of
either one or five ReadyPack primary reagent packs and the ADVIA Centaur DIG Master Curve.
Each ReadyPack consists of the following:
• ADVIA Centaur DIG ReadyPack® primary reagent pack; Lite Reagent 2.5 mL/reagent
pack monoclonal mouse anti-digoxin antibody (~26.4 ng/mL) labeled with acridinium
ester in protein buffered saline with sodium azide (0.11%) and preservatives.
• ADVIA Centaur DIG ReadyPack primary reagent pack; Solid Phase Reagent 12.5
mL/reagent pack digitoxin (~2 ng/mL) covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in
protein buffered saline with sodium azide (0.11%) and preservatives.
B Principle of Operation:
The ADVIA Centaur Digoxin assay is a competitive immunoassay using digitoxin, which is
covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in the Solid Phase for a limited amount of
acridinium ester-labeled monoclonal mouse anti-digoxin antibody in the Lite Reagent. Within
the patient sample, the digoxin competes with the digitoxin, and an inverse relationship exist
between the amount of digoxin present and the amount of relative light units detected by the
system.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Testing of interferents was performed using the paired difference approach and was
performed to simulate effect of partially filled blood collection plasma tube. Human K2-
EDTA and lithium heparin pools, one at low and the other at high digoxin level for each
matrix were used to titrate the anticoagulants. The nominal EDTA and Heparin
concentrations are 1.8 mg/mL and 15.0 U/mL in blood collection tubes respectively. EDTA
and Heparin were spiked 3 times and 5 times the additive concentration for testing with the
candidate device. Each of these sample matrices had an aliquot as a control (spiked with
deionized water) and an aliquot spiked with interferent. Testing was performed on one
ADVIA Centaur® system with one reagent lot in 10 replicates. The observed interference
effect, Dobs, was computed as the difference between the means of the test and control
samples.
Dobs = Interference = (test sample mean – control sample mean)
To report the level of interferent for a quantitative assay as percent (%) bias, the following
calculation was used: % Bias = [100* Dobs] / [control sample mean]
The sponsor defined significant interference as a bias > ±10%. Results are summarized
below:
Potential interferent Highest concentration tested that
showed no interference
K2-EDTA 9.0 mg/mL
Lithium heparin 75 U/mL
The sponsor also conducted interference testing to evaluate the effect of endogenous
substances - Spironolactone, Canrenone and Potassium Canrenoate that may be present in
specimens. Testing consisted of human serum pools at two levels of digoxin used to titrate
the testing compounds in the paired difference approach, by dividing the two serum pools
into aliquots and spiked with the possible interferents. The control samples without the
interferent were spiked with the solvent. The digoxin concentration of the spiked samples
was compared to the digoxin concentration determined for the control samples. Testing was
performed on one ADVIA Centaur® XP system with one reagent lot in 8 replicates per
sample. The observed interference effect, Dobs, was computed as the difference between the
means of the test and control samples. Results are summarized below:
Highest concentration tested that
Interferent
showed no interference
Canrenone 1000 ng/mL
Spironolactone 1000 ng/mL
Potassium Canrenoate 1000 ng/mL
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range of the assay is from 0.1 to 5.0 ng/mL.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The ADVIA Centaur Digoxin assay is traceable to an internal standard manufactured using
U.S.P. (United States Pharmacopeia) material. Assigned values for calibrators are traceable
to this standardization.”
The sponsor has provided data to support the following sample stability claims:
Do not use samples that have been stored at room temperature for longer than 8 hours.
Tightly cap and refrigerate specimens at 2–8°C if the assay is not completed within 8 hours.
Freeze samples at or below -20°C if the sample is not assayed within 48 hours.
Freeze samples only once and mix thoroughly after thawing.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Not applicable.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The sponsor included the following information and references in the labeling:
A therapeutic range of 0.8 to 2.0 ng/mL (1.024 to 2.56 nmol/L) has been previously reported
for digoxin.1,2
It is important to point out that the distinction between adequate digitalization and toxicity in
patients cannot be made on the basis of digoxin concentration alone. Findings must be
interpreted with a knowledge of this limitation.
As with all therapeutic drug assays, each laboratory should determine the appropriateness of
this range for the diagnostic evaluation of patient results.3
