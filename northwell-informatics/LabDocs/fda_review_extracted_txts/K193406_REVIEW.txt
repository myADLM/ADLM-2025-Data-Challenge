D Special Instrument Requirements:
CardioChek Plus Analyzer
CardioChek Plus Home Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The CardioChek Plus and CardioChek Plus Home Test Systems consist of the analyzer and
analyte specific test strips. The CardioChek Test Systems consist of both a reflectance
photometer and amperometer. Test strips for measuring cholesterol, lipoprotein (HDL),
triglycerides, and glucose by reflectance are available for use with the systems. Additional
glucose test strips (eGlu test strips) are available to determine glucose amperometrically.
The test strips are packaged in a vial with a MEMo Chip (contains lot specific test strip
information) and instructions. The analyzer is provided with analyzer check strips to use as a
K193406 - Page 6 of 12

--- Page 7 ---
check of the electronic and optical components of the analyzer. Certain test strip box
configurations may include a single-use only blood lancet (previously cleared under k920562).
Quality control materials are available for purchase separately: PTS Panels multi-chemistry
controls (Level 1 and Level 2) and PTS Panels HDL cholesterol controls (Level 1 and Level 2).
B Principle of Operation:
The CardioChek analyzers employs both light reflectance and electrochemical biosensor
technology to measure an enzymatic chemical reaction. When a blood sample is applied to a
reflectance test strip, a chemical reaction occurs that produces a color change on the test strip.
When blood is applied to an electrochemical test strip, an electrical current is produced. The
resulting color or current is measured and compared to a calibration curve stored in the lot-
specific MEMo Chip. The analyzer converts this color or current reading into a test result (the
darker the color or greater the electrical current, the higher the analyte concentration) that is
displayed on the meter.

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software
development processes for this line of product types.
1. Instrument Name:
CardioChek Plus Analyzer
CardioChek Plus Home Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Test results are automatically stored in the CardioChek analyzer’s memory. The analyzer can
store up to 50 results of each analyte and 10 results for control tests. The analyzer allows
review of the results in order from the most recent to the oldest. Each result is displayed with
time and date.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The CardioChek Plus Test System is intended to be used with venous whole blood and
capillary whole blood from the fingertip and the CardioChek Plus Home Test System is
intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip. The whole blood sample is
applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

Each package of test strips contains a MEMo Chip that contains lot specific test strip
information such as the calibration curve, test strip lot number and the measuring range for
each test. The MEMo Chip must be inserted into the meter to run a test with blood or quality
control material. The labeling instructs the user to match the lot number code on the test strip
vial, MEMo Chip and analyzer.
5. Quality Control:
Liquid quality control materials for use with the systems can be purchased separately: PTS
Panels multi-chemistry controls (Level 1 and Level 2) and PTS Panels HDL cholesterol
controls (Level 1 and Level 2). Recommendations on when to perform a control test are
provided in the labeling. The analyzers have a Control Test setting for the user to select when
performing the test so that Control results will be stored in the meter separately from the
patient results. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control results fall outside the
ranges provided on the range card provided with the controls.
Analyzer check strips are provided for use with the analyzers to check that the analyzer’s
electronic and optical systems are functioning properly. It is recommended that the check
strip verification be performed: daily, if the analyzer has been dropped, or if a result is
inconsistent with expected results.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
The CardioChek Plus and CardioChek Plus Home Test Systems consist of the same physical
analyzer and test strips. The differences between the systems include the intended use setting
(prescription use in professional healthcare settings vs. over-the-counter), the claimed sample
types and the names.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
See k140068, k151545 and k162282 for the candidate systems and test strips.
2. Linearity:
See k140068, k151545 and k162282 for the candidate systems and test strips.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
See k140068, k151545 and k162282 for the candidate systems and test strips.
The following are included in the labeling for both systems:
- Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and dopamine may interfere causing the test result to be higher
than the actual glucose.
- Dopamine and methyldopa decreased the results of HDL cholesterol.
- Extremely high doses of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) may decrease HDL results. Normal
concentrations of Vitamin C did not affect the glucose results.
- Grossly lipemic samples may interfere with some methodologies.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable ranges have not changed. The reportable ranges are listed in the package
insert for each test strip as:
Glucose: 40-600 mg/dL
Cholesterol (total): 100-400 mg/dL
Lipoprotein (HDL): 20-120 mg/dL
Triglyceride: 50-500 mg/dL
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
See k140068, k151545 and k162282 for the candidate systems and test strips.
6. Detection Limit:
The detection limits have not changed. See section VII.A.4 above for the measuring ranges
for each analyte.

F. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Electrical Safety
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety testing of the
analyzer with the modified battery compartment had been performed and the system was found
to be compliant.
Thermal Testing
The sponsor conducted thermal testing using the modified battery compartment and batteries
inserted incorrectly (reverse/backwards insertion) demonstrating that the modified battery
compartment functioned as intended and adequately mitigated the risk of overheating with
improper insertion of batteries.
Usability study
The sponsor conducted a usability study using the modified systems with the updated menu
display on the analyzer. Participants in the study were representative of the intended users of
each system (professional users and lay-users). Results demonstrated that users were able to
navigate the menu and perform testing successfully.
Infection control
The CardioChek Plus Test System is intended for multiple-patient use in professional healthcare
settings. The CardioChek Plus Home Test System is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection
efficacy studies were performed previously (k140068) by an outside commercial testing
laboratory demonstrated complete inactivation of duck hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen
disinfectant, Super Sani-Cloth (EPA Registration #9480-4). Previous robustness studies
(k140068) demonstrated that there was no change in performance, functionality or external
materials after 11,001 cleaning and 11,001 disinfection cycles designed to simulate a 3 year use
life of the device. Adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures
are provided in the labeling of the device.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
