IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Contour® next GEN Blood Glucose Monitoring System has been developed for use with the
currently marketed Contour® NEXT Test Strip. The new system utilizes amperometric biosensor
technology to quantitatively measure the glucose concentration in whole blood in five seconds.
This new Contour® next GEN blood glucose monitoring system includes the meter, test strips,
the Contour® Diabetes App, a lancing device, lancets, User Guide, Quick Reference Guide,
carrying case, registration/warranty card, and control solution. The Contour® Diabetes App is
compatible with Android (operating systems 5.0, 6.0. 7.0, 8.0, 9.0. 10.0, and 11.0) and Apple
devices (iOS 12.0, 13.0, and 14.0)
B Principle of Operation:
The Contour® next GEN Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures the amount of glucose in
whole blood quantitative using fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip amperometrically.
The reaction of glucose dehydrogenase and an electron mediator in the test strip with glucose in
the sample produces an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the
sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose
concentration, which is displayed by both the meter meter’s display screen and the Contour®
Diabetes app.

2. Linearity:
To evaluate linearity, a study was conducted using twelve blood samples adjusted to glucose
concentrations covering the reportable range of 20 to 600 mg/dL. The specific glucose values
by the YSI analyzer were 22.5, 39.5, 78.9, 139.3, 199.5, 262.5, 314.3, 380.3, 433.3, 498.5,
556.5, and 592.0 mg/dL. Results on the candidate device were compared to YSI 2300 Stat
Plus Glucose Analyzer. Each glucose level was tested in replicates of 24 using three test
strip lots. Plasma glucose concentrations were measured on the YSI 2300 analyzer before and
after each blood specimen was tested on meters, and the average of results was used as the
comparison value. Proportionally weighted least squares regression produced the following:
Lot Slope y-intercept r2
1 0.975 1.91 0.9980
2 0.996 0.72 0.9980
3 0.989 1.45 0.9984
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20 – 600
mg/dL. If the concentration of a sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the
meter as LO. If the concentration of a sample is greater than 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged
by the meter as HI. The low and high functions were validated and were demonstrated to
function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the effect of common exogenous and endogenous
compounds with the potential to interfere with the glucose measurements.
Venous blood samples were prepared at glucose concentrations of approximately 60 mg/dL
(3.3 mmol/L), 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) and 260 mg/dL (14.4 mmol/L) and were divided into
a test pool with the potential interferent added and a control sample with no added
interferent.

One measurement was made with a test strip from each of three lots on each of the 10 meters
using each of the three glucose levels. This produces 10 measurements per meter per lot for
each glucose concentration, resulting in a total of 90 measurements for each interferent.
Results on the candidate meter from the test samples were compared to results obtained on
the candidate meter from the control sample. The highest tested concentrations at which no
significant interference was observed are presented in the following table:

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Lay-user Performance study:
To assess the performance of the Contour® next GEN Blood Glucose Monitoring System in
the hands of the intended users, the sponsor performed a lay user study with 371 English
speaking participants who were untrained (including naïve users and people with diabetes).
The data was collected using three test strip lots at two clinical trial sites. The participants
were responsible for obtaining their own fingertip capillary sample and performing a blood
glucose test using only the instructions from the product labeling written in English.
Results were analyzed by comparing the blood glucose results obtained by the lay users with
the Contour® next GEN Next Gen Blood Glucose Monitoring System against results
obtained with a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI Model 2300 STAT PLUS glucose
analyzer). The glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from 55 to 467 mg/dL, as
measured by the YSI Model 2300 STAT PLUS glucose analyzer. Results are summarized in
the tables below:
Glucose Concentrations < 75mg/dL

An additional study was conducted to assess the accuracy of the Contour® next GEN system
at the extreme low and high ends of the claimed measurement range using 120 capillary
whole blood samples with glucose concentrations below 80 mg/dL, and 128 samples greater
than 250 mg/dL. Samples were altered by spiking or glycolysis in order to obtain the appropriate
glucose concentrations. Samples were tested with the Contour® next GEN system with test
strips from 3 lots and compared to the results obtained on YSI 2300 analyzer. The glucose
concentrations in the samples ranged from 23 - 77 mg/dL on the lower end and 255 - 592 mg/dL
on the higher end, as measured by the YSI 2300. Results from one representative lot are
summarized below:

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit study: To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the Contour® next GEN Blood
Glucose Monitoring System, the sponsor analyzed venous whole blood samples at hematocrit
levels of 20, 25, 30, 35, 42, 45, 50, 55, and 60% ± 2%. Each hematocrit level was adjusted to
achieve five glucose levels of approximately 40, 70, 130, 200, and 350 mg/dL. Three strip
lots and 24 meters were used to collect data for each hematocrit level and glucose level (n=24
per lot per hematocrit per glucose level). The percent biases relative to the comparator
method demonstrated were acceptable to support the claimed hematocrit range of 20 to 55%.
2. The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.6 µL.
Venous whole blood samples were adjusted to approximately 55, 110, 220, and 525 mg/dL.
Each sample was analyzed with a sample size of 0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60, and 0.70 µL using
three strip lots and 10 Contour® Next meters. Results support the sponsor’s minimum
claimed sample volume of 0.6 µL.
3. Operating Conditions Study: The effect of operating temperatures and relative humidity on
the performance of the Contour® next GEN Blood Glucose Monitoring System was
evaluated using venous whole blood samples adjusted to approximately 40, 120, 350, and
525 mg/dL. Testing was conducted under the following temperature and relative humidity
(RH) combinations: 5°C / 10% RH low temperature, low humidity); 5°C / 93% RH (low
temperature, high humidity); 45°C / 10% RH (high temperature, low humidity); 45°C / 93%
RH (high temperature, high humidity). Glucose results obtained under these conditions was
collected using 15 Contour® Next meters and three lots of test strips and results were
compared to the nominal condition (25°C / 50% RH). The study results support the claimed
operating conditions of 5° to 45°C (41°F to 113°F) with relative humidity of 10% to 93%.
4. Altitude Study: To evaluate the effect of altitude, a study was conducted using venous whole
blood samples adjusted to four concentration levels of glucose ranging from 47-408 mg/dL.
Samples were placed under conditions to simulate altitude condition from 443 feet (sea level)
to 20,674 feet. Each blood sample was tested using six meters with two lots of test strips.
The values obtained at simulated altitudes were compared with the values obtained at the
nominal condition. The results demonstrated acceptable bias to the nominal condition to
support the claim in the labeling that glucose measurement performance is maintained at
altitudes up to 20,674 feet.
5. Flex Studies: Sample perturbation, testing with used test strips, drop, vibration and shipping
testing was completed. The testing performed demonstrated that the device is robust to
intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, drop/shock, and vibration, and that an error
message is returned to the user if a used test strip is inserted into the meter.
6. The sponsor provided documentation certifying that electrostatic discharge, electromagnetic
interference, electrical safety, and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been
performed and the system was found to be compliant.
7. Intermittent Sampling (2nd chance testing): The Contour® next GEN Blood Glucose
Monitoring System allows the user to reapply the blood sample within 60 seconds if the
initial sample is insufficient to fill the test chamber. To evaluate this, the sponsor performed
a study using blood samples adjusted to glucose concentrations of 60, 110, and 220 mg/dL.

Each of the three levels was tested at a hematocrit of 20, 42, and 55 for a total of nine distinct
glucose/hematocrit combinations using 10 meters. The study evaluated meter performance
with different initial volumes and different delay times before additional blood was added.
The results were compared to the nominal condition of 0.6 µL of blood applied and the
results support that accurate results are obtained with intermittent sampling.
8. Infection Control Studies: The Contour® next GEN Blood Glucose Monitoring System is
intended for single patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the
meter materials by an outside commercial laboratory, demonstrating complete inactivation of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant Clorox Healthcare® Bleach Germicidal
Wipes (EPA Registration Number 67619-12). Robustness studies were also performed by
the sponsor using the Contour® Next Blood Glucose Monitoring System demonstrating that
there was no change in the performance of the system or in the external materials of the
meter after 260 cycles of cleaning and disinfection using the chosen disinfectant. The
robustness studies were designed to simulate cleaning and disinfecting over the 5-year single-
patient use life of the meter. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
9. Test Strip Lot Release Protocol: Glucose test strip lot release protocols and criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
