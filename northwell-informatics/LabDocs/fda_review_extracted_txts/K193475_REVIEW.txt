The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to
600 mg/dL. Data from the bench studies and software verification studies were provided to
demonstrate that if a sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter and a
warning error “Extreme Low Glucose – Below 20 mg/dL – Treat Low” is displayed, as
intended. If a sample result is more than 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter and a
warning error “Extreme High Glucose – Above 600 mg/dL” is displayed, as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed by altering venous whole blood to achieve three glucose
concentration levels (60, 120 and 260 mg/dL). Each of these samples was divided into a test
pool and a control pool and each of 32 potential endogenous and exogenous interfering
substances was added to the test pool. Each potential interferent was tested on three lots of
test strips. The highest tested concentrations at which no significant interference was
observed (defined by the sponsor as within ±6.04 mg/dL at glucose levels <80 mg/dL and
within ±7.38% at glucose levels ≥80 mg/dL when comparing the test sample relative to the
control sample) with the OneTouch Verio Reflect Glucose Monitoring System are presented

F. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit Study:
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the OneTouch Verio Reflect Blood Glucose
Monitoring System, venous blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of 20%, 25%,
30%, 35%, 42%, 50%, 55%, and 60%. Each hematocrit level was adjusted to achieve five
glucose levels (approximately 45, 65, 130, 200, 350 mg/dL). Each sample was tested using
10 OneTouch Verio Reflect meters and three OneTouch Verio Test Strip lots and the results
were compared to those obtained from the YSI 2300 comparator method. The percent biases
relative to the YSI demonstrated acceptable performance to support the claimed hematocrit
range of 20 to 60%.
2. Altitude Testing:
Altitude testing was previously established in k150214 to support the claims in the labeling
that the system can be used at altitudes of up to 10,000 ft.
3. Operating Conditions study:
The effect of temperature and relative humidity on the OneTouch Verio Reflect Blood
Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples from 3 donors
adjusted to 5 glucose concentrations (approximately 65, 150, 240, 350, and 450 mg/dL.)
Testing was conducted under the following temperature and relative humidity (RH)
combinations: (41˚F(5ºC)/50%RH, 48˚F(9ºC)/10%RH, 48˚F(9ºC)/50%RH,
48˚F(9ºC)/90%RH, 72˚F(22ºC)/10%RH, (nominal/control laboratory condition of
72˚F(22ºC)/50%RH), 72˚F (22ºC)/90%RH, 106˚F(41ºC)/10%RH), 106˚F(41ºC)/50%RH),
106˚F(41ºC)/90%RH), 113˚F(45ºC)/50%RH). Samples were tested under each
temperature/humidity condition using 6 meters and 3 lots of test strips. The results support

the claims in the labeling that the OneTouch Verio Reflect Blood Glucose Monitoring
System can be used in conditions of 43-111°F (6-44°C) and 10 %RH to 90 %RH.
4. Sample Volume Study:
The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.4 μL for
the Verio Reflect Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples with 3
glucose concentrations (approximately 60, 110 and 225mg/dL) were tested at 4 sample
volumes (0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 μl) using 3 lots of test strips. Values obtained were compared
to the comparator YSI 2300 and results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.4
μl for the system. The meter has an error message displayed if enough blood is not added to
the test strip. This feature was validated and was shown to function as intended.
5. Flex Studies
Drop testing, vibration testing, intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, and testing with
used test strips were completed. The testing performed demonstrated that the device is robust
to these common use scenarios, and that the appropriate error messages are returned to the
user if one of the situations has occurred.
6. Infection Control studies
The OneTouch Verio Reflect Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for single-
patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the meter materials by an
outside commercial laboratory, demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) with the chosen disinfectant Clorox Germicidal Wipe (EPA Registration Number
67619-12). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor using the OneTouch
Verio Reflect System demonstrating that there was no change in the performance of the
system or in the external materials of the meter after 209 cleaning and disinfection cycles and
418 additional cleaning cycles using the chosen disinfectant. The robustness studies were
designed to simulate cleaning and disinfecting over the 4-year single-patient use life of the
meter. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
7. Electrical Safety and EMC testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed and the system was
found to be compliant.
8. Test Strip Lot Release Protocol:
The test strip lot release protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
