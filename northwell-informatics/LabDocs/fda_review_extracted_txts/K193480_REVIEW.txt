Configuration of the BIOEASY Multi-Drug Test Cup tests can consist of any combination of the
above listed drug analytes.
The test may yield positive results for the prescription drugs Buprenorphine, Nortriptyline,
Oxazepam, Secobarbital, Propoxyphene and Oxycodone when taken at or above prescribed
doses. It is not intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse of these drugs. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when the preliminary result is positive. The test provides only preliminary test
results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None. This is an assay only device.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
K193480 - Page 3 of 14

--- Page 4 ---
The BIOEASY Multi-Drug Test Cup tests are immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral
flow system for the qualitative detection of Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Marijuana,
Methamphetamine, Morphine, Oxycodone, Secobarbital, Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxy-
methamphetamine, Phencyclidine, Methadone, Nortriptyline and Propoxyphene (target analytes)
in human urine. The products are single-use in vitro diagnostic devices. Each test kit contains a
Test Device, a package insert and a urine cup for sample collection. Each test device is sealed
with a desiccant in an aluminum pouch.
B Principle of Operation:
The BIOEASY Multi-Drug Test Cup tests are rapid tests for the qualitative detection of
Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Marijuana, Methamphetamine, Morphine, Oxycodone,
Secobarbital, Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxy-methamphetamine, Phencyclidine, Methadone,
Nortriptyline and Propoxyphene in urine samples. The tests are lateral flow chromatographic
immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target
drugs present in the urine specimen are below the cut-off concentration, it will not saturate the
binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles. The antibody-
coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line
will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the
target drug level exceeds its cutoff-concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of
the antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices
regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been
performed properly.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Combined precision and cutoff studies were carried out using samples at the analyte
concentrations: -100% cutoff, -75% cutoff, -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff, cutoff, +25% cutoff,
+50% cutoff, +75% cutoff and +100% cutoff of Morphine 2000 ng/mL. These samples were
prepared by spiking morphine in negative urine samples to achieve final concentration of
4080 ng/mL, 3560 ng/mL, 3065 ng/mL, 2465 ng/mL, 2025 ng/mL, 1480 ng/mL, 970 ng/mL,
455 ng/mL and 0 ng/mL morphine as measured by LC/MS. All sample aliquots were blinded
and labeled by the person who prepared the samples and did not participate in sample testing.
Each sample was tested by three operators in two runs per day for 25 days per device lot in a
randomized order using three lots of the candidate device. The results obtained are
summarized in the following table for morphine 2000 ng/mL. The precision data for

2. Linearity:
Not applicable, these devices are intended for qualitative use only.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference Studies:
Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological
conditions were added to drug-free urine and urine with concentrations at 25% below
(morphine 1500 ng/mL) and 25% above (morphine 2500 ng/mL) the cutoff level of 2000
ng/mL morphine. These urine samples were tested using three lots of the device by three
operators. Compounds that showed no interference at a concentration of 100 µg/mL
(albumin was tested at 100 mg/dL, ethanol at 1%, bilirubin at 500 µg/mL) are summarized in
the following tables. The interferences data for Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine,

morphine or structurally related drugs cross-react with the candidate device. These
compounds added at 100 µg/mL concentration in pooled negative human urine samples.
Compounds that tested positive were serially diluted until a negative result was observed.
The minimum concentration of each compound producing a positive result is shown in the
table below. The cross-reactivity data for Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Marijuana,
Methamphetamine, Morphine (300), Oxycodone, Secobarbital, Buprenorphine,

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples, with 1.000 to
1.035 specific gravity or urine samples with pH 4 to 9 were spiked with morphine at 25%
below (morphine 1500 ng/mL) and 25% above (morphine 2500 ng/mL) the cutoff of 2000
ng/mL. These samples were tested by three operators using three lots of the candidate
device. For all lots tested, results were all positive for samples at and above +25% cutoff and
all negative for samples below -25% cutoff. The data for Amphetamine, Oxazepam,
Cocaine, Marijuana, Methamphetamine, Morphine (300), Oxycodone, Secobarbital,
Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxy-methamphetamine, Phencyclidine, Methadone,
Nortriptyline and Propoxyphene were previously reported in k182530.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The candidate device is stable at 4 °C – 30 °C for 24 months based on the real
time stability studies at both 4 °C and 30 °C. A transport simulation study was conducted to
demonstrate that the candidate device is stable at the conditions of 40 °C and -20 °C for up to
35 days.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
See section VII.A.1.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study for the BOEASY Multi-Drug Test Cup Morphine (2000 ng/mL)
test strip was conducted in-house by three laboratory personnel using one lot of the candidate
device. Each of the three operators tested 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical
samples. The samples were blind-labeled and randomized by a laboratory personnel who
does not participate in sample testing. The candidate device results were compared to results
obtained by LC/MS. The study results are summarized in the below. The accuracy data for
Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Marijuana, Methamphetamine, Morphine (300),
Oxycodone, Secobarbital, Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxy-methamphetamine,
Phencyclidine, Methadone, Nortriptyline and Propoxyphene were reported in k182530.

Lay user study:
A lay user study was conducted at three intended user sites by 300 lay users using three lots
of the candidate device. The lay users had diverse educational and professional backgrounds.
Urine samples were prepared by spiking amphetamine, oxazepam, cocaine, marijuana,
methamphetamine, morphine, oxycodone, secobarbital, buprenorphine, methylenedioxy-
methamphetamine, phencyclidine, methadone, nortriptyline and propoxyphene at various
concentrations (negative, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff) into 23 drug-free urine
sample pools. The concentration of the drugs in these samples were confirmed by
LC/MS/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled by a lab
personnel who did not participate in sample testing. Each lay user participant was provided
with the package insert, one blind labeled sample and a candidate device, with no training to
test the sample. The results are summarized in the below table.
