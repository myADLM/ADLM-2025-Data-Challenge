IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test is a cartridge-based immunoassay intended to detect C.
difficile toxin A and/or toxin B in stool samples from patients suspected of C. difficile infection
(CDI). Each single-use test cartridge contains the lyophilized reagents required to perform three
measurements each for C. difficile toxin A and toxin B: Total Signal Measurement,
Neutralization Measurement, and Positive Control Measurement. The test kit also includes the
following components used to prepare specimens for testing: C. difficile Stool Specimen Diluent,
C. difficile Protease Inhibitor reagent, and Spin Columns for stool specimen manual filtration.
The assay is performed on the MultiPath Analyzer, which is an automated benchtop laboratory
instrument intended for use by trained laboratory technicians. The Analyzer includes the
following functionality: a barcode scanner for test-specific and specimen-specific information, a
pneumatic system that drives fluidics within the test cartridge, a magnetic station that deposits
magnetically-tagged fluorescent targeted molecules onto the cartridge imaging surface, an
optical system to detect deposited fluorescent particles, and automated software to analyze the
test measurement and interpret the results based on predefined signal measurement thresholds for
Toxin A and Toxin B total signals and neutralization measurements. The Analyzer uses a touch
screen display User Interface to convey test information, status, instructions and user input. Up
to five cartridges can be loaded onto the Analyzer at one time.

B Principle of Operation:
The SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test uses separate monoclonal antibodies that are conjugated to
magnetic particles or fluorescent particles to capture and detect antigen, respectively. Labeled
antibody-antigen complexes are deposited onto an imaging surface, and the MultiPath Analyzer
uses digital imaging to automatically detect and interpret the assay signal.

The reproducibility of the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test was evaluated at three sites over
five days by two operators each day. The sample panels consisted of Stool Specimen Diluent
aliquots spiked with both Toxins A and B at the following concentrations: low positive (1-2x
LoD), moderate positive (2-4x LoD), high positive (5-8x LoD), and negative (unspiked). The
panels were randomized and masked and then distributed to each site. Prior to testing, each
operator mixed the designated sample with pooled stool matrix that was prescreened and
known to be negative for C. difficile Toxins A and B. The samples were processed according
to the labelled test procedure and tested with the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test in triplicate
for a total of 90 observations per panel member. The qualitative test results for detecting
Toxin A (Table 1), Toxin B (Table 2) and each panel member (i.e., detection of Toxin A or
B, Table 3. Reproducibility – Table 3) are summarized below.
Overall, 16/360 (4.4%) samples initially produced invalid results in the study. All samples
were valid upon retest following labeled instructions. All high positive panel members
produced the expected positive results for both toxin A and B (90/90, 100%). For the
moderate positive panel members, one sample produced false negative results for both toxin
A and B at one site (89/90, 98.9%). Also, one negative sample at the same site produced false
positive results for both toxin A and B (89/90, 98.9%). For the low positive panel members,
one sample produced a false negative result for toxin A at one site (89/90, 98.9%), and all
sites produced the expected positive result for toxin B (90/90, 100%).

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interfering substances
Endogenous and exogenous substances commonly found in stool were evaluated for their
potential effect on the performance of the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test. Negative pooled
stool and contrived positive pooled stool containing 15 ng/mL of Toxin A (4x LoD) and 300
pg/mL of Toxin B (6x LoD) were tested unspiked (positive and negative control) as well as
spiked with the potential interferents shown in Table 4 and tested in triplicate.
All negative samples produced the expected negative results in the presence of each
substance. One initial invalid result was observed in the presence of Metronidazole at 40
mg/mL (1/115, 0.9% initial invalid rate); however, the sample produced the valid expected
result upon repeat testing (0% final invalid rate). Out of six sample replicates tested with
Vancomycin at 50 mg/mL, one false negative Toxin A result and one false negative Toxin B
result were observed. No assay interference was observed in the presence of Vancomycin at
40 mg/mL or in the presence of the other substances at the concentrations tested.

Analytical Specificity
The analytical specificity of the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test was evaluated by testing a
panel of microorganisms commonly found in stool samples (Table 5). Cultured organisms
were spiked into negative pooled stool or spiked into contrived positive stool containing 15
ng/mL Toxin A (4x LoD) and 300 pg/mL Toxin B (6x LoD). Bacteria and yeast were tested
at 1x106 CFU/mL and viruses were tested at 1x105 PFU/mL, except for Norovirus (7x104
PFU/mL) and Echovirus (4.1x104 PFU/mL). All microorganisms were tested in triplicate
with the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test. No false positive results were observed. Initial
invalid results were obtained for four samples (4/135, 3.0% initial invalid rate), and all
samples produced the expected valid result upon repeat (0% final invalid rate).

1 The potential for purified Clostridium sordellii toxin to cross-react was not evaluated.
It is unknown if C. sordellii toxin concentration in the 106 CFU/mL preparation that
was tested falls below the limit of detection for the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test.
Microbial Interference
Microbial interference was evaluated for the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test by using the
same panel of microorganisms from in the analytical specificity study (Table 5) spiked into
contrived positive stool containing 15 ng/mL Toxin A (4x LoD) and 300 pg/mL Toxin B (6x
LoD). Toxins A and B were detected in all samples indicating lack of interference. However,
one initial invalid result was observed (1/135, 0.7% initial invalid rate), and the sample
produced the expected valid result upon retest per the study protocol and assay instructions
(0% final invalid rate).
Hook Effect
A study was conducted with the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test to determine if high
concentrations of target C. difficile toxins interfere with the test result (hook effect). Diluted
toxins (Toxin A dilutions from 50 µg/mL – 2.5 ng/mL, Toxin B dilutions from 1.3 µg/mL –
66 pg/mL) were spiked into pooled negative stool and three replicates per dilution were
tested with the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test. No false negative results were observed for
either toxin at any concentration tested.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Quality Control
The SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test uses internal positive controls (individual wells specific
to each toxin and contained within the test cartridge) as well as external positive and negative
controls. Quality control procedures monitor the accuracy and precision of the analytical
process. It is recommended that External Controls be tested at least once every 30 days, when
a new reagent lot is received in the laboratory, and when the MultiPath Analyzer undergoes
installation, repair or maintenance procedures. External controls are required but not
provided with the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test.
A minimum of one positive and one negative external control were used each day prior to
testing clinical specimens or performing analytical studies. Controls were processed in the
same manner as clinical specimens and results interpreted in accordance with the SensiTox
C. difficile Toxin Test software assay parameters. To pass, a positive control must detect both
Toxins A and B while the negative control must generate a negative result for both,
according to the instructions for use of the external control kit. During the clinical study, a
total of 343 external controls were run (169 positive and 174 negative controls). Of the 343
controls tested, 10 generated invalid results (2.9% invalid rate). Of the 333 valid QC results,
two were QC failures (i.e., incorrect result). Per the study protocol, when this occurred
another control was tested and passed which made the clinical specimen data acceptable for
analysis on those days.
MultiPath Analyzer
Additional assay and instrument parameters are monitored during a test run on the MultiPath
Analyzer. These include sample input errors, instrument cartridge processing errors, and
instrument system messages.
Specimen Stability
A study was conducted to evaluate the stability of stool samples that have been stored
refrigerated at 2 – 8 ℃ for analysis with the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test. Seven
individual stool samples and one pool of two stool samples were collected and confirmed
negative for C. difficile A and B toxins with the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test. Sample
aliquots were spiked with each target toxin individually at 15 ng/mL (4x LoD) for Toxin A
and 250 pg/mL (5x LoD) for Toxin B. The samples were stored refrigerated and a minimum
of three replicates each were tested with the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test at different time
points. Spiked samples were tested after 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 100 hours of storage, and
unspiked negative samples were tested after 0, 96, and 100 hours of storage.
Although there were trends of decreasing assay toxin signal average values and increasing
neutralization ratio average values in spiked samples over time, the values were well within
the cutoff threshold values to support a 72 hours stability claim when stored refrigerated at 2
– 8 ℃.
6. Detection Limit and Analytical Reactivity:
Limit of Detection
The limit of detection (LoD) for Toxins A and B was determined by spiking known
concentrations of purified Toxin A and B into negative pooled stool and testing with the
K193490 - Page 9 of 13

--- Page 10 ---
SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test. Concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 ng/mL for Toxin A
and 30 to 100 pg/mL for Toxin B were tested using three reagent lots across two analyzers.
Twenty replicates per analyte dilution and per reagent lot were tested for a total of 60
replicates per analyte concentration. The LoD for each toxin was defined as the lowest
concentration that generated a Detected result ≥ 95% of the time. The LoD for Toxin A was
3.5 ng/mL and the LoD for Toxin B was 50 pg/mL.
Analytical reactivity (Inclusivity)
A study was conducted to demonstrate reactivity of the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test with
C. difficile A and B toxins sourced from a diverse collection of clinically relevant C. difficile
strain ribotypes and toxinotypes (Table 6). Toxin A was purified from six ribotypes and
tested at 15 ng/mL (4x LoD). Toxin B was purified from eight ribotypes and tested at 300
pg/mL (6x LoD). As a positive control, Toxins A and B were purified from the wildtype
strain (ribotype 087), which was the standard toxin used throughout product development.
All samples produced the expected positive result with the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test.
One initial invalid result was observed in the study (1/49, 2.0% initial invalid rate), and this
sample produced the valid expected result upon repeat testing (0% final invalid rate).

7. Assay Cut-Off:
Assay parameter thresholds were established based on the evaluation of negative stool
specimens, contrived stool specimens spiked with C. difficile A and B toxins, and clinical
specimens characterized by cellular cytotoxicity neutralization assay (CCNA) for C. difficile
toxins. This included approximately 200 spiked specimens, 500 initial CCNA specimens, and
an additional 300 CCNA specimens for confirmation.

9. Carry-Over:
A study was conducted to determine if carry-over contamination occurs within runs or
between runs with the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test on the MultiPath Analyzer. The study
used negative pooled stool samples and high positive samples contrived by spiking both
Toxin A and B into negative stool at a concentration of 1.3 µg/mL (more than 370X LoD for
Toxin A and 26,000X LoD for Toxin B). In total, 13 high positive and 13 negative samples
were prepared in individual test cartridges and run on one MultiPath Analyzer using an
alternating pattern within-run and between-run for a total of five runs. No evidence of carry-
over effect was observed as all negative samples in the study produced the expected Not
Detected result for both toxins.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test was evaluated in a prospective
clinical study performed at three geographically diverse sites in the US. The study tested left-
over, de-identified, unpreserved liquid or soft stool specimens sequentially collected from
patients suspected of C. difficile infection. Stool specimens were stored up to 72 hours
refrigerated at 2 – 8 ℃ prior to testing with the investigational device. Test performance was
evaluated in comparison to the results of the cellular cytotoxicity neutralization assay which
detects the presence of C. difficile toxin in fecal sample filtrates. Samples were stored and
tested in accordance with the assay instructions and specifications.
Specimen inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined in the protocol. Specimens that met
the study inclusion criteria and that did not meet any of the exclusion criteria were included
in the analysis. Out of 1107 enrolled samples, 27 samples were excluded from the analysis
due to sample processing or shipping errors and 20 samples were excluded due to storage
outside of the sample stability timeframe. Results from a total of 1060 samples were
available for analysis; 621 (59%) collected from females, 438 (41%) collected from males,
and one collected from an individual whose gender was unknown. The age distribution is
shown in Table 7.

Total 1060 100%
Of the 1060 samples, 14 samples (1.3%) required repeat testing with the SensiTox C. difficile
Toxin Test due to initial invalid results, per the protocol. However, samples were not retested
because they were either unavailable or exceeded the 72-hour sample stability timeframe.
The remaining 1046 samples with valid results were included in the performance analysis.
The performance of the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test compared to the cellular cytotoxicity
neutralization assay is shown in Table 8.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
In the clinical study, a total of 1107 left-over, de-identified, unpreserved liquid or soft stool
specimens sequentially collected from patients suspected of C. difficile infection were enrolled
from three geographically diverse sites in the US. Of these specimens, 1046 provided valid test
results for analysis of which 96 were positive by the cellular cytotoxicity neutralization assay
comparator for an overall observed prevalence of 9.2% (96/1046). The overall percentage of
positive results observed with the SensiTox C. difficile Toxin Test was 12.2% (128/1046).
