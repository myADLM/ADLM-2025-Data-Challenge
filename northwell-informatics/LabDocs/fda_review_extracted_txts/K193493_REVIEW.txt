IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ADVIA Centaur Total IgE (tIgE) reagent kit contains the following:
ADVIA Centaur Total IgE Ready Pack primary reagent pack consist of the ADVIA Centaur tIgE
Lite Reagent and Solid Phase Reagents:
• Lite Reagent: 5.0 mL/pack of goat anti-human IgE antibody (~2.4 μg/mL) labeled with
acridinium ester in buffer with sodium azide (0.12%), protein stabilizers, and preservatives.
• Solid Phase Reagent: 22.5 mL/pack of mouse anti-human IgE antibody (~0.02 mg/mL)
covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in buffer with protein stabilizers, sodium azide
(0.11%), and preservatives.
Materials Required but not provided
• ADVIA Centaur Calibrator 80 consists of low and high levels of human IgE in equine serum
and preservatives.
Optional Reagents
• ADVIA Centaur IgE Master Curve Material (MCM) consists of MCM 1 that is lyophilized
human plasma with sodium azide (0.1% after reconstitution) and preservatives, and MCM 2-
7 that are various levels of IgE in lyophilized human plasma with sodium azide (0.1% after
reconstitution) and preservatives.

B Principle of Operation:
K193493 - Page 2 of 7

--- Page 3 ---
The ADVIA Centaur Total IgE (tIgE) assay is a fully automated, two-site sandwich
immunoassay using direct chemiluminescent technology. The sample is incubated with both the
Lite and Solid Phase Reagents simultaneously for 7.5 minutes at 37°C. After incubation, the
immuno-complex is washed, and the Acid Reagent and Base Reagent are added to initiate the
chemiluminescent reaction. A direct relationship exists between the amount of total IgE present
in the patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system.

heparin concentrations are 1.8 mg/mL and 15.0 U/mL in blood collection tubes, respectively.
Both K2-EDTA and lithium heparin were spiked at three times and five times the additive
concentration for testing. Testing was performed in six replicates per sample on one ADVIA
Centaur XP instrument using one lot of reagent. The recovery was calculated as the
difference between the means of the test samples spiked with the interferent and control
samples spiked with the same volume of the interferent vehicle. Results summarized in the
table below show no significant assay interference was demonstrated with K2-EDTA and
lithium heparin at the indicated test concentrations.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The claimed measuring range is from 2.5 IU/mL to 3000 IU/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The traceability and reagent stability were established in K920372.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation for the
ADVIA Centaur Total IgE (tIgE) assay were determined in accordance with the CLSI
guideline EP17-A2.
The LoB was determined using two lots of reagents and one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument.
For lot 1, four analyte-free serum samples were tested in five replicates per sample, two runs
per day for five days to obtain a total of 240 replicates. For lot 2, five analyte-free serum
samples were tested in five replicates per sample, two runs per day for five days, to obtain a
total of 300 replicates. The LoB was estimated as the 95th percentile of the measurements for
each of the lots tested and determined to be 0.69 IU/mL and 0.28 IU/mL for the two lots of
reagents. The claimed LoB is 1.5 IU/mL.
The LoD was determined using 10 patient serum pools with low analyte levels. Each sample
was tested in five replicates per run, two runs per day, for six days on one ADVIA Centaur
XP instrument using two lots of reagents. A total of 605 replicates was obtained for reagent
lot 1 and 557 replicates for reagent lot 2. The LoD was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of
the replicates for the low-level samples and determined as 1.20 IU/mL and 1.21 IU/mL for
the two lots of reagents. The claimed LoD is 2.0 IU/mL.

The LoQ was determined using 10 serum samples comprised of patient pools with low
analyte levels. Each sample was tested in six replicates per run, two runs per day, for five
days on one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument using two lots of reagents. A total of 600
replicates was obtained for reagent lot 1 and 420 replicates for reagent lot 2. The LoQ,
defined as the mean value of the sample which fulfills the specification for the total within-
laboratory imprecision ≤ 20% CV is 1.64 IU/mL and 1.75 IU/mL for the two lots of reagents.
The claimed LoQ is 2.5 IU/mL which is the lower limit of the measuring range claimed for
the assay.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison with predicate device was presented in K920372.
2. Matrix Comparison:
To demonstrate that Li-Heparin plasma and K2-EDTA plasma samples yield results
comparable with serum samples by the ADVIA Centaur Total IgE (tIgE) assay, a study was
performed by using 73 serum/K2-EDTA plasma paired samples and 73 serum/Li-heparin
plasma paired samples. Paired samples were each tested in singleton with one reagent lot on
one ADVIA Centaur XP system. The Deming regression analysis was performed, and the
results are summarized in the following table:
