IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System consists of the AUTION MAX AX-4060 urine
analyzer and the AUTION Sticks 9EB test strips. The test system is fully automated and
provides a semi-quantitative or qualitative measurement for glucose, protein, bilirubin,
urobilinogen, pH, blood, ketones, nitrites and leukocytes.
The AUTION sticks 9EB test strips consist of a plastic strip containing 9 dry chemistry reagent
pads impregnated with chemical substances for the determination of the above analytes in urine.
These substances if present in urine lead to a chemical reaction that results in a color change,
which is measured by the AUTION MAX AX-4060 urine analyzer based on spectrophotometry.
In addition, three additional parameters, specific gravity, turbidity, and color tone are directly
measured based on reflectance refractometry, transmitted, and scattered light measurements.

B Principle of Operation:
AUTION Sticks 9EB test strips
Glucose: Based on a double sequential enzyme reaction. Glucose oxidase catalyzes the formation
of gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide from the oxidation of glucose. A second enzyme,
peroxidase, catalyzes the oxidative coupling of 4-amino-antipyrine and 1-Naphthol3-6-disulfonic
acid by hydrogen peroxide to form a quinone imine purple color.
Protein: Based on the protein-error-of-indicators reaction. At a constant pH, the presence of
protein causes a change in the color of the indicator to a cyan color.
Bilirubin: The test is based on azo-coupling reaction of bilirubin with diazotized 2-methyl5-
nitroaniline in acidic medium. Varying bilirubin levels will produce a reddish-brown color.
Urobilinogen: The test is based on azo-coupling reaction of urobilinogen with diazotized 3,3’-
dimethyloxy-4,4’-biphenyl bis-diazonium tetrafluoroborate in acidic medium. Varying
urobilinogen levels will produce a reddish-brown color.
pH: Based on a mixed indicator principle that gives a broad range of colors (yellow to cyan)
covering the entire urinary pH range.
Ketones: Legal reaction. Based on the reaction of sodium nitroprusside with acetoacetic acid to
form a purple complex.
Nitrites: Griess reaction. Nitrite reacts with sulfanilamide, followed by a diazo-coupling reaction
to from a pink colored product.
Leukocytes: Granulocytic leukocytes contain esterases that catalyze the hydrolysis of 3-
(NToluenesulfonyl-L-alanyloxy) indole (TAI) to from indoxyl, which further reacts with 2-
Methoxy-4-(N-morpholino) benzenediazonium (MMB) to form a purple product.
Blood: Based on the peroxidase-like activity of hemoglobin, which catalyzes the reaction of
Cumene hydroperoxide and 3,3,5,5’- tetramethylbenzidine to form a cyan color.
AUTION MAX AX-4060 urine analyzer
Color: Urine color tone measurement, red (635 nm), green (525 nm) and blue (470 nm) lights are
transmitted to the sample in the cylindrical tube, and the hue and contrast of the sample are
obtained from the amount of transmitted light. Urine color is reported as colorless, yellow,
orange, brown, red, violet, blue, and green. Light, normal, or dark are also reported for each
color (for a total of 22 contrast and hue indications). The urine color measurement is also used
in this urinalysis system for a color correction algorithm to compensate for intrinsically colored
urine samples when testing for bilirubin, urobilinogen, and ketone analyte pads. The
measurements glucose, protein, pH, nitrites, leukocytes, and blood are not compensated for urine
color.

Two wavelengths are used for the reflectance determination of each analyte, except blood which
uses a single wavelength. The percent reflectance received by the optical sensor for each analyte
on the test strip is then used to calculate a semiquantitative value and a qualitative value. An
internal turbidity/color tone measurement unit measures sample turbidity based on the
calculation of scattered and transmitted light. Specific gravity is calculated based on the light
refraction of the urine sample (reflection-refractometry).
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
AUTION MAX AX-4060 urine analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Urine identification can be performed manually or with the analyzer barcode scanner.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples tubes are manually placed into a rack, which is loaded into the analyzer.
Alternatively, samples can be placed individually into the STAT port. Samples can be
labeled with a barcode, which is read with a barcode reader. Test strip picking, sample
transport, sample aspiration, sample dispensing onto the test strip, and measurement are
automated by the instrument.
4. Calibration:
The AUTION MAX AX-4060 urine analyzer requires optical unit calibration. For optical
unit calibration, the instrument only needs to be calibrated if the reflectivity for each
wavelength falls outside of the defined range in the measurement check and/or trouble with
the instrument is suspected.
5. Quality Control:
The sponsor states the following in their labeling: “Performance of the AUTION MAX AX-
4060 and the AUTION Sticks 9EB should be confirmed regularly utilizing both known
negative and known positive urine specimens or control materials.”

2. Linearity:
The sponsor performed other studies to establish sensitivity/cutoffs. Refer to the Detection
Limit and Sensitivity studies in section 6 below, for more information.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical specificity studies were conducted to assess for interfering effects of endogenous
substances (including pH and specific gravity) and therapeutic drugs on the AUTION MAX
AX-4060 Urinalysis System. Testing was performed on one (1) analyzer using one (1) lot of
test strips and conducted with urine samples prepared at two concentrations for each analyte,
with six (6) replicates per sample. A high positive sample was prepared by spiking each
analyte into pooled negative urine. A negative sample pool was also used. The sample pools
were spiked with potential interfering substances. Interference was defined when the color
block changed by more than ±1. The results of testing depicting the highest concentration of
the interferent tested with no effect, are provided below:

Interference effect of intrinsic urine color: Studies were conducted to verify that the test strip
analytes of protein, leukocytes, nitrite, ketones, glucose, urobilinogen and blood were insensitive
to interference from red, brown, orange, green and various yellow-intensity colored urine
samples. The results demonstrated that red, brown, orange, green and various yellow-intensity
urine colors do not significantly impact the results for those analytes tested since all results were
within +/- 1 color block.
Color Correction: The candidate device includes a feature that corrects for intrinsic urine color
for bilirubin, urobilinogen, and ketones. The sponsor also provided information to support this
feature.
Limitations: The following limitations are included in the labeling:
1. Elevated hematuria (6.25 mg/dL Hb, approximately 2,156 RBC/μL) has been shown
to cause falsely lowered Leukocyte readings and should be considered when
interpreting Leukocyte results.
2. Samples from patients taking methyl dopa may be falsely elevated for blood, negative
to trace at 67 mg/dL and negative to +1 at 225 mg/dL. Patients taking the maximum
daily dose of methyl dopa may have approximately 210 mg/dL methyl dopa excreted
in the urine.
3. Patients taking SGLT2 or similar inhibitors may have extremely high urinary glucose
values. Due to a hook effect on the glucose pad, if a patient’s urine glucose level is
greater than 20,000 mg/dL, then falsely decreased glucose results may be obtained
with the test.

9. Carry-Over:
A study was performed to evaluate carry-over contamination potential caused by the AX-
4060 nozzle and pump tubing from one sample to the next. Two sample pools were created at
two different analyte concentration levels (low target value [LTV] sample and high target
value [HTV] sample) created by spiking the pools with the appropriate analytes and tested to
ensure high/low testing rank. Testing found all the measurement results of the LTV sample
after HTV measurement agreed with the target block for each measurement item.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted at two (2) clinical laboratories to evaluate the
agreement of results from the AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System to the predicate
device, the AUTION MAX AX-4030 Urinalysis System.
1044 natural patient samples were tested at two sites, with additional spiked and archived
samples used to supplement abnormal analyte levels. Testing was performed in duplicate on
the comparator AX-4030. The results below compare the first replicate on the AX-4060
(candidate device) to the first replicate from the AX-4030 (comparator device). Duplicates
measured on the comparator were used to identify samples near the cutoff (i.e., where sample
replicates were not exact matches but were within one block). Based on duplicate testing on
the comparator, some of the discordant samples in the tables below were near the cutoff with
duplicate results within one color block.

Color Tone: This is a light-transmission-based color detection system which is integrated
into the AX-4060 analyzer and is independent of the 9EB test strip. This system reports the
color tone results and can detect the following urine colors: Colorless, Yellow, Orange,
Brown, Red, Violet, Blue, and Green. As a result of a lack of natural clinical specimens for
Brown, Green, Blue, Violet, and Red colors (due to the infrequent occurrence of urine
specimens of these colors), these colors were evaluated using contrived samples (dyes added
to natural urine samples).

Consistently positive glucose results should be clinically investigated.
Protein
Although very small quantities of protein are normally excreted, the amount is generally below
the sensitivity level for detection. Positive results require clinical assessment/additional testing to
determine its significance.
Bilirubin
In normal urine, no bilirubin is normally detected. Positive findings should be diagnostically and
clinically investigated.
Urobilinogen
Healthy individuals may excrete a small amount of Urobilinogen and may be increased
especially after exercise. Concentrations are generally at their peak in the afternoon.
pH
Normal and abnormal urine pH ranges from 5.0 to 8.0 and is influenced by diet. Typical values
for first morning specimens, from healthy individuals, are between pH 5.0 - 6.0.
Blood
A blue-green dotted reaction indicates the presence of erythrocytes. Up to 5 erythrocytes / μL
may be found in normal urine specimens. Urine from menstruating women may contain blood. A
large amount of blood should be clinically investigated.
Ketones
Ketones are not normally detected in urine specimens from healthy individuals. However, urine
specimens from individuals who are fasting, pregnant, or who undergo regular strenuous
exercise, may exhibit significant amounts of ketones. The presence of ketones, in urine
specimens from patients with diabetes, may provide a useful marker for metabolic status.
Nitrite
A nitrite concentration of as low as 0.08 mg/dL may be detected and produce a positive test. A
negative result may occur during fasting episodes since nitrates are not appearing in the urine.
Leukocytes
Normal urine specimens should not produce a positive reaction. Small amounts of leukocyte
esterase, causing a positive reaction should be repeated, using a fresh urine specimen, from the
same patient. Positive results require further testing for pyuria.
F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Not applicable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
