B Indication(s) for Use:
The BioFire Blood Culture Identification 2 (BCID2) Panel is a multiplexed nucleic acid test
intended for use with FilmArray 2.0 or FilmArray Torch systems for the simultaneous qualitative
detection and identification of multiple bacterial and yeast nucleic acids and select genetic
determinants associated with antimicrobial resistance. The BioFire BCID2 Panel test is
performed directly on blood culture samples identified as positive by a continuous monitoring
blood culture system. Results are intended to be interpreted in conjunction with Gram stain
results.
The following organism types and subtypes are identified using the BioFire BCID2 Panel:
Gram Positive Bacteria: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes,
Staphylococcus spp. (with specific differentiation of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus
epidermidis, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis), Streptococcus spp. (with specific differentiation

The BioFire BCID2 Panel contains assays for the detection of genetic determinants associated
with resistance to methicillin (mecA/C and mecA/C in conjunction with MREJ), vancomycin
(vanA and vanB), ß-lactams including penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and
carbapenems ( CTX-M, IMP, KPC, NDM, OXA48-like, VIM) to aid in the

identification of potentially antimicrobial-resistant organisms in positive blood culture samples.
In addition, the panel includes an assay for the detection of the mobilized colistin genetic
determinant mcr-1, an emerging marker of public health importance. The antimicrobial
resistance gene or marker detected may or may not be associated with the agent responsible for
disease. Negative results for these select antimicrobial resistance gene and marker assays do not
indicate susceptibility, as multiple mechanisms of resistance to methicillin, vancomycin, ß-
lactams, and colistin exist.
Antimicrobial Resistance Genes: CTX-M, IMP, KPC, mcr-1, mecA/C, mecA/C and MREJ
(MRSA), NDM, OXA-48-like, vanA/B and VIM
The BioFire BCID2 Panel is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of
bloodstream infection and results should be used in conjunction with other clinical and
laboratory findings. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with organisms not included in
the BioFire BCID2 Panel. The BioFire BCID2 Panel is not intended to monitor treatment for
blood stream infection.
Subculturing of positive blood cultures is necessary to recover organisms for susceptibility
testing and epidemiological typing, to identify organisms in the blood culture that are not
detected by the BioFire BCID2 Panel, and for determination of species detected but not
identified within complexes, groups, or genera by the BioFire BCID2 Panel assays.

A Device Description:
K193519 - Page 3 of 105

--- Page 4 ---
The BioFire Blood Culture Identification 2 (BCID2) Panel is designed to simultaneously identify
43 bacteria, yeast, and select genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance. The BioFire
BCID2 Panel is performed directly on positive blood culture samples. BioFire BCID2 Panel is
compatible with BioFire’s PCR-based in vitro diagnostic FilmArray 2.0 and FilmArray Torch
systems for infectious disease testing. A specific software module (i.e., BioFire BCID2 Panel
Pouch Module) is used to perform BioFire BCID2 Panel testing on these systems.
B Principle of Operation:
A test is initiated by loading Hydration Solution into one port of the FilmArray pouch and
positive blood culture specimen mixed with the provided Sample Buffer into the other port of the
BioFire BCID2 Panel pouch and placing it in a FilmArray instrument. The pouch contains all of
the reagents required for specimen testing and analysis in a freeze-dried format; the addition of
Hydration Solution and Sample/Buffer Mix rehydrates the reagents. After the pouch is prepared,
the FilmArray Software guides the user through the steps of placing the pouch into the
instrument, scanning the pouch barcode, entering the sample identification, and initiating the run.
The FilmArray instruments contain coordinated systems of inflatable bladders and seal points,
which act on the pouch to control the movement of liquid between the pouch blisters. When a
bladder is inflated over a reagent blister, it forces liquid from the blister into connecting
channels. Alternatively, when a seal is placed over a connecting channel it acts as a valve to open
or close a channel. In addition, electronically-controlled pneumatic pistons are positioned over
multiple plungers in order to deliver the rehydrated reagents into the blisters at the
appropriate times. Two Peltier devices control heating and cooling of the pouch to drive the PCR
reactions and the melt curve analysis.
Nucleic acid extraction occurs within the FilmArray pouch using mechanical and chemical lysis
followed by purification using standard magnetic bead technology. After extracting and
purifying nucleic acids from the unprocessed sample, the FilmArray performs a nested multiplex
PCR that is executed in two stages. During the first stage, the FilmArray performs a single, large
volume, highly multiplexed reverse transcription PCR (rt-PCR) reaction. The products from first
stage PCR are then diluted and combined with a fresh, primer-free master mix and a fluorescent
double-stranded DNA binding dye (LC Green® Plus, BioFire Diagnostics). The solution is then
distributed to each well of the array. Array wells contain sets of primers designed specifically to
amplify sequences internal to the PCR products generated during the first stage PCR reaction.
The 2nd stage PCR, or nested PCR, is performed in singleplex fashion in each well of the array.
At the conclusion of the 2nd stage PCR, the array is interrogated by melt curve analysis for the
detection of signature amplicons denoting the presence of specific targets. A digital camera
placed in front of the 2nd stage PCR captures fluorescent images of the PCR reactions
and software interprets the data.
The FilmArray Software automatically interprets the results of each DNA melt curve analysis
and combines the data with the results of the internal pouch controls to provide a test result for
each organism on the panel.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A multi-center study was performed to evaluate the reproducibility of analyte detection on
the FilmArray 2.0 and FilmArray Torch systems. The study incorporated potential variation
introduced by site (three), day (five), operator (at least two per site), system/module, and
reagent kit lot (three). The contrived samples contained representative isolates of aerobic and
anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, AMR genes, and yeast in simulated
blood culture matrix. Each organism was present in a sample at a concentration consistent
with what is observed in a positive blood culture (at positive bottle indication or up to 24
hours after positive bottle indication). Negative results were obtained from samples that were
not spiked with the organism or AMR gene.
Each of the three sites tested 20 replicates per sample and system for a total of 120 valid runs
per sample and 720 valid runs overall. A summary of the reproducibility of results (percent
(%) agreement with the expected Detected, Not Detected or N/A result) for each analyte (by
site and system) is provided in Table 1.

Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
The analytical reactivity of BioFire BCID2 Panel assays was assessed via a combination of in
silico analysis of sequences available in public databases and testing of over 450 isolates
representing the genetic, geographic, and temporal diversity of species, subspecies, and AMR
gene types detected by the panel. Isolates were tested in triplicate at concentrations near LoD
in simulated blood culture matrix.
Results for each isolate tested as well as in silico reactivity predictions for species or AMR
gene types that were not tested are shown in Table 2 – Table 44. For isolates that were not
detected at the initial near-LoD concentration, additional testing was performed at higher
concentrations and the approximate concentration where detection was observed is indicated.
In most cases, the detected concentration was equal to or less than the concentration expected
in a positive blood culture. Alternately, a Not Detected result is indicated if the isolate was
not detected at a concentration equivalent to a positive blood culture level. Additional
limitations on reactivity predicted by in silico sequence analysis are noted.

b Described as Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii.
Analytical Specificity (Cross-Reactivity and Exclusivity)
The potential for non-specific amplification and detection by the BioFire BCID2 Panel
assays was evaluated by in silico analysis of available sequences and by testing of high
concentrations of on-panel and off-panel organisms. Each organism was tested in triplicate
with most bacteria tested at a concentration >1.0E+09 CFU/mL and most yeast tested at a
concentration >1.0E+08 CFU/mL. Off-panel fungi, viruses, and parasites were tested at the
highest cultured concentration possible.
The on-panel organisms tested to assess the potential for intra-panel cross-reactivity are listed
in Table 45, with each observed or predicted cross-reactivity indicated. The off-panel
organisms tested are listed in Table 46 and the list includes species genetically related to
organisms or AMR genes detected by the panel (same genus or otherwise related) as well as
unrelated organisms that may be found in blood and/or blood cultures as pathogens or
contaminants (e.g. skin microorganisms, viruses, etc.). Off-panel AMR genes were also
evaluated, and all observed or predicted cross-reactivities are indicated. Erroneous results
due to cross-reactivity with organisms that were not evaluated or due to cross-reactivity with
emerging or novel sequences are also possible.

Interference
Potentially interfering substances that could be present in blood culture specimens were
evaluated for their effect on BioFire BCID2 Panel performance. The substances tested
included endogenous blood components (e.g. albumin, gamma-globulin, human genomic
DNA), exogenous substances (e.g. prescribed or over-the-counter medications, blood
anticoagulants, substances used to decontaminate or disinfect work areas, etc.), potentially
competing commensal or infectious microorganisms, and various bottle/culture media.
Each substance was added to contrived samples containing representative panel organisms at
concentrations near LoD (at least 10-fold lower than organism concentrations in a positive
blood culture). The concentration of the substances or competing microorganisms added to
the samples was equal to or greater than the highest level expected be in a blood culture.
Valid and accurate results were obtained for each sample containing endogenous and
exogenous substances as well as various anticoagulants and disinfectants at the
concentrations indicated in Table 47.

Mixed Culture Study (Microbial interference):
A study was performed to evaluate potential competitive inhibition or microbial interference
on the BioFire BCID2 Panel. In Table 48, some polymicrobial blood culture samples contained
high levels of a pathogenic or contaminating microorganism as well as low levels of another
microorganism (e.g. a slower-growing yeast). A high level of on-panel or off-panel
microorganism was added to contrived samples containing low levels (near LoD) of on-panel
bacteria or yeast in order to assess the risk for interference that may result.

Study results demonstrated that high concentrations of the on-panel BioFire BCID2
microorganisms spiked into blood culture samples produced positive results for the relevant
assays on the BCID2 Panel but did not interfere with any expected results for other analytes.
Testing of Additional Blood Culture Bottle Types
The BioFire BCID2 Panel was tested for compatibility with thirteen different blood culture
bottle types. Approximately 35 different bacterial or yeast isolates were each mixed with
human whole blood (acid citrate dextrose anticoagulant), seeded directly into a blood culture
bottle (≤300 CFU/bottle), and incubated for growth in a continuous monitoring blood culture
system (or standard incubator for the VersaTREK bottles) until indicated as positive for growth
(i.e., bottle ring). For each positive bottle (note that some isolates did not grow to positivity in
every bottle type), the sample was tested with the BioFire BCID2 Panel and was plate
enumerated to determine the concentration of organism in the bottle. Samples were collected,
tested, and enumerated within one hour of positive bottle indication and at 24 hours after
positive bottle indication (+24h). The results are presented in the table below:

The following internal controls are included in each BioFire BCID2 Panel pouch:
• DNA Process Control: The DNA Process Control assay targets a DNA transcript
from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The yeast is present in the pouch in a
freeze-dried form and becomes rehydrated when sample is loaded. The control
material is carried through all stages of the test process, including lysis, nucleic acid
purification, reverse transcription, PCR1, dilution, PCR2, and DNA melting. A
positive control result indicates that all steps carried out in the BioFire BCID2 Panel
pouch were successful.
• PCR2 Control: The PCR2 Control assay detects a DNA target that is dried into the
wells of the array along with the corresponding primers. A positive result indicates
that the 2nd stage PCR was successful.
Both control assays must be positive for the test run to pass. If the controls fail, the sample
should be retested using a new pouch. Table 51 below provides additional information for
each of the possible control field results.

External controls are not provided with the BCID2 Panel but are recommended in the
package insert.
External Controls should be used in accordance with laboratory protocols and the appropriate
accrediting organization requirements, as applicable. Molecular grade water or saline can be
used as an external negative control. Previously characterized positive samples or negative
samples spiked with well-characterized organisms can be used as external positive controls.

Specimen Stability
Testing with the BioFire BCID2 Panel should be performed as soon as possible after a blood
culture specimen is signaled as positive by a continuous monitoring instrument. As blood
culture bottles are sometimes not removed from the instrument immediately (e.g., when
microbiology laboratories are closed at night), testing of positive specimens is indicated up to
24 hours after bottle ring in the blood culture system or kept at room temperature for up to 24
hours (15-25 °C) after positivity. Testing with BCID2 Panel is indicated for both time
frames. A "Growth and Detection" study was performed to validate the performance of the
BCID2 Panel when testing immediately after bottle positivity and testing after incubation for
an additional 24 hours.
6. Detection Limit:
A limit of detection (LoD) was established for the bacteria and yeast detected by the BioFire
BCID2 Panel. Contrived samples of representative isolates were prepared at a known
concentration in a simulated blood culture matrix consisting of human whole blood incubated
with blood culture media. LoD was estimated by serial dilution and confirmed by testing at
least twenty replicates on the FilmArray 2.0 and FilmArray Torch systems. Confirmation of
LoD required detection in at least 95% of replicates tested and the confirmed LoD
concentrations are listed in Table 52. Testing also confirmed that each AMR gene can be
detected at the LoD concentration of the applicable bacteria with which it may be reported.
LoD concentrations are approximately 30 - 200,000-fold lower than the concentrations
measured in positive blood cultures.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The BioFire Blood Culture Identification 2 (BCID2) Panel is part of BioFire Diagnostics’
(BFDX) FilmArray system. The FilmArray (FA) system is designed to interpret the test data
and automatically report the test results to the operator. The FA system uses the results of the
Melt Detector to determine each test result. The Melt Detector is part of the FilmArray
Analysis Software and assigns a positive or negative result to each reaction on the array
through analysis of the melt data collected during the test. These positive and negative results

are combined in the FilmArray Analysis Software (using the replicate, assay and
interpretation rules) to report the presence or absence of each pathogen in the panel.
The purpose of this study was to validate the use of this Melt Detector with current
optimization parameters with the BioFire BCID2 Panel. To evaluate the Melt Detector
performance, the observed sensitivity and specificity rates for the individual melt curves and
assay calls are reported. These sensitivity and specificity rates are determined by comparing
the FilmArray test results obtained from well-characterized samples, collected as part of the
clinical evaluation and analytic testing of the BCID2 panel, to expert annotation. Annotations
(positive and negative calls) for all melt curves and assay calls were determined by the
sponsor.
For individual melt curves, the observed sensitivity and specificity, as compared to expert
annotation, of the Melt Detector is 99.63% and 99.81%, respectively. For the Analysis
Software, the observed sensitivity and specificity, as compared to the expert annotation, of
the assay calls are greater than 99.53% for sensitivity and 99.83% specificity. The validation
results met the predefined acceptance criteria of >95% accuracy as compared to expert
annotation.

The clinical performance of the Biofire BCID2 Panel was established with a prospective
multi-center study that was further supplemented with archived and seeded positive blood
culture (PBC) specimens.
Blood culture bottle types evaluated in the prospective clinical study included 11 different
media from two different manufacturers as shown in Table 53. Equivalent performance was
observed when results from the different media were compared; therefore, the data collected
from all media types are combined for all analyses.

b Bacteroides fragilis only
Nine geographically distinct study sites (seven in the US and two in the EU) participated in
the prospective clinical evaluation from October 2018 to May 2019. A total of 11 pouch lots
were used for testing.
A total of 1093 residual PBC specimens were acquired for the prospective clinical study. At
two of the US sites, 69 specimens enrolled between October 2018 and February 2019 were
collected and immediately frozen for later testing at the source laboratory. The remaining
1024 specimens were collected and tested fresh. No difference in performance was observed
when fresh and frozen specimen results were compared. Therefore, the data collected from
69 valid frozen specimens are combined with data from the valid 1005 fresh specimens for
all analyses.
Nineteen (19) specimens were excluded from the final data analysis. The most common
reason for specimen exclusion was that the specimen was found to not meet the inclusion
criteria after the specimen has been enrolled, most often due to the specimen being tested

The results from all three clinical studies are summarized for each organism in Table 62
through Table 74. Performance is based on comparison of the BioFire BCID2 Panel results to
the results from comparator methods for prospective specimens (Table 54), the confirmed
analyte of interest for archived specimens, and to the known analyte composition for seeded
specimens. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) or Sensitivity for each analyte was calculated
as 100% × (TP / (TP + FN)). True positive (TP) indicates that both the BioFire BCID2 Panel
and the comparator method (or known analyte composition) had a positive result for the
specific analyte, and false negative (FN) indicates that the BioFire BCID2 Panel was
negative while the comparator result was positive. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) or

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene results are reported only when one or more applicable
bacteria that may carry the gene are also detected in the sample. If no applicable bacteria are
detected, the AMR gene results are reported as Not Applicable (N/A). The results are
summarized for each AMR gene in Table 79 through Table 108. Note: the “Performance
Summary” Tables below do not include specimens for which a potential host organism was not
reported (i.e. the AMR gene was reported as N/A); these specimens are instead accounted for in
the “Distribution of Clinical Specimens” Tables below.

The nature of the seven discrepant results for mecA/C and MREJ (MRSA) between the BioFire
BCID2 Panel and the reference method (Cepheid Xpert MRSA/SA BC) was investigated using
various methods. As shown in Table 102, all S. aureus isolates recovered from the five false
negative (FN) specimens were negative for the mecA/C genes by PCR/sequencing and had a
methicillin sensitive antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) phenotype, indicating MSSA
rather than MRSA. From three of these specimens, the laboratory also isolated a coagulase
negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) that was methicillin resistant (i.e. carrying the mecA or mecC
gene). Three of the five FN specimens were reported as SA (negative for MRSA) by the Cepheid
Xpert MRSA/SA BC test when residual specimen was retested.
Similarly, S. aureus isolates from both false positive (FP) specimens were positive for the
mecA/C genes by PCR/sequencing and had a methicillin resistant AST phenotype. Additionally,
one of the specimens had a result of MRSA when retested by the Cepheid Xpert MRSA/SA BC
test (Table 97).
In all cases, the BioFire BCID2 Panel mecA/C and MREJ (MRSA) results (Detected or Not
Detected) were concordant with the AST phenotype of the S. aureus isolated from the blood
culture, including instances where methicillin resistant CoNS were also present in the specimen.

a Seeded testing not performed for vanA/B.
For prospective specimens only, correlation of the AMR gene results reported in the
specimen by the BCID2 Panel to identification of the gene in the cultured isolates from that
particular specimen was assessed using one polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay followed
by bidirectional sequencing, performed directly on the isolate. The results are shown only for
isolates recovered from specimens with true positive results (i.e. concordant results between
BCID2 Panel and culture), and further stratified by each applicable host organism recovered
from that specimen. There were no observations by either the BioFire BCID2 Panel or the
reference/comparator methods for IMP, OXA-48-like, and mcr-1; therefore, performance
Tables are not shown for these analytes. Performance for the remaining analytes is presented
in Table 109 through Table 112.

antimicrobial resistance phenotype. Additionally, discordant results between mecA/C
detection in a blood culture specimen by the BioFire BCID2 Panel and the observed
methicillin (oxacillin/cefoxitin) resistance of cultured Staphylococcus isolates may be due to
polymicrobial Staphylococcus cultures containing a mixture of resistant and sensitive

The overall success rate for initial specimen tests in all three clinical studies was 99.4%
(2042/2055). Eight tests (8/2055; 0.4%) did not complete on the initial test attempt, resulting
in an instrument success rate of 99.6% (2047/2055) for initial specimen tests. Seven of the
eight specimens were able to be retested and valid results were produced after a single retest.
Of the 2047 tests that successfully produced a completed run on the initial test, 2042 had
valid pouch controls. This represents a 99.8% (2042/2047) success rate for pouch controls in
completed runs in the initial specimen tests. The five specimens with invalid control(s) were
able to be retested and valid results were produced on the first retest.
