C Type of Test:
Quantitative immunoturbidimetric assays
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Yumizen C1200 Immunoglobulin A reagent is intended for the quantitative in vitro diagnostic
determination of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) in serum and lithium heparin plasma by
immunoturbidimetry on Yumizen analyzers. Measurement of this immunoglobulin aids in the
diagnosis of abnormal protein metabolism and the body’s lack of ability to resist infectious
agents. This test should be used in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.
Yumizen C1200 Immunoglobulin G reagent is intended for the quantitative in vitro diagnostic
determination of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in serum and lithium heparin plasma by
immunoturbidimetry on Yumizen analyzers. Measurement of this immunoglobulin aids in the
diagnosis of abnormal protein metabolism and the body’s lack of ability to resist infectious
agents. This test should be used in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.
Yumizen C1200 Immunoglobulin M reagent is intended for the quantitative in vitro diagnostic
determination of Immunoglobulin M (IgM) in serum and lithium heparin plasma by
immunoturbidimetry on Yumizen analyzers. Measurement of this immunoglobulin aids in the
diagnosis of abnormal protein metabolism and the body’s lack of ability to resist infectious
agents. This test should be used in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Yumizen C1200 IgM:
• Reagent 1: TRIS buffer solution
• Reagent 2: Goat anti-human IgM antibodies in TRIS buffer
All assays’ calibrators and control materials are sold separately.
B Principle of Operation:
These immunoturbidimetric assays measure increasing sample turbidity caused by the formation
of insoluble immune complexes when goat anti-human immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG, or IgM)
antibodies are bound to the specific immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG, or IgM) in the sample. The IgA,
IgG, or IgM concentration is proportional to the amount of turbidity formed.

Linearity: Linearity of the Yumizen C1200 IgA assay was assessed according to CLSI
EP06-A. A high concentration IgA-spiked human serum sample and an IgA-depleted
serum were used to create a dilution series covering above and below the measuring
range. Sample dilutions were assayed in quadruplicate within a single run and samples
within the measuring range were used to determine linearity:

21–660 y=1.027x–0.004 1.012–1.043 -0.060–0.051 0.998
Auto-rerun validation study: An auto-rerun study was performed to evaluate the accuracy
of the analyzer’s auto dilution function to obtain results for IgA samples with analyte
concentrations above the primary measuring range (700 mg/dL). Seven samples were
used for the study, ranging from 715–1988 mg/dL. Each sample was manually diluted
with a 1:3 ratio. The automatic instrument dilutions and the manual dilutions were
measured in quadruplicates. The results of the auto-rerun study support the claim that
samples having concentrations up to 2100 mg/dL can be run via the rerun function which
uses a 1:3 dilution.
Prozone effect: The potential for a prozone effect was evaluated for the IgA assay.
Testing elevated samples did not indicate a prozone effect with concentrations up to 2320
mg/dL.

mg/dL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
For all three assays, the effect of the presence of endogenous and exogenous interferents in
samples was evaluated by testing native unmodified serum pools at two analyte levels
(normal and high) with a range of concentrations of the substances listed below. Each
sample was tested at four concentrations of interferent and with an interferent-free control in
four replicates each. The percent recovery for each sample spiked with the interference
substance was calculated by comparing its result to that of the corresponding reference
sample spiked with an equal volume of the solvent without the interference substance. No
interference was observed up to the following concentration of each interference substance
for each assay.
Interferent (mg/dL) IgA IgG IgM
Hemoglobin 500.0 500.0 250.0
Triglycerides 531.1 456.8 520.6
Total Bilirubin 29.2 39.0 27.9

Acetylsalicylic Acid 65.2 65.2 65.2
Ibuprofen 50.1 50.1 50.1
Acetaminophen 20.0 20.0 20.0

Stability:
Real-time shelf-life stability testing supports a shelf-life for unopened reagents stored at the
labeling recommendation (2–8°C). On-board reagent stability studies support the claims that
the reagents can be stored on board the Yumizen C1200. The results are summarized below:
Stability Claims IgA IgG IgM
Reagent Shelf-life 24 months 24 months 24 months

*Sample stability claims in the package insert cite published references. The package labeling
states a sample should be frozen only once.
6. Detection Limit:
The detection limits of all three assays were performed according to CLSI EP17-A2. The
Limit of Blank (LoB) corresponds to the concentration below which analyte-free samples are
found with a probability of 95%. The Limit of Detection (LoD) is determined based on the
limit of blank and the standard deviation of low concentration samples. The limit of detection
corresponds to the lowest analyte concentration which can be detected (value above the limit
of blank with a probability of 95%). The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was defined as the
lowest analyte concentration which can be quantified with a total error of ≤ 20%.
Yumizen C1200 IgA:
LoB:
The LoB of the IgA assay was determined by assaying one IgA-depleted sample in five
replicates per day for four days on three Yumizen instruments. A total of 60 data points

separately. The LoB was defined as the higher value, 0.5 mg/dL.
LoD:
The LoD of the IgA assay was determined by testing four low analyte samples in
quadruplicate for four days on one instrument. A total of 64 data points per lot were
