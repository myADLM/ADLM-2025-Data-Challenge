C Type of Test:
Competitive Chemiluminescent Immunoassay
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The LIAISON® Anti-HAV assay is an in vitro chemiluminescent immunoassay intended for the
qualitative detection of total antibodies to hepatitis A (anti-HAV) in human serum and sodium
heparin plasma samples using the LIAISON® Analyzer family. The assay is indicated as an aid
in the laboratory diagnosis of current or previous HAV infections in conjunction with other
serological and clinical information and to determine the presence of an antibody response to
HAV in vaccine recipients.
This assay is not intended for screening blood or solid or soft tissue donors.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use with the LIAISON, LIAISON XL, or the LIAISON XS Analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The LIAISON Anti-HAV assay is an in vitro chemiluminescent immunoassay intended for the
qualitative detection of total antibodies to hepatitis A (anti-HAV) in human serum and sodium
heparin plasma samples using the LIAISON Analyzer family. No changes were made to the
assay to run it on the LIAISON XS Analyzer (see K082049, K103529).
B Principle of Operation:
The LIAISON Anti-HAV assay is a competitive sandwich chemiluminescence immunoassay
(CLIA) based on neutralization. The assay uses magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with IgG
antibodies to HAV (mouse monoclonal), and a mouse monoclonal anti-HAV antibody conjugate
linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate). The first incubation step
consists of adding the HAV antigen to calibrators, samples or controls, during which anti-HAV
present in calibrators, samples or controls binds to a fixed and limited amount of HAV, thus
forming an HAV-anti-HAV immune complex. In the next step magnetic microparticles and
conjugate are added into the cuvette. During this incubation the antibody conjugate and the solid-
phase antibody compete with anti-HAV present in the specimen for HAV which allows the
K193532 - Page 2 of 7

--- Page 3 ---
conjugate to bind to the solid phase and form a sandwich. If all HAV added is sequestered in an
HAV-anti-HAV immune complex during the first incubation, no sandwich is formed during the
second incubation. After the second incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash
cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is
induced. The light signal, proportional to the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is
measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is inversely relative to the anti-
HAV present in samples, calibrators, or controls.
The LIAISON XS Analyzer is a benchtop, automated, closed, continuous samples and reagents-
loading in vitro diagnostic immunoassay system utilizing chemiluminescent technology to
provide rapid sample results. The LIAISON XS Analyzer has the same basic design,
performance characteristics, intended use, and function as the LIAISON XL Analyzer,
employing the same chemiluminescent reaction measurement technology and Reagent Integrals.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility/precision study was conducted at two external laboratories and at DiaSorin
Inc. (Stillwater, Minnesota 55082-0285, U.S.A.) to verify the precision of the LIAISON XS
Analyzer with the LIAISON XS Anti-HAV Assay.
A coded panel comprised of 7 frozen serum samples was distributed to the testing sites. The
coded panel samples were prepared by pooling samples with similar anti-HAV titers in order
to represent negative, borderline and positive levels. The LIAISON Anti-HAV controls were
also included in the twelve-day study. The coded panel was tested at all three sites, in a
single run, four replicates per day, with one reagent lot, at least two operators per site, for 12
days.
The mean Index value, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (%CV) of the results
were computed for each of the tested specimens for each of the sites and across sites.

An analytical sensitivity study was performed using a secondary standard titrated against the
WHO International Standard for Anti-Hepatitis A, Immunoglobulin, Human. The study was
performed to demonstrate that the minimum level of analyte detected was comparable
between the assay run on the LIAISON XL vs on the LIAISON XS. Results obtained from
serial dilutions of the secondary standard tested with the LIAISON Anti-HAV on the
LIAISON XS were plotted. The concentration at the assay cutoff, corresponding to the assay
analytical sensitivity, was calculated by interpolation and the mean value obtained was 18
mIU/mL. The result fell within the acceptance range of 15.5 – 21.5 mIU/mL, which is the
same criteria for the assay on the LIAISON XL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A Method Comparison study was conducted to demonstrate equivalent performance of the
LIAISON Anti-HAV assay when run on either the LIAISON XL or the LIAISON XS
analyzer. The study consisted of testing 100 frozen serum samples on the LIAISON XS and
the LIAISON XL Analyzers with the LIAISON Anti-HAV Assay. The samples were either
selected or prepared by DiaSorin Inc. to reach different levels of anti-HAV antibody.
The samples were randomly divided among 3 sites (2 external and 1 internal) for testing,
with testing on the LIAISON XL Analyzer performed internally at DiaSorin Inc.
