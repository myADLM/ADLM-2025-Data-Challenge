III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
MicroScan Dried Gram Negative MIC/Combo Panels are designed for use in determining
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of
rapidly growing aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The MicroScan Dried Gram Negative MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine quantitative and/or
qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of rapidly
growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. After inoculation, panels are
incubated for 16-20 hours at 35 degrees C +/- 1 degree centigrade in a non-CO incubator, and
2
read either visually or with MicroScan instrumentation, according to the Package Insert.
This particular submission is for updated susceptibility test interpretive criteria for
Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as expanding Salmonella ser. Typhi
interpretive criteria to all Salmonella spp. for the antimicrobial ciprofloxacin (Cp) at
concentrations of 0.004 to 8 ug/mL to the test panel.
Ciprofloxacin has been shown to be active in vitro against most strains of microorganisms listed
below, as described in the FDA-approved package insert for this antimicrobial agent.
Active in vitro and in clinical infections against:
Citrobacter koseri
Citrobacter freundii
Enterobacter cloacae
Escherichia coli
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Morganella morganii
Proteus mirabilis
Providencia rettgeri
Providencia stuartii
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Salmonella ser. Typhi
Serratia marcescens
Shigella flexneri
Shigella sonnei
Active in vitro but clinical significance is unknown:
Enterobacter aerogenes
Klebsiella oxytoca
Salmonella enteritidis
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
K193536 - Page 2 of 16

--- Page 3 ---
The ability of the MicroScan Dried Gram Negative Panels to detect resistance to ciprofloxacin is
unknown for the following species because an insufficient number of resistant strains were
available at the time of comparative testing: C. koseri, P vulgaris, Shigella sonnei and
Salmonella enteritidis. Isolates yielding MIC results suggestive of a resistant interpretive
category should be submitted to a reference laboratory.
Results obtained with ciprofloxacin and E. cloacae with all read methods/Prompt, E. aerogenes
with WalkAway/Prompt and manual/Prompt, S. sonnei with manual/Prompt and S. marcescens
with the autoSCAN-4/Prompt and manual/Prompt have shown discrepant MICs when compared
with the reference method. If critical to patient care, isolates of those species should be retested
using the turbidity inoculation method. In addition, discrepant MICs were observed with
ciprofloxacin and C. koseri with turbidity/manual read; if critical to patient care, isolates of C.
koseri should be tested with an alternate inoculation/read method.
Due to low categorical agreement and increased occurrence of very major errors for P.
aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin with the autoSCAN-4 and Prompt inoculation, results should be
confirmed by manual read prior to reporting.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
MicroScan panels can be read either manually or automatically on the WalkAway or autoScan-4
instrument systems.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo panel with ciprofloxacin is used to determine
the quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of aerobic and facultatively
anaerobic gram-negative bacilli colonies grown on solid media. After inoculation, panels are
incubated for 16-20 hours at 35°C ± 1° in a non-CO incubator and read either visually or with
2
MicroScan instrumentation according to the package insert.
Inoculation methods: Turbidity or Prompt Inoculation System
Read methods: Manual, MicroScan WalkAway System and MicroScan autoSCAN-4
B Principle of Operation:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are dehydrated miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in Mueller Hinton broth
supplemented with calcium and magnesium to concentrations spanning the range of clinical
interest. Breakpoint Combo panels use concentrations equivalent to the categorical breakpoints
determined or recognized by FDA. After inoculation and rehydration with a standardized
suspension of organism and incubation at 35°C for a minimum of 16 hours, the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is determined by observing the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.

3. CLSI M100. Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. 29th ed.
(January 2019)
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external sites using 12 isolates of gram-
negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. The range of ciprofloxacin
dilutions tested was 0.004-8 µg/mL. Isolates were tested in triplicate over three days for a
total of 324 data points (27 data points per isolate). The isolates tested in the reproducibility
study included: C. freundii complex (1 isolate), C. koseri (1 isolate), E. cloacae (1 isolate), E.
coli (2 isolates), K. oxytoca (2 isolates), K. pneumoniae (2 isolates), S. marcescens (1
isolate), Salmonella ser. Typhi (1 isolate) and P. aeruginosa (1 isolate).
Inocula were prepared using both the turbidity and Prompt methods and results were read
manually (visually) and with the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 instrument systems. The
majority of data points were within ± one doubling dilution of the mode MIC value. The data
was analyzed as described in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. Because results from all sites were all on-
scale, only a single combined reproducibility result is reported for each read method.
The reproducibility results are acceptable and are shown in Table 2 below.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Inoculum Density Check. A spectrophotometric device, the MicroScan Turbidity Meter,
was used to ensure the accuracy of the turbidity inoculation method. A zero check of the
turbidity meter was performed daily. The inocula prepared using the turbidity method were
standardized using a reading of 0.08 ± 0.02 (equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland barium sulfate
turbidity standard). The digital reading was recorded for each isolate and was considered
acceptable based on recommendations in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. Inoculum density colony counts were
evaluated from suspensions of the QC strain E. coli ATCC 25922 and were found to be
within the acceptable concentration range as recommended in the CLSI document M07,
Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow Aerobically.
Inoculum density data for the Prompt inoculation system was collected from suspensions of
the QC strain E. coli ATCC 25922 and for all reproducibility isolates. The overall average
colony count was within the acceptable range for all isolates.
Purity Check. Purity checks were performed on all isolates for each inoculum preparation;
only results from pure cultures were included.
Growth Failure Rate. All organisms evaluated showed growth on the dried test panels.
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI-recommended QC organisms E. coli ATCC 25922 and
P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were tested with all inoculation and read methods using 12
dilutions of ciprofloxacin (0.004 – 8 µg/mL). The reference panel was inoculated using the
turbidity method only. In this submission the QC range for both E. coli ATCC 25922 and P.
aeruginosa ATCC 27853 reflect the current MIC ranges recommended in the CLSI
document M100, Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing 29th ed.
For both QC strains, quality control results were within the acceptable range for all
inoculation and read methods. Results of current QC testing are shown in Table 3 below and
demonstrate that acceptable QC results can be obtained with this device for >95% of tests.

performed to demonstrate the equivalence between reference panels inoculated with
organisms suspended in water supplemented with Pluronic-F and reference panels inoculated
with autoclaved deionized water without Pluronic-F as part of studies performed for
K172912, MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panels with Ciprofloxacin-S
(0.004-8 µg/mL).The effect of Pluronic-F in the reference panel was determined with 11
Salmonella ser.Typhi isolates; performance was determined to be acceptable
For the reference method and MicroScan panels inoculated using the turbidity method,
panels were inoculated using the same standardized suspension further diluted into 25 mL of
water with Pluronic-D (for the MicroScan panels) or Pluronic-F (for the frozen reference
panels). MicroScan panels were also inoculated using the Prompt inoculation method with
isolates inoculated into the Prompt inoculation bottle. Reference panels were read manually
(visually); MicroScan panels inoculated with both inoculation methods were read using the
WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 instruments and by manual read.
Clinical Isolates
To determine the performance of the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel
with Ciprofloxacin, a total of 604 non-Salmonella Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were
evaluated with all inoculation and read methods at three sites; 543 of the isolates were from
indicated species which included the following: C. freundii (12 isolates), C. koseri (49
isolates), K. aerogenes (32 isolates), E. cloacae (48 isolates), E. coli (77 isolates), K. oxytoca
(47 isolates), K. pneumoniae (89 isolates), M. morganii (41 isolates), P. mirabilis (56
isolates), P. vulgaris (17 isolates), P. rettgeri (19 isolates), P. stuartii (21 isolates), S.
marcescens (32 isolates), S. flexneri (1 isolate), and S. sonnei (2 isolates). An additional 61
isolates of non-indicated Enterobacteriaceae isolates (approximately 10% of the total
number of isolates tested) were also evaluated. The addition of the non-indicated species
impacted but did not improve the performance calculated using indicated species alone.
A total of 19 clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. were evaluated including S. enteritidis (6
isolates), and Salmonella spp. (13 isolates).
A total of 79 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were evaluated with an appropriate mix of
fresh isolates and recent isolates.
The clinical isolates evaluated represented an appropriate mix of fresh isolates (tested within
one week of isolation), recent isolates (tested within six months of isolation with minimal
subculturing and stock isolates (tested at any time after isolation).
Challenge isolates
A total of 85 Enterobacteriaceae challenge isolates were evaluated at one site. These
included: C. koseri, K. aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. coli, K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, M.
morganii, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, S. marcescens, S. flexneri, S. sonnei and 5 isolates of non-
indicated species. In addition, two Salmonella ser. Typhi and 14 P. aeruginosa challenge
isolates were evaluated. A single isolate of S. flexneri was excluded from the analysis of
performance of the WalkAway read method due to the lack of results for this method.
Results for EA, CA and categorical errors for Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella spp. and P.
aeruginosa for all inoculation and read methods are shown in Tables 4 and 5 below. Overall
K193536 - Page 8 of 16

--- Page 9 ---
results for Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella spp. and P. aeruginosa with all inoculation and
read methods were acceptable.
Salmonella spp. results were evaluated separately from Enterobacteriaceae due to
differences in susceptibility test interpretive criteria. In addition to the 21 clinical and
challenge isolates of Salmonella spp. that were tested in this study, the previously cleared
submission, K172912 was referenced to expand the evaluation of the performance of
ciprofloxacin with Salmonella spp. Performance obtained with 74 isolates of Salmonella ser.
Typhi evaluated with ciprofloxacin in K172912 (100% EA and CA for all inoculation and
read methods) were considered in the evaluation of ciprofloxacin performance with members
of this genus. The overall EA and CA performance for Salmonella spp. tested in the current
study was acceptable for each inoculation and read method (Tables 4 and 5) and there were
no major or very major errors. Based on the acceptable performance of ciprofloxacin for
Salmonella species in these two submissions, the following previously imposed limitation (in
K172912) was removed from the labeling associated with the current submission:
Ciprofloxacin labeled as Cp-S is not indicated for use for any species other than Salmonella
Typhi.

EA – Essential agreement S – Susceptible
EVAL – Evaluable isolates min – minor discrepancies
CA – Category agreement maj – major discrepancies
R – Resistant vmj – very major discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) occurs when the result of the reference method and that of the MicroScan
Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel are within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the
antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the reference method and the
MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel. Category agreement (CA) occurs when the
interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation provided by
the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel.

No results recorded for one challenge isolate of Shigella flexneri with WalkAway see above
For C. koseri, P. vulgaris, S. sonnei and Salmonella enteritidis, no resistant isolates were
available for evaluation during clinical or challenge testing. The sponsor included the
following limitation in the device labeling:
The ability of the MicroScan Dried Gram Negative Panels to detect resistance to
ciprofloxacin is unknown for the following species because an insufficient number of
resistant strains were available at the time of comparative testing: C. koseri, P vulgaris,
Shigella sonnei and Salmonella enteritidis. Isolates yielding MIC results suggestive of a
resistant interpretive category should be submitted to a reference laboratory.
For tests inoculated using the Prompt Inoculation System, E. cloacae showed low essential
agreement with all read methods, K. (Enterobacter) aerogenes showed low essential
agreement with the WalkAway and Manual read method, S. sonnei showed low EA and CA
(due to minor errors) and S. marcescens showed low essential agreement with the
autoSCAN-4 and manual read methods. In addition, isolates of C. koseri inoculated with the
turbidity inoculation method and read manually showed low essential agreement as
compared to the reference method. The sponsor included the following limitation in the
device labeling:

Results obtained with ciprofloxacin and E. cloacae with all read methods/Prompt, E.
aerogenes with WalkAway/Prompt and manual/Prompt, S. sonnei with manual/Prompt
and S. marcescens with the autoSCAN-4/Prompt and manual/Prompt have shown
discrepant MICs when compared with the reference method. If critical to patient care,
isolates of those species should be retested using the turbidity inoculation method. In
addition, discrepant MICs were observed with ciprofloxacin and C. koseri with
turbidity/manual read; if critical to patient care, isolates of C. koseri should be tested
with an alternate inoculation/read method.
P. aeruginosa was observed to have lowered categorical agreement and an elevated very
major error rate with the autoSCAN-4 read method and both turbidity and Prompt
inoculation method during the initial clinical and challenge testing. Additional testing with P.
aeruginosa challenge isolates was reviewed (29 isolates tested with Prompt and
turbidity/auto-SCAN-4 and manual read methods, 23 isolates tested with Prompt and
turbidity/WalkAway). Results of the original clinical and challenge testing combined with
the additional challenge testing showed improved categorical agreement and very major error
rate with turbidity inoculation and autoSCAN-4; an elevated very major error rate remained
with Prompt/autoSCAN-4 (Table 6 below). The sponsor included the following limitation in
the device labeling:
Due to low categorical agreement and increased occurrence of very major errors for P.
aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin with the autoSCAN-4 and Prompt inoculation, results
should be confirmed by manual read prior to reporting.

Trending
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data for
each organism group and for each inoculation and read method. This trending calculation
takes into account MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilution lower
or higher compared to the reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values
are on scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution
higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the
trending analysis.
Trending results for indicated species were evaluated to determine if species-specific trends
were observed. Species or organism groups for which the difference between the percentage
of isolates with higher vs. lower readings was >30% and for which the confidence interval
was determined to be statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending.
Trending that provides higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in
labeling. Trending calculations for ciprofloxacin with Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella spp.,
P. aeruginosa and species for which trending was observed are shown in Table 7 below.
To address the observed trending the sponsor included the following footnote to the
performance table in the device labeling:
Ciprofloxacin MIC values for Enterobacteriaceae were most frequently in exact
agreement with the reference method. When not in agreement results tended to be one
doubling dilution higher for: C. freundii (Turbidity/WalkAway and manual read), C.
koseri and Shigella sonnei (Prompt and Turbidity/all read methods), M. morganii
(Prompt/WalkAway and manual read, Turbidity/manual read), Salmonella ser. Typhi
(Prompt/WalkAway and manual read, Turbidity/WalkAway and manual read), and
Salmonella spp. (Turbidity/WalkAway). MIC results for P. rettgeri tended to be one
doubling dilution lower with Prompt and Turbidity inoculation with auto-SCAN-4.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that Beckman Coulter
intends to use to evaluate the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panels with
Ciprofloxacin (Cp) (0.004 – 8 µg/mL) when revised breakpoints for ciprofloxacin are published
on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the submission
indicated that if specific criteria are met, Beckman Coulter will update the ciprofloxacin device
label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-evaluation
of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as
determined by their evaluation.
