CRYOcheck Hex LA is for clinical laboratory use as a qualitative test kit intended to aid in the
detection of lupus anticoagulants (LA) in 3.2% citrated human plasma by the application of
hexagonal phase phospholipids. CRYOcheck Hex LA should be used as an integrated test for
lupus anticoagulant detection. For in vitro diagnostic use. The performance of this device has not
been established in neonate and pediatric patient populations.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
CRYOcheck Hex LA is used to perform a qualitative test for the detection of lupus
anticoagulants and consists of the following three components:
• LA Start: Pooled normal plasma with buffer and a heparin neutralizer
• LA Correct: Pooled normal plasma with buffer, a heparin neutralizer, and inverted
hexagonal phase phospholipid
• LA APTT: Silica-based LA sensitive APTT reagent with stabilizer(s)
B Principle of Operation:
CRYOcheck Hex LA is a hexagonal-phase phospholipid neutralization test (HPNT), which is an
integrated test that combines screening, confirmatory and mixing test procedures into a single
assay. The HPNT works on the principle that lupus anticoagulants (LA) are neutralized by
hexagonal phase phospholipids (PL). The presence of LA in plasma samples is confirmed by the
correction of prolonged APTT clot times in the presence of a reaction mixture containing
hexagonal phase phospholipids.
In the CRYOcheck Hex LA assay, the test plasma suspected to contain LA is incubated in two
reaction cuvettes, both of which involve dilution with pooled normal plasma. In the first cuvette,
the screening test component is performed by mixing the test plasma with the LA Start reagent
(pooled normal plasma with a heparin neutralizer). In the second cuvette, the confirmatory test
component is performed by mixing the test plasma with the LA Correct reagent (pooled normal
plasma with a heparin neutralizer and hexagonal phase phospholipid). The LA APTT reagent is
then added to each cuvette, followed by 0.025 M CaCl2 to activate clotting via the intrinsic
pathway. Clot times are recorded for the reaction mixture containing LA Start (screen) and the
reaction mixture containing LA Correct (confirm). The result is reported as the difference in clot
time in seconds (“delta correction”) between LA Start and LA Correct cuvettes.
Delta Correction = (CT LA Start) – (CT LA Correct)
K193556 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
The result is then compared to an established cutoff. A result greater than or equal to the
established cutoff is considered LA positive, while a result less than the established cutoff is
considered LA negative.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a. Shelf-Life Stability:
Shelf-life stability studies were performed to support the recommended storage and
handling instructions found in the device labeling. Three control samples were tested by
using three lots of CRYOcheck Hex LA after storage in the following temperature ranges
up to 37 months, -70°C (-66 to -72°C) and -80°C (-76 to -82°C). The study was
performed using a single STA-R Evolution instrument with ten replicate measurements at
each time point for each sample. The study data demonstrate that a shelf-life stability
claim of 12 months when stored at -70°C or colder.
b. In-Use Stability:
In-use stability studies were performed to support the recommended storage and handling
instructions found in the device labeling. Three control plasmas and four test plasmas
with varying levels of LA (Negative, Near Cut-off, Weak Positive and Strong Positive)
were tested by using three lots of CRYOcheck Hex LA after storage in the following
conditions, room temperature (18–25°C) or on-board the instrument. The study was
performed using three reagent lots on a STA-R Evolution instrument with five replicate
measurements at each time point for each sample. The in-use stability claim was
established at 4 hours when reagents are maintained at room temperature or 8 hours when
stored on-board the instrument.
c. Sample Stability
Sample stability studies were performed to support the recommended storage and
handling instructions found in the device labeling. Sixty-four citrated plasma samples
were tested after storage in the following temperature ranges, room temperature (15–
25°C) and below -70°C. The study was performed using one reagent lot of CRYOcheck
Hex LA on STA-R Evolution instrument with four replicate measurements at each time
point for each sample. The study data demonstrate that citrated plasma samples are stable
for four hours when stored at room temperature (15–25°C), two months when stored at <-
70°C, including one freeze thaw cycle.
d. Expected Values – Controls

6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable
7. Normal Range and Assay Cut-Off:
The reference interval study was conducted at one laboratory site. The LA level of plasma
samples collected from 137 normal, ostensibly healthy individuals (≥ 18 years) were tested
by two operators using three lots of CRYOcheck Hex LA on a STA-R Evolution instrument.
The reference interval for delta correction was established by calculating the pooled mean ±2
SD. The calculated normal reference range for delta correction results of CRYOcheck Hex
LA is shown in the table below:
Normal Range
Lower Range Upper Range
-5.9 2.0
The cut-off results were determined by using pooled data from the normal range study. The
cut-off is calculated as the mean of the delta correction + 4 SD.
Delta Correction Interpretation
< 6.0 seconds LA Negative
≥ 6.0 seconds LA Positive
This method of establishing cut-off is different than that indicated for confirmatory tests.
Each laboratory should verify its own cut-off, for example, by testing the plasma of at least
20 normal individuals.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison study was conducted using the CRYOcheck Hex LA on the STA-R
Evolution by testing n=446 clinical samples (citrated plasma) collected from the intended use
population. Results from the CRYOcheck Hex LA were compared to results from the
STACLOT LA assay on a STA-R Evolution. The following tables summarize the 95%
confidence intervals for PPA, NPA, and overall agreement were calculated using the
Clopper-Pearson (exact) method.
