The VITEK 2 Gram-Negative Susceptibility Card is intended for use with the VITEK 2 Systems
in clinical laboratories as an in vitro test to determine the susceptibility of clinically significant
aerobic Gram-negative bacilli to antimicrobial agents when used as instructed.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using VITEK 2 Systems Version 9.03 Software
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
K193567 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow the operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. These data are used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GN Polymyxin B has the following concentrations in the card: 0.125, 0.5, 2 and 8
μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The Polymyxin B MIC
result range for the VITEK 2 is ≤ 0.25 to ≥ 16 μg/mL for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The VITEK
2 system is capable of reporting the following MIC results: ≤ 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and ≥ 16 μg/mL
for the AST-Gram Negative Polymyxin B test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period based on the VITEK 2 card), light transmittance
readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is prevented from
passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC values and their
associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an
automatically generated report.

Reproducibility testing was performed on a 10-organism panel at one internal and two
external sites according to the FDA AST Guidance document. Each isolate was tested in
triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. Reproducibility was evaluated for
both the automatic and manual dilution methods for preparation of inocula on the VITEK 2
and the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode of MIC values was determined for each isolate, and
reproducibility was calculated based on the number of MIC values that fell within ±1
doubling dilution of the mode. All data points were on scale, except for 1 result for the
VITEK 2 Automatic Dilution. The reproducibility performance for all three sites was
acceptable with a range of 99.63-100% for the various VITEK instruments and card
inoculation methods.

Quality Control (QC) Testing: The CLSI-recommended QC strains, Escherichia coli ATCC
25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were tested at least 20 times per testing site using
both the VITEK 2 card and broth microdilution (BMD) reference methods. Both the
automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual
dilution method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact.
QC results are summarized in Table 1. The VITEK 2 card for polymyxin B does not include
the full CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution range for QC testing of E. coli ATCC 25922.
Thus, obtaining a result of ≤ 0.25 µg/mL (lowest dilution on the card) was considered as an
indicator that the quality control test results were acceptable. To address this, the sponsor
included the following footnote in the Quality Control section of the device labeling:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Testing of Polymyxin B on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card was performed at three
external sites and one internal site.
There were 304 clinical isolates and 85 challenge isolates tested for a total of 389 isolates.
Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-GN card with Polymyxin B were compared to
results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution reference panel. The MIC result range for
the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Polymyxin B is ≤ 0.25 – ≥ 16 μg/mL. The reference panel
contained two-fold serial dilutions with a range of ≤ 0.06 to ≥ 64 μg/mL. The testing
conditions for the reference method consisted of the following:
• Medium – Cation Adjusted Mueller Hinton Broth
• Inoculum – Direct colony suspension
• Incubation – 35°C for 16 to 20 hours
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test
inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using
the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 304 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates were evaluated. Nine isolates did not grow in
the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Polymyxin B test so complete test results were available
for 295 isolates: 77.6% (229 isolates) were considered contemporary isolates and 25.4% (75
isolates) were stock isolates. The clinical isolates were tested with the auto-dilution option
for the VITEK 2.
A total of 85 challenge P. aeruginosa isolates were evaluated at one external site. The
challenge set was tested with the auto-dilution and manual dilution options for the VITEK 2
and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact.
Clinical and Challenge Data – VITEK 2 Auto-Dilution
The results obtained using the auto-dilution method for the VITEK 2 from the 380 total
tested isolates (295 clinical isolates and 85 challenge isolates) are summarized in Table 2.

MIC Trends
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge isolates)
obtained from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method (Table 4). This trending calculation
analyzes device MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower
or higher than the reference method. MIC values that are off-scale for both the reference and
device are not considered in the trending analysis. A difference between the percentage of
isolates with higher or lower MIC values that is ≥ 30% with a statistically significant
confidence interval is considered to have evidence of trending.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage. The protocol
outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux intends to use to
evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GN Polymyxin B when revised breakpoints for Polymyxin B are
published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the
submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the Polymyxin B
device label to include (1) the new breakpoints; (2) an updated performance section after re-
evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints; and, (3) any new
limitations as determined by their evaluation.
