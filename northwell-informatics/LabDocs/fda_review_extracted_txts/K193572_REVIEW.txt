D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using VITEK 2 Systems 9.03 software
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Imipenem/relebactam has the following concentrations in the
card: 0.25/4, 1/4, 4/4, and 16/4 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in
μg/mL). The imipenem/relebactam MIC result range for the VITEK 2 is ≤0.25/4 to ≥16/4
μg/mL. For P. aeruginosa and all Enterobacteriaceae species, the VITEK 2 system is capable of
reporting the following MIC results: ≤0.25/4, 0.5/4, 1/4, 2/4, 4/4, 8/4 and ≥16/4 μg/mL for the
AST-Gram Negative Imipenem/relebactam test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Imipenem/relebactam was
conducted at three external clinical sites using a panel composed of five Klebsiella
pneumoniae and five P. aeruginosa isolates as representative Gram-negative bacilli
consistent with the indications for use. Each isolate was tested in triplicate over three days for
a total of 270 data points. Inocula were prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual
dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2 System. In addition, inocula were prepared by
the manual dilution method for use with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode of MIC values
was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was calculated based on the number
of MIC values that fell within ±1 doubling dilution of the mode.
There were two off-scale results noted for the auto-dilution method, one off-scale result for
the manual dilution method for the VITEK 2 system and two off-scale results for the VITEK
Compact system. The testing resulted in overall best and worst-case reproducibility of 99.3%
(268/270) for auto-dilution and 99.6% (269/270) for manual dilution in the VITEK 2 System
and 99.3%% (268/270) for the VITEK 2 Compact System (manual dilution only). The
reproducibility data was acceptable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Quality Control (QC) Testing:
The CLSI recommended QC strains, namely K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-1705 and K.
pneumoniae ATCC BAA-2814 were tested a sufficient number of times (i.e., at least 20/site)
at each testing site using both the VITEK 2 card and broth microdilution (BMD) reference
methods. Both the automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK
2 and the manual dilution method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact.
Both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods for VITEK 2 and the manual dilution
for VITEK 2 Compact QC results are summarized in Table 2 below. Obtaining a VITEK
result of ≤ 0.25 μg/mL (lowest dilution on the card) for K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-1705
and K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-2814 was considered as an indicator that the quality control
test results were acceptable. The sponsor included the following footnote in the labeling for
both CLSI QC isolates to indicate that the device does not include the full CLSI/FDA-
recommended dilution range for QC testing:
Does not include the full CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution range for QC testing with this
organism.
Furthermore, the sponsor tested K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-1705 with imipenem alone to
ensure that the plasmid encoding the β-lactamase gene was not lost during testing with the
reference only. Testing of this strain was performed only with VITEK 2 (Auto-dilution)
method. All results were acceptable (Table 3).
Because the VITEK card reporting range (≤0.25/4 - ≥ 16/4 μg/mL) does not include the full
CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution range for QC testing, the sponsor conducted a study to
validate a novel P. aeruginosa (bioMérieux strain 105617 strain which is not included in
CLSI M100 standard) for recommended use as a QC strain for their device.
The validation study included testing of at least 80 replicates on at least two different lots
over two days according to FDA recommendations. Testing was performed with all
inoculation methods used on the VITEK 2 System. Colony counts of the inoculum
suspension verified the organism concentration. Results were within the established range for
K193572 - Page 6 of 12

--- Page 7 ---
≥ 95% of the replicates. The results for this strain are summarized in Table 4 below. The
sponsor established the QC range for this strain at 2-8 μg/mL and recommends that users
obtain this strain from ATCC (strain reference number is currently undetermined) and
routinely test with the imipenem/relebactam test.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Testing of imipenem/relebactam on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card was performed at
three external sites and one internal site. There were 379 clinical isolates and 118 challenge
isolates tested for a total of 497 isolates. Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-Gram
Negative card with imipenem/relebactam were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth
microdilution reference panel. The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative
Imipenem/relebactam is ≤0.25/4 – ≥16/4 μg/mL for all species. The reference panel contained
two-fold serial dilutions with a range of ≤0.015 to ≥64 μg/mL. The testing conditions for the
reference method consisted of the following:
• Medium – Cation Adjusted Mueller Hinton broth
• Inoculum – Direct colony suspension
• Incubation – 35°C; 16-24 hours
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test
inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using the
DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 379 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were evaluated: 62% were considered
contemporary isolates and 38% were stock isolates. One isolate did not grow in the VITEK 2
AST-Gram Negative Imipenem/relebactam test card so complete test results are available for 378
clinical isolates: 349 isolates from indicated species (17 C. freundii, 15 C. koseri, 39 K.
aerogenes, 15 E. asburiae, 10 E. cloacae, 97 E. coli, 23 K. oxytoca, 4 K. pneumoniae
pneumoniae, 52 K. pneumoniae, and 77 P. aeruginosa) and 29 isolates from non-indicated
species (1 C. braakii, 22 E. cloacae complex, 2 E. vulneris, 1 L. amnigena 2, 2 P. dispersa and 1
R. ornithinolytica). The clinical isolates were tested with the auto-dilution option of the VITEK
2.

were evaluated at one site. The challenge set was tested with the auto-dilution and manual
dilution options of the VITEK 2 and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact.
At the time of comparative testing, resistant isolates were not available for C. freundii, C. koseri,
and E. asburiae. Thus, the following statement is included in the Limitations section of the
device labeling:
The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s) is
unknown because an insufficient number of resistant strains were available at the time of
comparative testing: Imipenem/Relebactam: C. freundii, C. koseri, and E. asburiae
To address testing of non-indicated species, the following statement is included in the
Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.
Clinical and Challenge Data –VITEK 2 Auto-Dilution
The results obtained using the auto-dilution method of the VITEK 2 from the 486 total isolates

Resistance Mechanism Characterization
Challenge isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa harboring various molecular
mechanisms of resistance noted in the FDA drug label were evaluated with AST-Gram Negative
Imipenem/Relebactam. The following drug label listed mechanisms were evaluated: KPC, CTX-
M, TEM, SHV, PDC, GES, VEB, and PER.
MIC Trends:
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method for each organism species and group. This trending
calculation analyzes device MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions
lower or higher than the reference method. MIC values that are off-scale for both the reference
and device are not considered in the trending analysis.
Trending results were stratified by species to determine if species-related trends were observed
(Table 7). Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher or
lower MIC values was ≥30% with a statistically significant confidence interval were considered
to have evidence of trending.
A trend was not observed for the Enterobacteriaceae family combined; however, a trend towards
lower MIC values was observed for C. koseri and K. pneumoniae while a trend towards higher
MIC values was observed for E. cloacae when compared to reference testing. The following
footnote to the performance table is included in the package insert to address the trending
observed for VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Imipenem/relebactam:
A trending analysis was conducted using combined data (clinical and challenge) for
Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The trending analysis determined the
VITEK 2 Imipenem/Relebactam, when compared to the reference broth microdilution,

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-resources/fda-recognized-antimicrobial-susceptibility-
test-interpretive-criteria). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria
that bioMérieux intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GN Imipenem/relebactam when
revised breakpoints for imipenem/relebactam are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The
breakpoint change protocol included with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are
met, bioMérieux will update the imipenem/relebactam device label to include (1) the new
breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket
notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined by their
evaluation.
