IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Reagent is an immunoassay utilizing particle-based multi-analyte
technology. The kit contains one Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Reagent Cartridge with the
following reagents for 250 determinations:
• tTG, DGP, and Control paramagnetic particles, preserved
• Assay buffer – containing protein stabilizers and preservatives
• PE Tracer IgA – PE labeled anti-human IgA antibody, containing buffer, protein
stabilizers and preservative
• Rehydration Buffer – containing protein stabilizers and preservatives
The Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Calibrators and Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Controls are sold
separately:
• The Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Calibrators include three Calibrators: Calibrator 1,
Calibrator 2, and Calibrator 3. Each Calibrator is provided with two barcode labeled
Food and Drug Administration

tubes each containing 0.3 mL pre-diluted and ready to use reagent. Calibrators
contain human antibodies to DGP and tTG in stabilizers and preservatives.
• The Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Controls include two controls: Control 1 and Control
2. Each Control is provided with two barcode labeled tubes each containing 0.5 mL,
ready to use reagent. Controls contain human antibodies to DGP and tTG in
stabilizers and preservatives.
B Principle of Operation:
Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Reagent contains two (2) different populations of particles; one
particle coated with recombinant tissue transglutaminase antigen and one particle coated with
synthetic deamidated gliadin peptide.
The Aptiva System dilutes the patient sample 1:46, then combines an aliquot of diluted patient
sample, and reagent into a cuvette. The mixture is incubated at 37°C. After a wash cycle,
conjugated anti-human IgA antibody is added to the particles and this mixture is incubated at
37°C. Excess conjugate is removed in another wash cycle, and the particles are re-suspended in
system fluid.
Multiple images are generated by the system in order to identify and count the two (2) unique
analyte particles, as well as determine the amount of conjugate on each particle. A third particle,
coated with goat anti-human IgA antibodies, is present in the reagent as a control to flag low
concentrations of IgA in the sample as an assay verification step. The median fluorescent
intensity (MFI) for each analyte is proportional to the concentration of conjugate bound to
human IgA, which is proportional to the concentration of IgA antibodies bound to the
corresponding particle region. The system uses the MFI from at least 50 particles of each region.
The identity of the particles is determined by the unique signature of the particles.
Each analyte in the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Reagent is assigned a predefined lot specific
Master Curve. The analyte specific Master Curve is stored on the reagent cartridge RFID label.
Based on results obtained by running calibrators (supplied separately), the system creates
instrument specific Working Curves.
Working curves are used by the software to calculate Fluorescent Light Units (FLU) for each
analyte from the MFI values obtained for each sample.
Based on the defined cut-off for each analyte, the test results are reported for each sample as
“positive” or “negative” with test value in FLU for each assay, i.e., DGP IgA and tTG IgA.
Instrument Description Information: The Aptiva instrument is a fully automated, random
access analyzer. This platform is a closed system with continuous load and random-access
capabilities that processes the samples, runs the reagent and reports results. It includes liquid
handling hardware, optical module (OM), and integrated computer with proprietary software and
touch screen user interface.

2. Specimen Identification:
A barcode scanner is part of the instrument system and is used to identify specimens.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The instrument system has automated specimen sampling and handling.
4. Calibration:
In-house standards are used to create the master curves for the lot specific Aptiva Celiac
Disease IgA Reagent. The lot specific master curve is stored in the reagent cartridge RFID
label. The three calibrators (sold separately) produce an instrument specific working curve
from the parameters of each master curve with a 21-day recalibration.
5. Quality Control:
Each new lot of reagent cartridge must be calibrated prior to first time use. The software will
not allow a new lot to be used until it is calibrated. Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Controls (sold
separately) are recommended to be run once every day that the reagent is used; however,
users should also consider national/local regulatory requirements. Quality control (QC) rules
allow the laboratory to define the acceptance criteria for any reagent control materials being
run. To set QC acceptance criteria, the user must have Manager-level permissions.
The user can configure days and time to automatically run the Initialize and Prime
maintenance operation. It is recommended to set the instrument to prime daily, prior to the
start of use. Results are automatically archived daily. It is recommended to set the daily
archive at a time when the instrument will not be in use.

2. Linearity:
The linearity across the analytical measuring range (AMR) of each analyte, i.e., 0.72 –
250.00 FLU for anti-DGP IgA and 1.02 – 600.00 FLU for anti-tTG IgA, was evaluated in
accordance with CLSI EP6-A. The study was done by using four human serum samples with
various anti-DGP and anti-tTG antibody concentrations which were combined with another
human serum sample containing low levels of antibodies in 10% increments (from 0% to
90% of low sample) to obtain values that cover the entire AMR. Each dilution was tested in
duplicate. Percentage recovery of obtained mean results was calculated compared to the
expected results. Results were analyzed according to the guideline performing regression
analysis and identifying the best fitting polynomial.
The linear regression analysis was performed using the samples falling within the master
curve and the results of samples within AMR are summarized as follows:

The data support the linearity for the claimed AMR from 0.72 FLU to 250.00 FLU for the
anti-DGP IgA assay and the claimed AMR from 1.02 FLU to 600.00 FLU for the anti-tTG
IgA assay, both as part of the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Reagent.
Auto-rerun:
To validate the auto-rerun function with 1:10 dilutions, two positive specimens with anti-
DGP IgA (2401.17 and 4910.42 FLU) and two positive specimens with anti-tTG IgA (267.21
and 562.56 FLU) concentrations well above the assay measuring range were run with the
auto-rerun function enabled on the Aptiva Instrument. The same set of samples were
manually diluted 1:10, tested and used as reference values. Comparing the values obtained by
the auto-rerun to the manual dilution, the recovery values ranged from 93.8% to 97.7% for
DGP IgA, 89.2% to 99.8% for tTG IgA.
Hook Effect
The possibility of hook effect for Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Reagent on the Aptiva System
was evaluated with testing four anti-DGP IgA high positive samples (404.25, 1026.68,
1180.36 and 1229.19 FLU) and seven high positive samples with anti-tTG IgA (690.85,
708.21, 793.38, 897.82, 1609.51, 1624.62 and 1746.20 FLU). No antigen excess hook effect
was observed up to 1229.19 FLU for DGP IgA and up to 1746.20 FLU for tTG IgA.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
An interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 using a set of three human
serum specimens for DGP IgA and three serum specimens for tTG IgA: one positive – DGP
IgA (98.8 FLU) and tTG IgA (40.42 FLU); one near the cutoff – DGP IgA (5.10 FLU) and
tTG IgA (6.68 FLU); and one negative serum sample – DGP IgA (1.62 FLU) and tTG IgA
(1.66 FLU) – each tested in triplicates with the spiked interfering substances in the table
below. The % recovery for each sample spiked with the potential interfering substance was
calculated by comparing its result to that of the corresponding control sample without the
interfering substance. No significant interferences were observed in the study up to the
interferant’s levels tested as shown in the table below.

DGP IgA assay: 0.72 FLU – 250.00 FLU
tTG IgA assay: 1.02 FLU – 600.00 FLU
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
There is no international reference material for anti-DGP or anti-tTG antibodies that allows
for the standardization of anti-DGP or anti-tTG antibodies detection assays. Calibrator and
control values are directly traceable to in-house standards that are used to create the master
curves for the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Reagent.
Stability:
Kit stability (unopened): An accelerated stability study the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA
Reagent was performed using three lots stored at 37°C for five weeks. Nine samples were run
in duplicate for DGP IgA and seven samples run in duplicate for tTG IgA. The accelerated
stability study supports a claim for a 24-month shelf-life.
Real-time stability study was performed at 8-month intervals on the Aptiva Celiac Disease
IgA reagents stored at 2–8°C. At each timepoint, a negative sample (Negative Control), a low
positive sample (Positive Control) and a high positive patient sample (DGP IgA: 51.10 FLU
and tTG IgA: 1113.90 FLU) were tested at time zero, 12 months, 20 months, 24 months and
25 months. The first lot supports the 24-month stability claim. The second and third lots are
on-going.
On-board (In-use) stability: An on-board stability study was performed for the reagent
cartridge. One lot of the reagent cartridge was tested using human serum samples: nine DGP
IgA; 12 tTG IgA. In addition, 14 samples of IgA Control bead were also tested. The
specimens were tested periodically for 45 days at each timepoints with a total of 15
timepoints for the DPP IgA, tTG IgA reagent cartridges and IgA Control beads. At day 21
the reagent cartridge was recalibrated. The results support an on-board stability claim of 42
days with a 21-day recalibration.
Sample stability: Eight samples ranging from 2.20 FLU to 177.16 FLU for DGP IgA and six
samples ranging from 3.35 FLU to 337.81 FLU for tTG IgA were tested. All samples were
tested in duplicates for up to 21 days while stored at 2–8°C, up to 48 hours while stored at
room temperature (RT), and after repeated freeze/thaw cycles up to five cycles. Results were

compared to those obtained on control samples (time zero / zero cycles). The results support
sample stability for 48 hours at RT, 14 days at 2–8°C, and up to five freeze/thaw cycles when
samples are stored at or below -20°C.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying eight blank samples in five replicates
per sample over three days with two reagent lots. One hundred twenty data points were
generated for each lot. LoB was calculated as the 95th percentile using the non-parametric
method for each lot as the dataset showed non-normal distribution. The highest LoB was
determined to be 0.00 FLU DGP IgA and 0.01 FLU for tTG IgA.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by using four samples with low level of anti-
DGP and anti-tTG antibodies. Each sample was tested in five replicates over three days with
two reagent lots. LoD was calculated as the LoB + 1.652 x SD of the replicates for the
samples. The LoD was determined to be 0.65 FLU for DGP IgA and 0.37 FLU for tTG IgA.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by assaying four low level samples of anti-
DGP IgA and anti-tTG IgA with two reagent lots. Each sample was run in replicates of five,
twice per day, for three days, with a total of 120 data points generated on each assay, on each
reagent lot. The LoQ was defined to be the lowest concentration level that meets the within-
laboratory imprecision of <20% for each lot. The LoQ for each assay was determined as the
greatest LoQ across the two lots and set as the lower limit of the AMR. The claimed LoQ is
0.72 FLU for the DGP IgA assay and 1.02 FLU for the tTG IgA assay.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Reagent cut-off was established by testing 12 celiac disease
samples and 200 presumably negative autoimmune disease samples [30 infectious disease,
20 systemic sclerosis, 20 systemic lupus erythematosus, 15 Crohn’s disease, 30 autoimmune
thyroid, 30 primary biliary cholangitis, 40 rheumatoid arthritis, and 15 ulcerative colitis
samples]. The assay cut-off was established as 5.00 FLU (78 MFI for DGP IgA and 190
MFI for tTG IgA) to ensure optimal differentiation between DGP IgA and tTG IgA positive
and negative samples.
For both DGP IgA and tTG IgA, an interpretation of “positive” is for samples ≥5.00 FLU
and an interpretation of “negative” is for samples with FLU <5.00 FLU.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Analytical and clinical studies results support the accuracy of the instrument.
9. Carry-Over:
Samples from celiac disease patients were used to study potential carry-over of the Aptiva
Celiac Disease IgA assay. All samples were selected based on high positivity for either one
of the markers (tTG, DGP) or for both. All samples were tested 10 times alternating with a
reagent blank (no serum pipetted). Results confirmed that no reagent blank result is above the

All samples (n=495) from the clinical validation study (described in Section C.1. below) were
tested on the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Reagent and on their predicates, the QUANTA Flash
DGP IgA and tTG assays. Among them, 200 samples have anti-DGP IgA levels within the
AMR for DGP IgA of the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Reagent and the QUANTA Flash DGP
IgA, and 197 samples have anti-tTG IgA levels within the AMR for tTG IgA of the Aptiva
Celiac Disease IgA Reagent and the QUANTA Flash tTG IgA. The method comparison
analysis comparing the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgA Reagent with the predicate devices on
samples within the AMR is summarized in the following tables for each analyte.
