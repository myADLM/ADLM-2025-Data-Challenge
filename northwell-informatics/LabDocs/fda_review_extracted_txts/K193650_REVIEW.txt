See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The DiaSorin LIAISON Ferritin assay is a quantitative automated chemiluminescent
immunoassay (CLIA) for the in vitro detection of ferritin in human serum, serum separator tubes
(SST), or lithium (Li) Heparin plasma to aid in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia and iron
overload.
This assay must be performed on the LIAISON XL Analyzer.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
LIAISON XL analyzer (K103529)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The LIAISON Ferritin assay contains 100 determinations:
• Magnetic particles - coated with monoclonal anti-ferritin antibody (mouse) in a BSA-
containing buffer with 0.09% sodium azide; 2.3 mL
• Calibrator 1, low: containing ferritin from human liver in a human serum albumin-
containing buffer with 0.09% sodium azide; 1.0 mL
• Calibrator 2, high: containing ferritin from human liver in a human serum albumin-
containing buffer with 0.09% sodium azide; 1.0 mL
• Conjugate: containing monoclonal anti-ferritin antibody (mouse) labeled with isoluminol
in a BSA-containing buffer with 0.09% sodium azide; 28.0 mL
• Specimen Diluent, containing human serum albumin and 0.09% sodium azide; 25.0 mL
B Principle of Operation:
Ferritin present in calibrators, samples or controls binds to an anti-ferritin mouse monoclonal
antibody is coated on the magnetic particles (solid phase). After a wash step, an anti-ferritin
antibody conjugate binds to the ferritin already bound to the solid phase. After a final wash
cycle, the starter reagents are added to trigger a chemiluminescence reaction. The light signal is

measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is in proportion of the ferritin
concentration present in calibrators, samples, or controls.

2. Linearity:
Linearity studies were conducted to evaluate the linearity consulting CLSI EP06-A. Four
serum samples were evaluated to interrogate the entire measuring range: they were
approximately 50, 500, 1500, and 2000 ng/mL. For each sample, a series
of seven evenly spaced dilutions were prepared by mixing a ferritin-free serum and a high
serum pool. All samples were tested in triplicate on the LIAISON analyzer. The linear and
polynomial regression analyses of the mean observed reads (y) against the mean expected
values (x) was performed. The percent recovery obtained for all dilutions for each sample
was always between 90–110% and no 2nd or 3rd order polynomial fit was statistically better
than a linear fit at the 5% significance level for any of the samples used in the study. The
linear equations generated are shown below:

1.00 1.4–2095.0
(~2000 ng/mL) (0.98–1.04) (-26.6–51.2)
Extended Range:
An extended range study was conducted using five serum samples at concentrations: ranging
from 1938 ng/mL, 25013 ng/mL, 50,009 ng/mL, 75,000 ng/mL, and 100,000 ng/mL. The
samples were diluted directly using the LIAISON XL Analyzer instrument with Specimen
Diluent present on board, in a ratio of 1:50. Each diluted sample was tested in triplicate. The
results of diluted samples were compared to the expected concentration. The percent
recovery of the tested samples ranged from 99% to 108%.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were conducted according to CLSI EP07-A2 and CLSI EP37-A to
evaluate the performance of the LIAISON Ferritin assay in the presence of endogenous and
other potential interfering substances including commonly used drugs. Aliquots from three
human serum sample pools with ferritin concentrations of approximately 20 ng/mL, 200
ng/mL, and 2000 ng/mL were split and spiked with interferent solvent and one was spiked
with potential interferents. Each sample/substance combination was tested in replicates of 18,
with the exception of HAMA and RF which were tested in replicates of six. The sponsor
defines non-significant interference as within ± 10% bias between the mean spiked sample
value and the mean control value. The following substances did not show significant
interference at the concentrations listed:

support the claims that the reagents can be stored at the labeling recommendation (2–8°C) for
8 weeks.
Testing serum, SST serum, and Li-heparin samples demonstrated the samples are stable for
one month at -20°C; at 20–25°C (i.e., room temperature) up to 24 hours; and at 2–8°C up to
seven days.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) studies
were conducted using serum samples.
A LoB study was conducted using two reagent lots and five serum samples stripped of
ferritin. The blank samples were tested over four runs (triplicate measurements/sample/run)
over three days yielding 60 results per reagent lot (N=60 measurements per lot, 120
measurements per instrument). The four runs for each reagent lot were repeated on a second
different LIAISON XL Analyzer, for a total of 240 measurements. The LoB was calculated
for each of the two reagent lots using the equation from the CLSI EP17-A2 as follows:
LoB = Mean (Blank Dose) + 1.653 * Standard Deviation (Blank Dose)
The claimed LoB for the candidate device is 0.004 ng/mL, the higher of the two kit lots.
A LoD study was conducted using two reagent lots and four human serum samples with
ferritin concentration ranging from 0.002 ng/mL to 0.303 ng/mL). Each sample was tested in
triplicate in four runs over three days (12 replicates per sample per reagent lot) yielding a
total of 48 results per reagent lot. The four runs for each reagent lot were repeated on a
second different LIAISON XL Analyzer, for a total of 96 measurements. The LoD was
calculated for each of the two reagent lots using the equation from the CLSI EP17-A2 as
follows:
LoD = LoB + 1.655 * Standard Deviation (Sample Dose)
The overall assay’s LoD was defined as the highest of the two kit lots LoD. The claimed LoD
is 0.073 ng/mL.
A LoQ study was conducted using nine different samples ranging from 0.000 to 3.388
ng/mL. Each sample was tested in triplicate in four runs over four days (12 replicates per
sample per reagent lot per instrument) yielding a total of 108 results per reagent lot per
instrument. Two lots were tested on three instruments. The LoQ was estimated using the
precision profile of the samples according to CLSI EP17-A2. The sponsor defined the LoQ
as the concentration of ferritin showing an imprecision of 20%. The overall assay’s LoQ was
defined as the highest of the three (3) kit lots LoQ. The claimed LoQ is 0.461 ng/mL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed by testing 173 human serum samples in
singlicate on the candidate device (LIAISON Ferritin) and the predicate device. The samples

tested in the study spanned the claimed measuring range and covered medical decision
points. The ferritin concentration in the samples tested in the study ranged from 2.0 ng/mL
to 1932.0 ng/mL with the candidate device and 1.4 ng/mL to 1920.0 ng/mL with the
predicate device. The results of the Passing-Bablok regression analysis are as shown below:
N Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) R2
173 0.96 (0.95–0.98) -1.12 (-2.13 – -0.32) 0.995
2. Matrix Comparison:
A study comparing serum, SST serum, and lithium heparin plasma was performed using 43
matched samples (37 native and 6 contrived) covering the measuring range (3.8–1946
ng/mL, serum). A Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis is shown below:
Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) Pearson r
Serum vs. SST 1.00 (0.97–1.04) 0.02 (-0.77– 0.64) 0.999
Serum vs. Li-heparin 0.98 (0.94 – 0.99) -1.73 (-2.14– -0.52) 0.999
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
2. Clinical Specificity:
Not applicable
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Previously established ferritin reference ranges were verified by testing 78 serum specimens (39
female, 39 male) collected from five different sites in the U.S. The specimens were selected to
reflect typical racial/ethnic distribution within the U.S. using www.census.gov as a reference.
N Age Range Median 95th Percentile
(years) (ng/mL)
Female 39 18–92 52.2 6.3–317.1 ng/mL
Male 39 21–82 124.3 3.6–362.4 ng/mL
In the labeling, the sponsor states, “It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own
range of expected values for the population taken into consideration.”
