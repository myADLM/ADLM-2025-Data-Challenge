III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test Kit is intended as a
qualitative presumptive (first-step) test for the detection of IgM antibodies to B. burgdorferi
sensu stricto in human serum from symptomatic patients or people suspected of infection.
Positive and equivocal results must be supplemented by testing with a second-step Western blot
assay.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements: None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
During the test procedure, antibodies to B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) if present in the human
serum sample will bind to the antigens coated onto the wells forming antigen-antibody
complexes. Excess antibodies are removed by washing. A conjugate of goat anti-human IgM
antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase is then added, which binds to the antigen-
antibody complexes. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. This is followed by the addition
of a chromogenic substrate, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). If specific antibodies to the antigen are
present in the patients’ serum, a blue color will develop. The enzymatic reaction is then stopped
with a stopping solution causing the contents of the well to turn yellow. The wells are read
photometrically with a microplate reader at 450nm.
The antigens used in the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test kit is
a combination of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31 lysate, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto
strain 2591 lysate, and a recombinant VlsE protein from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31
grown in E. coli SURE2 cells.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: To determine the precision of the Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test, a within-
lab precision study was conducted. A precision panel consisting of a negative sample, a high
negative sample, a low positive sample, and a moderate positive sample, along with the kit
controls, was tested in-house. Each of the panel members was tested in duplicate, twice per
day, for 12 days. The sample panel was masked and randomized. The results are summarized
in the following table:

Interfering Substances: The effect of potential interfering substances on samples using the
Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test was evaluated. Three
samples, a high negative, an equivocal and a low positive were spiked with high levels of
interferants and were tested along with serum without spiked interferants. The recommended
concentrations from the guideline “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry” EP07-A3
from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute were used (see table below). The tested
substances did not affect the performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia
burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test.

additional 194 samples consisting of 114 samples from different phases of Lyme disease, 8
negative healthy samples, 72 negative Lyme disease samples but do have other diseases that
may cause serologic cross-reactivity, were tested. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of the assay and confirm that the chosen
cutoff provided the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Comparison studies were conducted at three sites (one internal and two external reference
laboratories) using prospective samples submitted for Lyme serology testing. 531 serum
samples were tested on both the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA
Test and on the predicate B. burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test. The results are summarized in the
