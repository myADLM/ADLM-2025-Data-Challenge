III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG ELISA Test Kit is intended as a
qualitative presumptive (first-step) test for the detection of IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi
sensu stricto in human serum from symptomatic patients or people suspected of infection.
Positive and equivocal results must be supplemented by testing with a second-step Western blot
assay.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements: None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description: During the test procedure, antibodies to B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) if
present in the human serum sample will bind to the antigens coated onto the wells forming
antigen-antibody complexes. Excess antibodies are removed by washing. A conjugate of goat
anti-human IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase is then added, which binds to
the antigen- antibody complexes. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. This is followed by
the addition of a chromogenic substrate, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). If specific antibodies to
the antigen are present in the patients’ serum, a blue color will develop. The enzymatic reaction
is then stopped with a stopping solution causing the contents of the well to turn yellow. The
wells are read photometrically with a microplate reader at 450nm.
The antigens used in the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG ELISA Test kit is
a combination of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31 lysate, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto
strain 2591 lysate, and a recombinant VlsE protein from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31
grown in E. coli SURE2 cells.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: To determine the precision of the Borrelia burgdorferi IgG ELISA Test, a within-
lab precision study was conducted. A precision panel consisting of a negative sample, a high
negative sample, a low positive sample, and a moderate positive sample, along with the kit
controls, was tested in-house. The sample panel was masked and randomized. Each of the
panel members was tested in duplicate, twice per day, for 12 days. The results are
summarized in the following table:

Reproducibility: A reproducibility panel consisting of a negative sample, a high negative
sample, a low positive sample, and a moderate positive sample, along with the kit controls,
was tested at three different sites. The sample panel was masked and randomized. Each of the
panel members was tested in triplicate, twice per day, for five days. The Within-Run,
Between-Run, Between-Days, and Between-Sites Standard Deviation and Coefficients of
Variation (CV) were calculated. The sample panel was masked and randomized. The results
are summarized in the following table:

Interfering Substances: The effect of potential interfering substances on samples using the
Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG ELISA Test was evaluated. Three
samples, a high negative, an equivocal and a low positive were spiked with high levels of
interferants and were tested along with serum without spiked interferants. The recommended
concentrations from the guideline “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry” EP07-A3
from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute were used. The tested substances did not
affect the performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG ELISA
Test.

The cutoff was determined by testing a total of 210 normal sera which consisted of 105 sera
from an endemic region of Lyme disease and 105 sera from a non-endemic region of Lyme
disease. The mean plus two standard deviations was used to determine the assay cutoff. A
known positive sample was then diluted to produce a ready to use cutoff control. An
additional 194 samples consisting of 114 samples from different phases of Lyme disease, 8
negative healthy samples, 72 negative Lyme disease samples but do have other diseases that
may cause serologic cross-reactivity, were tested. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
