The change was for a modified Rheumatoid Factor (RF) interference claim in the
“Limitations/Interfering substances” section of the HemosIL von Willebrand Factor
Antigen package insert from “the presence of Rheumatoid Factor may produce an
overestimation of vWF:Ag results on ACL Family Systems” and “vWF:Ag results on
ACL TOP Family and ACL TOP Family 50 Series are not affected by Rheumatoid
Factor up to 750 IU/mL” to a new claim. The new claim states “vWF:Ag results on
ACL Family Systems are not affected by Rheumatoid Factor up to 50 IU/mL” and
“vWF:Ag results on ACL TOP Family and ACL TOP Family 50 Series are not affected
by Rheumatoid Factor up to 50 IU/mL.”
4. Comparison Information (i.e., similarities and differences) to the submitter's legally marketed
predicate device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics.
5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification
on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation
activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
