II Review Summary:
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the submitter's own
CLASS II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable.
1. The name and 510(k) numbers of the SUBMITTER'S previously cleared device, the epoc®
Blood Analysis System, k092849, k093297, k113726, and k171247.
2. Submitter's statement that the INDICATIONS FOR USE/INTENDED USE of the
modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed
labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available,
advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do
not affect the intended use).
3. A description of the device MODIFICATIONS, including clearly labeled diagrams,
engineering drawings, photographs, user's and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to
demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified
device has not changed. This change was for:
• Change from the previously cleared epoc® Host (a dedicated-use Personal Digital
Assistant (PDA) computer-based platform that operators on Microsoft® Windows
Mobile 6.5 Operating System (OS)) to the new epoc® NXS Host (a tablet-based
mobile platform running on Android 9.0 OS). These changes include the following:
Changes to the epoc® System user manual and Quick Start Guide to add
o
instructions specific for the NXS Host.
Change to the epoc® Host Software application (from a Windows-based OS to
o
Android 9 OS), including a new user interface
Hardware changes
o
 Change in form factor for Cradle (device component that holds the epoc®
NXS Host)
 New mobile computer assembly (change in processors and electronics,
battery, and power circuits)
 Bluetooth and Wi-Fi module
 New barcode scanner
 New touchscreen
 New case surface materials and structural design
 New MicroSD card
 New audio component

4. Comparison Information (i.e., similarities and differences) to the submitter's legally marketed
predicate device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics.
5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification
on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation
activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter's description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information
between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific
technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as
specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined
substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
