2. Specimen Requirement and Sample preparation:
The OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System is intended for use with FFPE colorectal
tissue samples collected from colorectal cancer patients. The test requires DNA
extracted from colorectal cancer and matched normal tissue to be extracted and run in
parallel to yield a test result. Tissue sections suitable for use in the assay contain
sufficient nucleated cells and a tumor content ≥30% tumor cells, and range in volume
from 0.1mm3 to 2.0mm3.
DNA is extracted from FFPE tissue specimens using the Maxwell CSC system and
Maxwell CSC FFPE DNA extraction kit. Tumor and matched normal tissue specimens
are extracted in parallel. The minimum recommended DNA input for the test is 1ng of
DNA in 2 ul of volume for processing test material. DNA is quantified using a
fluorescence-based DNA quantification system consisting of ds-DNA binding dye and
a fluorometer.
3. DNA Amplification and Capillary electrophoresis:
Tumor and normal DNA from patient specimens are amplified with the fluorophore
labeled primers for co-amplification of seven microsatellite markers; five mononucleotide
repeat markers ((BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24 and MONO-27) and two
pentanucleotide repeat markers (Penta C and Penta D,) in parallel. The expected amplified
size ranges and detection channels for the markers included in the OncoMate MSI Dx
Analysis System Amplification Kit. are listed in Table 1b. The specifications for thermal

OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System amplification products are analyzed by capillary
electrophoresis using the Applied Biosystems 3500 Dx Genetic Analyzer in ‘Diagnostic
Mode’ using POP-7 3500 Dx Series Polymer and a 3500 Dx Series Capillary Array, 50cm.
During capillary electrophoresis, OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System amplification
products are separated and analyzed alongside fluorescently labeled DNA fragments of
known size, the Size Standard 500.
4. Data Analysis:
The OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System generates size data (i.e., DNA fragment length)
for microsatellite regions amplified from matched normal and CRC tumor sample pairs.
These data are analyzed using the OncoMate MSI Dx Interpretive Software to determine
tumor sample MSI status. Following capillary electrophoresis, the resulting DNA
fragment data (.fsa files) are simultaneously imported and analyzed by the OncoMate MSI
Dx Interpretive Software. During this process, data quality control (QC) checks are
performed, and DNA fragments amplified from seven microsatellite regions are sized with
reference to the size standard fragments at each loci is analyzed by the software per the
criteria described in Result Interpretation section below.
5. Controls:
1. Positive and Negative controls
The Positive Control is 2800M Control DNA (10ng/µl) which is DNA extracted
from a microsatellite stable human cell line. The No-template Control is Water,
Amplification Grade which is used as a reagent blank.
Each control is analyzed concurrently with patient samples to verify assay
performance. At least one 2800M Control DNA amplification reaction and one no-
template control amplification reaction must be completed for each plate (i.e., batch)
of patient samples analyzed using the OncoMate MSI Dx Interpretive Software. The

no-template control reaction is analyzed to ensure that no unexpected amplification
occurred in no-template reactions, which would indicate the presence of DNA
contamination and lead to an Invalid assay result. The positive control reaction is
analyzed to demonstrate that the amplification chemistry performed as expected.
2. Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) Standards
All analyzed samples and controls must contain Size Standard 500 (added prior to
CE). Size Standard 500 contains a series of 21 DNA fragments of known lengths (60,
65, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425,
450, 500bp), also referred to as a DNA ladder. Each fragment is labeled with WEN
dye and is detected separately (as a fourth color, orange) in the presence of OncoMate
MSI Dx Analysis System-amplified products using the Applied Biosystems 3500 Dx
Genetic Analyzer. For each sample or control, amplified DNA fragments are sized
with reference to the size standard fragments. The size standard controls for capillary-
to-capillary variations in sizing precision during capillary electrophoresis and allows
direct comparison of samples across the capillary electrophoresis run. Only the 60-
base to 300-base fragments are analyzed for fragment sizing in the OncoMate MSI
Dx Interpretive Software.
6. Result Reporting:
The OncoMate MSI Dx Interpretive Software provides an automated interpretive result,
either microsatellite instability -high (MSI-H) or microsatellite stable (MSS. Five
mononucleotide-repeat markers (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24 and MONO-27) and
two pentanucleotide-repeat markers (Penta C and Penta D) are evaluated. The analysis of
mononucleotide-repeat markers in CRC tumor samples relative to the repeat lengths in
normal tissue determines tumor MSI status. The size difference (bp) between the allele of
interest in the normal and tumor samples is calculated to determine marker stability. The
interpretive software defines marker instability as a 3bp change (implemented as ≥2.75bp
to account for the sizing imprecision of capillary electrophoresis). The interpretive
software will score alleles that are shifted less than 3bp from the normal reference allele as
stable. A tumor sample is interpreted as MSI-H when ≥ 2 markers are ‘Unstable’. A
tumor sample is interpreted as MSS when <2 markers are interpreted as ‘Unstable’.
B. Test Principle:
Lynch Syndrome is an inherited disorder caused by autosomal dominant germline
mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes that increases the risk of
developing many types of cancer. About 3% of colorectal cancer is caused by Lynch
syndrome. The MMR gene products are responsible for repair of DNA replication
errors and mutations to these genes result in accumulation of mutations in genomic
DNA. Accumulation of DNA replication errors can be assessed in short repeat regions
of the genome called microsatellites. Microsatellite instability testing can be used to
identify those colorectal cancer patients who can benefit from confirmatory genetic
testing for Lynch syndrome due to an MSI high (MSI-H) result.
The OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System is a fluorescent, multiplex PCR-based test to
5

--- Page 6 ---
detect DNA sequence length changes in microsatellite regions of colorectal tumor cell
DNA relative to the same regions from the patient’s normal cells. Microsatellites are short,
DNA-repeat regions that are distributed throughout the human genome and are prone to
insertion and deletion copying errors during DNA replication.
The OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System is used to examine the frequency of errors in five
homopolymer (poly-A) microsatellite regions of the genome (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25,
NR-24, and MONO-27). The replication errors result in an increase or decrease in the
number of nucleotides in the locus that can be measured by PCR amplification of the
regions followed by determination of the fragment length of the resultant amplicon.
Amplicons of the expected size indicate DNA repair is functioning normally. A change in
the fragment length is indicative of dysfunction. This assessment is performed by
comparing DNA extracted from matched tumor and normal samples from the same
individual.
If the length of two or more of the five mononucleotide-repeat marker alleles is changed
by ≥2.75 base pairs (bp), the tumor is classified as MSI-H; if the allele length is changed
for only one marker, or if the difference in allele lengths at the five markers is <2.75bp,
the tumor is classified as Microsatellite Stable (MSS). The sizes of the Penta C and Penta
D pentanucleotide-repeat marker alleles are compared as an identity check between the
normal and tumor DNA samples.

VII Performance Characteristics:
A. Analytical performance
1. Precision/Reproducibility Study
Precision of the OncoMate MSI test was assessed in DNA extracted from 7 CRC cases (4
MSI-H and 3 MSS cases) and the corresponding matched normal samples. Samples were
randomized for blind evaluation by two (2) operators located at each of three (3) sites, on
three (3) instruments (1 at each site). Two (2) replicates per sample were tested, using
three (3) lots, two (2) runs per day, on three (3) non-consecutive days for a total of 36
replicates per sample. DNA from the 7 CRC cases and matched normal were extracted at
the sponsor site with the Maxwell CSC DNA FFPE extraction kit on the Maxwell CSC
instrument and quantitated with QuantiFluor dsDNA system according to instructions.
Different thermocyclers were used at each site.
CRC specimens contained a minimum of at least 20% tumor cells and 1 ng DNA (tumor
and Normal each) was used as sample input for the study. Two of the study samples were
generated by mixing tumor and matched normal DNA to yield 20% tumor cell content for
the sample. This was intended to represent challenging case with minimal required tumor
content. One of the two challenging cases at 20% tumor content represented a borderline
case with instability at 3 of the 5 loci (NR-21 and NR-24 were stable for this sample). The
reference status of the markers for the samples used in the study are shown in table below
Table 2: Sample Characteristics for specimens enrolled in Precision study

7 Stable Stable Stable Stable Stable MSS
Precision of the overall qualitative MSI-H or MSS result (i.e., interpretive result) and each
allele was assessed. Positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement
(NPA) were calculated. NPA was based on MSS results. Point estimates and 95%
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals for PPA and NPA were provided for the following
factors:
• Between sites (one instrument within each site)
• Between operators within a site
• Between days per operator
• Between lots within a day
• Within-run
The overall invalid rate for all the sample test results where batch QC passed was 3.4%

(19/504). A total of 13 results were initially invalid during testing. All 13 samples were
reinjected, resulting in 8 samples that resolved and 5 samples that did not resolve. Upon
reamplification, three of the five unresolved samples were resolved. A total of two
samples remained invalid after reamplification and are included in the agreement analysis
below.After repeat testing of invalids and no calls (0.7%; 4/504) in accordance with the
instructions for use, the final invalid rate for the testing was 0.4% (2/504).
The PPAs for MSI-H and NPAs for MSS interpretative results versus expected results
(Table 3 & 4) were reproducible for site, operator, day, lot, and run. The PPAs for site,
operator, day, lot, run and replicate ranged from 83.3 to 100% and the NPAs were all
100%, demonstrating reproducibility for each factor tested. The overall reproducibility
(and 95% CI) for PPA and NPA were 95.8% (91.2 – 98.5) and 100% (96.6 -100),
respectively. The slightly lower agreement rate of 83.1% (51/71) was observed for sample
1 (see table 4 below). This sample also showed 38% (27/71) agreement at BAT-25 and
agreement of 74.6% (53/71) at MONO27 loci. This sample was tested at 20% tumor
content (below the recommended 30% tumor content) to represent a challenging case and
in reference testing showed instability at 3 of the 5 loci.

2. DNA Extraction:
The imprecision of the assay between extractions was evaluated. DNA extractions from
FFPE curls (0.1–2.0mm3 tissue) obtained from four MSI-H, three MSS tumor samples and
matched normal samples were performed using the Maxwell CSC DNA FFPE Kit and the
Maxwell CSC Instrument. The MSI-H samples were at 20–30% tumor content, and the
MSS samples were at 20–60% tumor content. Each sample was processed by 2 operators x
2 replicates x 3 days yielding 12 extractions from 7 CRC specimens (i.e., 84 independent
extractions). These were run in duplicates to generate 24 expected results per sample or a
total of 168 results. Once isolated, the extracted DNA was quantified using the
QuantiFluor dsDNA System and run according to protocol.
A total of five (5) cases study samples initially yielded invalid results. After reinjection of
all five samples, one sample was resolved. The remaining four (4) samples were resolved
by reamplification.
In the study, 96.4% (81/84) of the individual FFPE curls extracted produced results that
were concordant with the predetermined MSI status. The 95% confidence intervals (CI)
for percent correct and percent incorrect results were 89.9 – 99.3% and 0.7–10.1%,
respectively.
The study demonstrated that the Maxwell® CSC Instrument using the Maxwell® CSC

OncoMate™ MSI Dx Analysis System.
3. Normal Range and Cutoff:
Microsatellite instability at each of the five target loci is measured as change in fragment
length in amplification product of matched tumor and normal DNA samples. A normal
range study was conducted to assess the systems capability to resolve amplicons that differ
by >3 base pairs (bp). Two (2) sets of 7 synthetic DNA fragments (“resolution markers”)
consisting of dye-labeled amplicons of known size that are separated by 1bp within each
set was used in the study to assess fragment resolution. The two sets were designed to
bracket the upper (Large) and lower (Small) ends of the amplicon size range of MSI
markers (83-168bp).
Resolution markers were analyzed either mixed only with the Size Standard 500 or mixed
separately with two MSS tumor samples and the Size Standard 500 using the Applied
Biosystems 3500 Dx genetic analyzer and with OncoMate MSI Dx interpretive software.
The sizing precision of individual resolution fragments was characterized (Table 2), and
size differences between all fragments separated by 3bp were calculated and averaged.
Observed mean differences were compared with predicted values.

Resolution fragments were sized with standard deviations ranging from 0.07–0.13bp.
Mean absolute differences calculated for fragments separated by 3bp ranged from 3.06–
3.40bp and 3.05–3.35bp for observed and predicted values, respectively. Measurement
precision of individual resolution markers (standard deviations ≤0.13 base pairs) was
sufficient to detect single-base-pair differences in size. The study met the objective of
demonstrating a ≥3 base pair resolution in the test system.

4. Analytical Sensitivity
i. Limit of Detection:
The analytical sensitivity of the OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System for detection
of each marker when the marker is categorized as instable was evaluated in two
studies. Due to the rarity of samples with 1, 2 or 3 instable markers (i.e., samples
with results that would be considered near the clinical decision point), the LoD was
taken as the lowest tumor proportion at which the minimum DNA input (1ng)
yielded no more than one marker with less than 95% call rate.
Study 1: Analytical sensitivity of the assay was first determined using extracted
DNA isolated from five MSI-H tumor and matched normal samples, as well as a
titration series of the 2800M Control DNA. The 2800M Control DNA samples were
treated as MSS samples for analysis using the OncoMate MSI Dx Interpretive
Software. Contrived MSI-H specimens representing low tumor content were
generating by blending tumor DNA and matched normal non-tumor DNA. The
MSI-H samples and the MSS samples were tested at 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 2.5ng
DNA per amplification reaction with 20 replicates for each sample and DNA
amount (five MSI-H cases × 20 replicates). To evaluate the influence of tumor
content on limit of detection (LOD), one tumor sample was combined with the
matched normal sample to simulate a tumor content of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%.
Each sample in the study was tested on at least 1 instrument with two OncoMate
MSI Dx Analysis system lots at 6 different concentrations by two operators (2
replicates/ operator/ sample) and over 5 days for a total of 20 replicates per sample.
to identify the LOD. New sample dilutions were prepared to test a 0.1ng per
reaction DNA input using samples with a 20% tumor content, as well as a 1ng per
reaction DNA input using a sample containing 2.5% tumor.
A combined lot analysis determined 99.5% (199/200) positivity at a DNA
concentration of 0.1ng/μl (0.2ng input) for sample interpretive results. At the
0.1ng/μl DNA concentration, a No Call test result was obtained for one replicate out
of the twenty replicates for that sample case with a single reagent lot (Table 6) due
to low signal. While 100% positivity was noted at 0.25ng/μl of DNA using a 2μl
(0.5ng) input using the minimum 20% tumor content, test performance at individual
loci was also assessed to determine LoD for each of the target loci as the study did
not include challenging cases with instability at 2 or 3 of the five target loci. Overall
the positivity rate was >95% for NR-21, BAT-26 and MONO-27 loci while at 80%
and 60% for BAT-25 and NR-24 loci. An additional supplemental study was
conducted to determine the DNA input and tumor content at which performance at
these loci would be agree >95% for calling at each loci to represent test
performance with challenging cases. The results are summarized in table 5 below.

Study 2: Because the 95% correct call rate was not achieved for 2 markers when
20% tumor content is used, a supplemental limit of detection study was conducted to
resolve performance at the NR-24 and BAT-25 loci and assess the LoD for detection
of instability at all of the five loci with challenging cases. This study included
specimens with imperfect concordance at different target loci at minimal
recommended assay input of 20% tumor content and 1 ng DNA input though
reference testing at unblended samples (50% tumor content) indicated instability at
all 5 loci for all of the 3 cases. These cases were considered to represent challenging
cases and simulate cases with instability at 2 or 3 loci. Limit of detection for cases
with instability in 2 or 3 of the target loci is defined as tumor content and input at
which there is >95% concordance. Three MSI cases that were generated by blending
the tumor DNA with matched normal DNA were tested with samples simulating
tumor DNA content of 10, 20, 30 and 50% . . Each sample was tested using a single
lot across multiple days on one instrument at three different DNA concentrations
(0.5ng, 1.0ng and 2 ng of DNA) and 20 replicates per concentration. Interpretive
Result frequencies summed across all sample groups from the LoD Supplemental
study with the MSI-H Blended and Diluted sample set for various DNA input at
different tumor contents are shown in Tables 9 13. Sample conditions that fell below
the 95% call rate are in bold.
Agreement rates to instability at each loci was variable (ranging from 0-100%) at 10%
tumor input over the range of DNA concentrations tested and therefore below the LoD
for the test. Similarly, at 20% tumor input instability at precision at the BAT-25 and
NR-24 loci was measured at 0-10% for all concentrations of DNA tested while
MONO-27 instability was measured at 85% agreement for 2 other cases at lowest
DNA input of 0.5ng. At 30% tumor input one of the cases showed agreement rate of
95% at BAT25 and 0% at NR-24 loci while only 50% tumor input produced 100%
agreement for instability at all 5 loci for all 3 cases.
The LoD of the test was assessed at 30% tumor content and 1 ng DNA input based on
100% agreement at interpretive results for all cases tested as well as >95% agreement
at 4 of the 5 loci. While imprecision is noted at 1 of 5 loci, the risk of false negative
test result is considered to be mitigated given the redundancy in calling algorithm
requiring at least 2 of 5 loci being unstable to call MSI status, and inclusion of the
following limitation statement:
“For tumor samples exhibiting instability at a single loci (1/5 alleles unstable) assess
the tumor content and examine electropherograms and consider a retest by enriching
tumor content for the sample or orthogonal testing to rule out a false negative test
result.”

ii. Limit of Blank
A Limit of Blank study was conducted to confirm a blank (an MSS sample in this
study) did not produce positive MSI-H results. The study tested four known MSS
samples across three amplification kit lots, two operators and 60 replicates of each
MSS sample—a total of 1,440 test results.
There were two samples for which the initial test result was invalid. These samples
were reinjected per protocol, and after reinjection were resolved. No reamplification
testing was required for this study.
All tests (1,440/1,440; 100%) resulted in MSS final interpretive results. The 1,440 test
results represent 7,200 mononucleotide locus allele calls. For the mononucleotide loci,
99.99% (7,199/7,200) of the marker stability calls were “Stable”. There was a single
instance of one locus, NR-21, being called unstable. A single unstable locus results in
an MSS final interpretive result, and the one unstable locus did not affect the final test
result. In conclusion, the OncoMateTM MSI Dx Analysis System provides MSS
results that are highly reproducible and were not affected by lot or operator.
5. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
6. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or methods):
OncoMate MSI Dx is not traceable to any known standard. Controls and quality
metrics are described in the device description section.

7. Stability
Studies were conducted to determine the stability of the Promega OncoMate™ MSI
Dx Analysis System and Promega OncoMate™ 5C Matrix Standard.
Prior to execution of the real time or open vial studies, lots of the reagent kits were
subjected to freeze-thaw cycles by cycling between the recommended storage
temperature of -10 to -30C and ambient temperature until thawed. The
OncoMate™ MSI Dx Analysis System amplification kit reagents were subjected to
five freeze-thaw cycles and OncoMate™ 5C Matrix Standard was subjected to one
freeze-thaw cycle.
Following freeze-thaw, the reagent lots were then transferred into shipping containers at -100 C
to -300 C on dry ice and shipped overnight by aircraft to a remote site. The samples were
returned to Promega and stored in the shipping containers for a total of 5 days with sufficient
dry ice to maintain -100 C to -300 C. The reagents were then transferred to a -100 to -300 C
freezer until used for stability testing
i. Real Time Stability study (long term storage and shelf life stability):
Real Time Stability at -300 C to -100 C (OncoMate™ MSI Analysis System
amplification kit)
The purpose of this study was to determine the real time stability of the OncoMate™
MSI Dx Analysis System amplification kit reagents stored at -30C to -10C in real
time. The purpose of these experiments was to confirm the reagents are stable after
storage at -300 C to -100 C.
DNA was extracted from four MSI-High and four MSS CRC tumor samples with
matched normal samples, quantitated, adjusted to 0.5ng/µl and provided to the study
operator. The study operator did not know the MSI status of the samples. Samples
were tested by one operator and instrument using three reagent lots in corrugate
packaging and three reagents lots in paperboard packaging. Two lots in each package
type were subjected to freeze-thaw and shipping, of the OncoMate™ MSI Dx Analysis
System at time zero, followed by each lot being thawed and tested at 6, 13, 19, and 25
months. Two repeats were performed for each time point.
Across all time points a total of 7 results were called Invalid during testing. All 7
samples were reinjected, and 6 samples were resolved. The remaining sample was
resolved upon reamplification.
The Real-Time Long-Term Stability of the OncoMate™ MSI Dx System amplification
kit reagents was determined to be 24 months at frozen storage in both types of
packaging based on the data collected to date. No difference was observed based on
OncoMate™ MSI Dx Analysis System amplification kit lot.
Real Time Stability at -300 C to -100 C followed by 4 months at +2 to 100 C
(OncoMate™ MSI Analysis System amplification kit)

operator. The study operator did not know the MSI status of the samples. Samples
were tested by one operator and instrument using three reagent lots in corrugate
packaging and three reagents lots in paperboard packaging. Two lots in each package
type were subjected to freeze-thaw and shipping of the OncoMate™ MSI Dx Analysis
System amplification kit at time zero and after 4 months storage at -300 C to -100 C.
Another set of samples were stored at -300 C to -100 C for 0, 2, 9, 15, and 21 months.
Each storage period at -300 C to -100 C was followed by storage for 4 months at the
customer in-use temperature of +2 to 100 C. Two repeats were performed for each time
point.
Across all time points a total of 10 results were called Invalid during testing. All 10
samples were reinjected, and 6 samples were resolved. The remaining 4 samples were
resolved upon reamplification.
The Real Time Shelf Life Stability of the OncoMate™ MSI Dx Analysis System
amplification kit reagents was determined to be frozen storage for 20 months followed
by refrigerated storage for four (4) months, for a total of 24 months based on the data
collected to date. No difference was observed based on OncoMate™ MSI Dx Analysis
System amplification kit lot.
Real Time Stability at -300 C to -100 C (OncoMate™ 5C Matrix Standard)
The purpose of this study was to determine the real time stability of the OncoMate™
5C Matrix Standard stored at -300 C to -100 C in real time.
Samples were tested by one operator and instrument using three reagent lots, two lots
subjected to freeze-thaw and shipping, at time zero and after 4 months storage at -300
C to -100 C. Samples were tested after storage at -300 C to -100 C for 0, 6, 13, 19, and
25 months. Two repeats were performed for each time point.
The OncoMate™ 5C Matrix Standard was used to perform spectral calibration on the
Applied Biosystems 3500 Dx Genetic Analyzer as described in the Technical Manual
(TM542). The result of the spectral calibration is a multicomponent matrix, which is
applied during sample detection to compensate for spectral overlap among the dyes
and separate the raw fluorescent signals into individual dye signals. The Quality Value
(Q value) for each capillary was measured by the instrument software. A Q score of
≥0.95 is indicative of a successful spectral calibration.
The Shelf Life Stability of the OncoMate™ 5C Matrix Standard was determined to 24
months for frozen storage based on the data collected to date. No difference was
observed based on OncoMate 5C Matrix Standard lot.
Real Time Stability at -300 C to -100 C followed by 4 months at +20 C to 100 C
(OncoMate™ 5C Matrix Standard)
Another set of samples were stored at -300 C to -100 C for 2, 9, 15, and 21 months.
Each storage period at -300 C to -100 C was followed by storage for 4 months at the
customer in-use temperature of +2 to 100 C. Two repeats were performed for each
19

four (4) months, for a total of 24 months based on the data collected to date. No
difference was observed based on OncoMate™ 5C Matrix Standard lot.
ii. Open vial stability Studies:
The purpose of this study was to determine the open vial shelf life stability of the
OncoMate™ MSI Dx Analysis System amplification kit reagents at +2 to 10° C in real
time.
DNA was extracted from four MSI-High and four MSS CRC tumor samples with
matched normal samples, quantitated, adjusted to 0.5ng/µl, and 10µl aliquots were
provided to the study operator. The study operator did not know the MSI status of the
samples. Samples were tested by one operator and instrument using three reagent lots,
two of the lots were subjected to freeze-thaw and shipment. Tests were conducted at
time zero, followed by each lot being tested at four additional time points of 1, 2, 3,
and 4 months. Two repeats were performed for each time point.
Across all time points a total of 17 results were initially called Invalid during testing.
All 17 samples were reinjected, and 16 samples were resolved. The single remaining
Invalid result was resolved upon reamplification.
The open vial shelf life stability of the OncoMate™ MSI Dx Analysis System
amplification kit reagents was determined to be four (4) months, supporting the
intended claim of 3 months stability at +2 to 100 C.
Open Vial Reagent Stability (OncoMate™ 5C Matrix Standard)
The purpose of this study was to determine the open vial shelf life stability of the
OncoMate™ 5C Matrix Standard at +2 to 10° C in real time.
One OncoMate™ 5C Matrix Standard reagent lot, subjected to freeze-thaw and
shipping, was tested at time zero, followed by testing at four additional time points of
1, 2, 3, and 4 months. Two repeats were performed for each time point.
The open vial short-term stability of diluted OncoMate™ 5C Matrix Standard was
performed at time zero and 7 days using three lots of reagents. Two of the lots were
20

--- Page 21 ---
subjected to freeze/thaw and shipping. The open vial short-term stability study was
performed 7 days after the Matrix Standard was diluted to support a 6 day stability
claim for the diluted Matrix Standard.
The OncoMate™ 5C Matrix Standard was used to perform spectral calibration on the
Applied Biosystems 3500 Dx Genetic Analyzer as described in the Technical Manual
(TM542). The result of the spectral calibration is a multicomponent matrix, which is
applied during sample detection to compensate for spectral overlap among the dyes
and separate the raw fluorescent signals into individual dye signals. The Quality Value
(Q value) for each capillary was measured by the instrument software. A Q score of
≥0.95 is indicative of a successful spectral calibration.
The open vial shelf life stability of the OncoMate™ 5C Matrix Standard was
determined to be four (4) months, supporting the intended claim of 3-month stability at
+2 to 100 C.
The open vial stability of diluted Matrix was determined to be seven (7) days, supporting the
intended claim of six (6) days at +2 to 100 C. No difference was observed based on lot,
regardless of whether the lot was subjected to freeze-thaw and shipping.
8. Expected values:
The OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System determines microsatellite instability status based
on results generated for five mononucleotide repeat markers (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21,
NR-24 and MONO-27). A tumor sample is interpreted as MSI-H when two or more
markers are ‘Unstable’. A tumor sample is interpreted as MSS when fewer than two
markers are interpreted as ‘Unstable’. A sample may be interpreted as ‘No Call’ or
‘Invalid’ due to specific QC failures. During the Method Comparison study (section C
below), the most common observation for MSI-H and MSS samples was for all or none of
the markers to be unstable (147/154 cases, 95%), which is consistent with published
literature.
9. Analytical specificity:
Primer pairs for the seven OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System markers were checked for
target specificity using the publicly available Primer BLAST search tool on the US
National Center for Biotechnology Information website
(https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/, accessed 01/14/2020; Ye et al., 2012). The
primers share 100% identity with their intended targets. Analysis for off target homology
showed that 7 of the 14 primers in the test system exhibited off target homology with
≥80% identity. 3 of the 7 off-target templates had lower annealing temperature than on
target primers and 4 other off targets templates showed high homology to antisense
template. For these 4 off target templates the sense primer would be unlabeled and result
in products that are invisible to the detection system. Therefore, the identified off target
homologies did not interfere with assay interpretation.
The in-silico analysis provided supports target specificity for the proposed primer pairs in
the test.

10. Interference:
A study was performed to establish the potential influence of interfering substances on the
performance of the OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System, specifically chaotropic salts,
alcohol, proteinase K treatment time, necrotic tissue, hemoglobin, triglycerides and mucin.
DNA was extracted from sample curls (0.1–2mm3 tissue). DNA extraction was performed
for each sample at each condition tested using the Maxwell CSC Instrument and
Maxwell® CSC DNA FFPE Kit.
In the first series of experiments, lysates from four tumor and matched normal samples
were spiked with hemoglobin (2mg/ml final concentration), triglycerides (37mM final
concentration) or mucin (1mg/ml final concentration) prior to DNA extraction. Following
analysis with the OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System, all samples yielded the expected
result.
Four tumor and matched normal samples (two replicates per sample for a total of 16
extractions) were incubated at 56°C in the presence of proteinase K for 20 minutes, 30
minutes (recommended condition) or 40 minutes prior to purification. All samples yielded
the expected result.
Twelve tumor samples with necrotic tissue ranging from 0–75% and matched normal
samples were tested. All samples yielded the expected result.
To evaluate the impact of potential carry-over alcohol or guanidine salts from the DNA
purification process, aliquots of the extracted DNA from tumor and matched normal
samples with varying amounts of tissue necrosis (0–75%) were spiked with ethanol (5%
final concentration), guanidine hydrochloride (50µM final concentration) or water prior to
amplification and analysis. All samples yielded the expected result.
There were 13 invalid results initially obtained across the interfering substances
testing. All 13 samples were reinjected, resulting in five samples being resolved. The
remaining eight samples were resolved after reamplification.
The OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System showed no statistically significant impact on
assay performance by the interfering substances, specifically chaotropic salts (50µM
guanidine hydrochloride), ethanol (5%), necrotic tissue (0–75%), hemoglobin (2mg/ml),
triglycerides (37mM), and mucin (1mg/ml) or proteinase K digestion time [20, 30
(standard) or 40 minutes] tested in this study (Table 12).

11. Cross Contamination
The sample-to-sample cross-contamination in the OncoMate™ MSI Dx Analysis System
was evaluated using extracted DNA from an MSI-H sample and an MSS sample,
including both the tumor and its matched normal sample. The samples and reagent blanks
were interspersed in a grid design across 96-well plates. In this plate layout, amplification,
capillary electrophoresis and analysis were performed each day for a total of 10 days.
Expected results included MSI-H, MSS and No Call test results. The No Call test result
was expected for the reagent blanks. The results were not averaged, and any observed
carryover was reported.
There were a total of three invalid results initially obtained in the study. After
reinjection, all three sample results were resolved. No reamplification was performed
for this study.
There was 100% concordance between the interpretative result and the expected results for
the 470 samples analyzed, and no interference with data interpretation was observed. The
study concluded the OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System was not susceptible to sample-
to-sample cross-contamination.

or absence of DNA mismatch repair proteins. Accuracy of the OncoMate MSI Dx
Analysis System result was also assessed by comparison to a validated next generation
sequencing test for germline mutations to the DNA mismatch repair genes (NGS MMR
genes) to confirm identification of Lynch syndrome patients.
The study was performed by testing 130 sequentially selected colorectal cancer patient
samples that were enriched with a second set of 24 suspected Lynch syndrome samples,
for a total of 154 cases. Sample curls, generated from FFPE tissue blocks, were provided
to an external laboratory to perform immunohistochemistry. Extracted DNA aliquots of
154 matched CRC DNA samples of unknown MSI status were randomized then analyzed
by the OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System and by the analytically validated NGS test for
MMR genes.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on all 154 tumor samples to determine protein
expression of the MHL1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and BRAF genes using the predicate on
the provided sample curls, per the predicate instructions for use. BRAF testing was only
performed if the sample exhibited a loss of one of the mismatch repair genes.
DNA from the 154 samples were provided to a reference laboratory for NGS with a
validated test for MMR genes. These samples underwent DNA sequencing to determine
the presence or absence of pathogenic mutations of the mismatch repair genes (MLH1,
MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) and BRAF exon 15. Upon germline testing, 18 Lynch
syndrome cases were confirmed. Only pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations listed in
the ClinVar database were accepted as confirmed Lynch syndrome cases.
A total of two samples yielded invalid results during initial testing. Both samples were
resolved upon reinjection.
1. Method Comparison: OncoMateTM MSI Dx Analysis System vs. IHC Results
The comparison results between the OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System and the
VENTANA IHC MMR Panel for the 154 samples are listed in Table 15. A total of 106
samples were scored as MSS using the OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System and MMR
Intact for all four MMR proteins using the predicate. Forty-one (41) samples exhibited a
loss of IHC staining for at least one of the four MMR proteins (dMMR). Of these 45
samples, 44 samples were scored as MSI-H by the OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System.
Three samples were scored as MSI-H by the OncoMateTM MSI Dx Analysis System but
were scored as MMR Intact by IHC staining for all four MMR proteins. The data are
summarized in Table 16 and Table 17.
The Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was 97.8% (95% CI: 88.4%-99.6%) and the
Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was 97.2% (95% CI: 92.2% - 99.1%). . The
OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System effectively identified tumors with MMR deficiency
and shows agreement with the VENTANA MMR IHC panel.

2. Accuracy assessed by concordance to NGS Mismatch Repair Gene Mutations Results
A total of 18 samples tested positive for Lynch syndrome, based on detection of a
pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation in one of the mismatch repair genes (MLH1,
MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2) and no mutations in BRAF exon 15. The data are summarized in
Table 18, 19 and 20. Seventeen of the samples (17/18) tested MSI-H with the OncoMate
MSI Dx Analysis System. One of the samples (1/18) tested MSS with the OncoMate MSI
Dx Analysis System and exhibited no loss of MMR protein by IHC. This sample is
referenced as having a likely pathogenic mutation in the PMS2 gene on the ClinVar
database. This single nucleotide polymorphism (rs267608153) results in a c.903G>T
variant that likely results in a splicing defect. All 16 of the enrichment cohort samples
tested MSI-H with the OncoMateTM MSI Dx Analysis System.
The Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was 94.4% and the Negative Percent Agreement
(NPA) was 77.9% between the two methods for all samples. The PPA was 100% between
the two methods for the enrichment cohort. The NPA is less informative than the PPA in a
comparison of somatic microsatellite instability to germline mutations in MMR genes,
since cases negative for germline, pathogenic Lynch syndrome mutations include MSI-H
cases with sporadic, somatic causes for dMMR as well as MSS cases. Somatic
mechanisms such as epigenetic silencing and biallelic somatic mutation can lead to
dMMR and an MSI-H phenotype without a germline MMR gene mutation.

3. Level of Concern:
Moderate
4. Specimen Handling:
Refer to Device Description section above.
5. Calibration and Quality Controls:
During capillary electrophoresis, dye-labeled OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System
amplification products are separated and detected using the Applied Biosystems®
3500 Dx Genetic Analyzer. Prior to analysis, the Applied Biosystems 3500 Dx
Genetic Analyzer is calibrated with matrix standards so that the fluorescent signals
resulting from the set of specific dyes used in the assay can be distinguished. The
OncoMate 5C Matrix Standard consists of DNA fragments labeled with five
different fluorescent dyes (fluorescein, JOE, TMR-ET, CXR-ET and WEN) in one
tube. The calibration is performed using the ‘OncoMate_MSI’ dye set, which is
installed on the Applied Biosystems 3500 Dx Genetic Analyzer using the
OncoMate MSI Dx Assay Installer. Once generated, the spectral calibration file is
applied automatically during sample detection to account for the spectral overlap
among the dyes and to separate the raw fluorescent signals into individual dye
signals.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data
Not Covered in the “Performance Characteristics” Section Above:
The OncoMate™ MSI Dx Analysis System was evaluated with three different thermal
cycler models from three different manufacturers. The 2800M Control DNA was used,
and replicates were treated as MSS samples for analysis using the OncoMate MSI Dx
Interpretive Software. Samples were amplified in duplicate with the OncoMate™ MSI
Dx Analysis System amplification kit using 1ng, 2ng or 4ng of DNA on each of three
different thermal cycler models. The thermal cyclers all fall within the following
required performance specifications:
• Maximum Block Ramp Rate: 3.9°C/second to 5°C/second
• Temperature Accuracy: ±0.25°C (at ≥90°C)
• Temperature Uniformity: <0.5°C (at ≥90°C)
• Heated lid capable of reaching 103–105°C
There was 100% agreement (36/36) between the expected and observed MSS call for
all samples. There were no artifacts observed that interfered with the system’s ability
to provide the expected interpretive result when using different thermal cyclers.
