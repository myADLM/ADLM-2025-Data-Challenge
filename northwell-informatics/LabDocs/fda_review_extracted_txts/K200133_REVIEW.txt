C. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
D. Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A. Device Description:
The hCG Urine Test strip and the hCG Urine Test midstream kits consist of one test device
and a package insert. The hCG Urine Test cassette kit consists of one test device, a
disposable plastic dropper, and a package insert. Each test device contains mouse
monoclonal anti-βhCG antibody coated membrane and a pad containing mouse monoclonal
anti-α-hCG antibody colloidal gold conjugate. The control antibodies are goat anti-rabbit
IgG.
B. Principle of Operation:
This device operates by detecting human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the hormone produced
during pregnancy, in urine using a lateral flow sandwich chromatographic immunoassay. The
assay of each device uses a double antibody sandwich method. During the test procedures, hCG
in the urine specimen reacts with the dye conjugate (mouse anti- α -hCG antibody-colloidal gold
conjugate specific to the beta subunit of hCG) and forms a complex. Because of capillary and
chromatographic effects of the nitrocellulose membrane, the complex migrates along the
membrane to the β-hCG antibody line (T) and remains captured in the T line. When hCG is
present in the urine sample two red colored bands develops, one in the test (T) region and
another in the control (C) region, indicating a positive result. If there is no hCG in the urine,
there is only one red line in the control (C) region and no red band in the test (T) region,
indicating a negative result. An invalid result produces either no lines on the device (i.e. no test
or control lines) or one test line in the test region (i.e. a test line but no control line).

2. Linearity:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity:
To evaluate potential cross-reactivity relevant challenge doses of closely-related human
luteinizing hormone (hLH), human follicle stimulating hormone (hFSH) or human thyroid
stimulating hormone (hTSH) were tested using 30 fresh urine specimens obtained from
healthy non-pregnant females. At each hCG concentration (0 mIU/mL and 25mIU/mL), 3
lots (90 replicates) of urine from non-pregnant female samples for each cross-reactant
(hLH/hTSH/hFSH) was tested. The results demonstrated no cross reaction with LH at 500
mIU/mL, FSH at 1000 mIU/mL, and TSH at 1000 µIU/mL.
Interference:
To evaluate the potential for interference by certain exogenous compounds and potentially
interfering clinical conditions, the substances listed were prepared by diluting stock
interference material to the desired concentration. Normal, nonpregnant female urine
specimens containing 0 and 25 mIU/mL hCG were spiked with the interferents to obtain the
desired test concentration. Three lots of each format were tested. The results show that no
interferences were observed from substance at the following concentrations for both negative
and positive hCG urine samples.
Interfering substances Substances concentration
Acetaminophen 20 mg/mL
Aspirin 20 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid 20 mg/mL

Effect of hCG β-core fragment:
To evaluate the effects of the hCG β-core fragment normal nonpregnant female urine
specimens containing 0 and 25 mIU/mL hCG were spiked with the hCG β-core fragment
at concentrations of 125,000, 250,000, 500,000 and 1,000,000 pmol/mL. Three lots of
each format were tested. The data demonstrated that there is no interference when the
hCG β-core fragment was tested at a concentration of 1,000,000 pmol/L.
Effect of urine pH and Specific Gravity:
The pH of an aliquot negative urine pool was adjusted to a pH range of 3 to 9 in 1 pH unit
increments and spiked with hCG at 0 and 25 mIU/mL and 3 lots of hCG Urine Test were
tested. The results showed no interference in samples ranging from pH 3 to 9.
Specific gravity:
Negative specimen containing 0 mIU/mL and specimen with hCG 25mIU/mL were
adjusted to specific gravities of 1.001, 1.020, 1.031, 1.039. Three lots of hCG Urine
Test were tested. The results showed no interference in samples with specific
gravity ranging from 1.001-1.039.
Hook effect study:
To evaluate high dose hook effect, 30 hCG-free specimens spiked with hCG at
5,000, 10,000, 100,000, 500,000, 650,000, 850,000, 950,000 and 1,000,000 mIU/mL
were tested on three lots of devices for each format. The results showed no hook
effect up to 850,000 mIU/mL.

Midstream is 25 mIU/mL. See precision section above.
B. Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Urine samples were collected from 120 women at a hospital laboratory. These samples were
collected from women between the ages of 18 to 44 who were suspected they were pregnant,
experienced late periods or were pregnant. Samples were collected at various time
throughout the day and were randomized prior to testing. Testing was performed by
laboratory professionals at two laboratory sites. Results of the professional using the
candidate device were compared to results obtained from the predicate device. Summary of
results is presented in the tables below:
