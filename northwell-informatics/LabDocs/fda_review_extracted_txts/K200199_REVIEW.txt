III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
For in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative, serial determination of CA 125 in human serum
and plasma (EDTA and lithium heparin) and to aid in the management of patients with ovarian
carcinoma using the ADVIA Centaur XP and ADVIA Centaur XPT systems. The test is intended
for use as an aid in monitoring patients previously treated for ovarian cancer. Serial testing for
CA 125 in the serum and plasma of patients who are clinically free of disease should be used in
conjunction with other clinical methods used for the early detection of cancer recurrence. The
test is also intended for use as an aid in the management of ovarian cancer patients with
metastatic disease by monitoring the progression or regression of disease in response to
treatment. It is recommended that the ADVIA Centaur CA 125II assay be used under the order
of a physician trained and experienced in the management of gynecological cancers. This assay
is not intended for screening or diagnosis of ovarian cancer or for use on any other system.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use on the ADVIA Centaur XP and ADVIA Centaur XPT
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ADVIA Centaur CA 125II Assay kit contains the following:
• ReadyPack, primary reagent packs for 100 or 500 tests
• ADVIA Centaur CA 125II Master Curve card
The ReadyPack for ADVIA Centaur CA 125II consists of the following:
• CA 125II Lite Reagent: 10.0 mL monoclonal mouse anti-M11 antibody labeled with
acridinium ester and monoclonal mouse anti-OC 125 labeled with fluorescein in phosphate
buffer with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and preservatives
• CA 125II Solid Phase Reagent: 25.0 mL monoclonal mouse anti-fluorescein antibody
coupled to paramagnetic particles in phosphate buffer with BSA and preservatives
Materials Required but not provided:
• ADVIA Centaur CA 125II Calibrator
K200199 - Page 2 of 8

--- Page 3 ---
Optional Reagents
• ADVIA Centaur CA125II Master Curve Material
• ADVIA Centaur Multi-Diluent 1
B Principle of Operation:
The ADVlA Centaur CA 125II Assay is a fully automated, single-wash sandwich
immunoassay using direct, chemiluminescent technology, which uses two monoclonal mouse
antibodies specific for CA 125. The first antibody in the Lite Reagent is composed of the
monoclonal mouse antibody toward the CA125 M11 antigenic domain and is labeled with
acridinium ester. The second antibody is directed toward the CA125 OC 125 antigenic domain
and is labeled with fluorescein. The immunocomplex formed with CA 125 is captured with
monoclonal mouse anti-fluorescein antibody coupled to paramagnetic particles in the Solid
Phase Reagent. The sample is incubated with the Lite Reagent for 7.5 minutes at 37 °C to allow
immune complexes to form. The particles in the Solid Phase Reagent are then added and
incubated for an additional 40 minutes at 37 °C to capture the immune complexes. After
incubation, the particles are washed before addition of the Acid Reagent and Base Reagent to
initiate the chemiluminescent reaction. The amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the
system is directly proportional to the quantity of CA 125 antigen present in the patient sample.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and reproducibility of the assay were demonstrated in K020828.
2. Linearity:
The linearity of the assay was demonstrated in K020828.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity was demonstrated in K020828. Interference was evaluated with
hemoglobin, lipids, bilirubin, total protein, chemotherapeutic agents, therapeutic drugs and
tumor marker antigens.
To evaluate the performance of the ADVIA Centaur CA 125 II assay in samples collected
with K2-EDTA and lithium heparin tubes, one sample at low and one at high level of CA125
for each matrix were used to titrate the EDTA and heparin anticoagulants in order to simulate
the effect of partially filled blood collection plasma tube. The nominal K2-EDTA and lithium
heparin concentrations are 1.8 mg/mL and 15.0 U/mL in blood collection tubes, respectively.
Both K2-EDTA and lithium heparin samples were spiked at three times and five times the
additive concentration for testing. Testing was performed in three replicates per sample on
one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument using one lot of reagent. The recovery was calculated as
the difference between the means of the test samples spiked with the interferent and control
samples spiked with the same volume of the interferent vehicle. Results summarized in the
table below show that no significant assay interference was demonstrated with K2-EDTA
and lithium heparin at the indicated test concentrations. Results are summarized in the table
below:

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The claimed measuring range is from 3.0 U/mL to 600 U/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The traceability and reagent stability were established in K020828.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the
ADVIA Centaur CA 125II assay were determined in accordance with the CLSI guideline
EP17-A2.
The LoB was determined using two lots of reagents and one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument.
Five analyte-free human serum samples were tested in five replicates per run, two runs per
day for five days, to obtain a total of 250 replicates per lot. The LoB was estimated as the
95th percentile of the measurements and determined to be 0.18 U/mL and 0.61 U/mL for the
two lots of reagents. The claimed LoB is 2.0 U/mL.
The LoD was determined using 15 serum pools with low analyte levels (0.09−16.67 U/mL).
Each sample was tested in five replicates per run, two runs per day, for five days on one
ADVIA Centaur XP instrument using two lots of reagents to obtain a total of 750 replicates
per lot for all 15 samples. The LoD was determined as 0.73 U/mL and 0.67 U/mL for the two
lots of reagents. The claimed LoD is 3.0 U/mL.
The LoQ was determined using the same set of 15 serum pools with low analyte levels. Each
sample was tested in five replicates per run, two runs per day, for five days on one ADVIA
Centaur XP instrument using two lots of reagents to obtain a total of 750 replicates per lot for
all 15 samples. The LoQ defined as the mean value of the sample which fulfills the
specification for the total within-laboratory imprecision ≤ 20% CV is 0.18 U/mL and 0.13
U/mL for the two lots of reagents. The claimed LoQ is 3.0 U/mL which is the lower limit of
the measuring range claimed for the assay.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The cutoff of the assay was demonstrated in K020828.

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison with the predicate device was presented in K020828. Results from
this study were re-analyzed to determine the relationship of the ADVIA Centaur CA 125II
assay to the Bayer Immuno-1 CA 125II assay. A total of 227 serum samples with CA 125
concentrations ranging from 2.3 to 466.6 U/mL were tested. Because the lower limit of the
measuring range was raised from 2.0 U/mL to 3.0 U/mL, three samples with CA 125
concentrations below 3.0 U/mL were excluded from the analysis. A Deming regression
analysis was performed for the remaining 224 samples and the results are summarized in the
following table:
Sample Range Slope Intercept Correlation
Comparison N
(U/mL) (95% CI) (95% CI) Coefficient (r)
ADVIA Centaur CA 125II 1.03 1.15
224 3.1–466.6 0.99
vs. Immuno-1 CA 125II (1.01–1.04) (-0.81–3.11)
N = Number of samples tested
2. Matrix Comparison:
To demonstrate that Li-Heparin plasma and K2-EDTA plasma samples yield results
comparable with serum samples by the ADVIA Centaur CA 125II assay, a study was
performed by using 162 serum/K2-EDTA plasma paired samples (153 native and 9 pooled
samples) and 135 serum/Li-heparin plasma paired samples (112 native and 8 pooled
samples). Paired samples were each tested in singleton on ADVIA Centaur XP system. The
Deming regression analysis was performed, and the results are summarized in the following
table:
Sample Range Slope Intercept Correlation
Comparison N
(U/mL) (95% CI) (95% CI) Coefficient (r)
K2-EDTA plasma 0.95 -0.4
162 3.0–572.7 1.00
vs. serum (0.92–0.98) (-1.50–0.72)

119 3.1–572.7 1.00
plasma vs. serum (0.98–1.07) (-1.55–1.32)

The data support the addition of K2-EDTA plasma and Li-heparin plasma sample types to
the ADVIA Centaur CA 125II assay.
