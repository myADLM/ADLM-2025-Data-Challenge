2 2
Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), Methemoglobin (MetHb), and Deoxyhemoglobin (HHb)

III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer System is indicated for use by healthcare professionals in
clinical laboratory settings and for point-of-care usage for quantitative determination of
Hematocrit, Oxygen Saturation, Total Hemoglobin, Oxyhemoglobin, Carboxyhemoglobin,
Methemoglobin, and Deoxyhemoglobin in heparinized arterial and venous whole blood.
Hematocrit (Hct) measurements of the packed red blood cell volume are used to distinguish
normal from abnormal states, such as anemia and erythrocytosis.
Oxygen Saturation (sO2) measurements are used to assess the oxygenation of the hemoglobin
and the adequacy of tissue oxygenation in the evaluation of pulmonary function. Measurements
are also used to diagnose and treat cyanosis.
Total Hemoglobin (tHb) measurements are used in the evaluation of chronic and acute anemia as
well as the oxygen transport capability of the hemoglobin.
Oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) measurements are used to assess pulmonary function in combination
with Deoxyhemoglobin and are also used in the diagnosis and treatment of cyanosis.
Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) measurements are used to determine if and to what level carbon
monoxide has been inhaled by the patient. High levels of carbon monoxide can lead to tissue
anoxia and death.
Methemoglobin (MetHb) measurements are used to determine congenital methe- moglobinemia
or determine the ingestion of nitrates, chlorates, or any other drug or chemical that can cause
methemoglobin formation. High levels of methemoglobin can lead to cyanosis and death.
Deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) measurements are used to assess pulmonary function in combination
with Oxyhemoglobin.

D Special Instrument Requirements:
Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer System is a small automatic blood gas analyzer for
laboratory and point of care setting. It consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges, calibrator
packs, auto-cartridge quality control packs (internal controls), ampuled quality control materials
(external controls) and thermal paper for an onboard printer. Specimens may be identified by
scanning a barcode or by manually entering the information via the touchscreen.
The Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges (Primary
and Auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by detecting which
sensor cards are installed. The reporting of CO-Oximeter parameters (or not reporting them) will
also be determined by the selection of the Sensor Cards, for which there are two options:
• Primary Sensor Card 1 reports the following analytes: pO , pCO , pH, Na, Cl, K, iCa, iMg,
2 2
Glu, tBil, Hct, tHb, sO , O Hb, COHb, MetHb, HHb
2 2
• Primary Sensor Card 2 reports the following analytes: pO , pCO , pH, Na, Cl, K, iCa, iMg,
2 2
Glu, Hct, tHb, sO
2
B Principle of Operation:
Oxygen saturation (sO ) represents the percent of hemoglobin bound to oxygen, expressed as a
2
fraction of the amount of hemoglobin capable of binding to oxygen (oxyhemoglobin plus
deoxyhemoglobin). As the level of SO changes within a blood sample, the optical absorbance of
2
the whole blood changes.
Hematocrit (Hct) is defined as the percentage of red blood cells to the total blood volume and is
measured by the electrical resistance of the blood sample. The hematocrit value is corrected for
the concentration of the sodium ion.
Total Hemoglobin (tHb) is measured by optical absorbance, and is the sum of all measured
hemoglobin fractions expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in a specified volume of whole
blood.
Oxyhemoglobin (O Hb) is measured by optical absorbance, and is the combined form of
2
hemoglobin and oxygen.
Carboxyhemoglobin is measured by optical absorbance, and is the combined form of carbon
monoxide and hemoglobin.
Methemoglobin is measured by optical absorbance, and is the form of hemoglobin in which the
iron has been oxidized from the ferrous to the ferric state.
K200204 - Page 3 of 14

--- Page 4 ---
Deoxyhemoglobin is measured by optical absorbance, and is the form of hemoglobin that is not
combined with oxygen but can easily uptake oxygen in the lungs.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer System for Hct, sO ,
2
tHb, O Hb, COHb, MetHb, and HHb for POC use was established in three separate studies
2
using methods described in CLSI EP5-A2. The studies were conducted at three POC sites: a
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, an Emergency Department and a Respiratory Therapy
Lab. Across all three studies, a total of 61 respiratory care, 12 nursing, and 1 exercise
physiology POC personnel participated.
Within-run precision using controls
A three site POC within-run precision (repeatability) study of the Stat Profile® Plus Analyzer
System for Hct, SO , tHb, O Hb, COHb, MetHb, and HHb was conducted by testing three
2 2
levels of quality control material and/or two levels of linearity materials. At each site, the
samples were assayed in replicates of 20 using one analyzer for a total of three Stat Profile®
Plus Analyzer Systems and 60 measurements per sample. All three POC sites produced
similar results. Representative within-run precision results from one site are summarized in
the tables below:

Within-run precision using whole blood
A three site POC within-run precision (repeatability) study of the Stat Profile® Plus Analyzer
System for Hct, sO , tHb, O Hb, COHb, MetHb, and HHb was conducted by testing five
2 2
levels of analytes in native whole blood samples and two levels of analytes in altered whole
blood samples. At each site, the samples were assayed in replicates of 10 using one analyzer
for a total of three Stat Profile® Plus Analyzer Systems and 30 measurements per sample. A
minimum of two operators at each site for a total of 9 operators conducted the testing. The
results from each site are presented in the tables below.

Total precision
A three site POC total precision study of the Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer for Hct, sO ,
2
tHb, O Hb, COHb, MetHb, and HHb was conducted using three levels of QC materials and
2
one Stat Profile® Plus Analyzer System per site. For each run, each sample was run in
duplicate each day for a total of 20 days for a total of 40 results per site. The results were
analyzed per site for within-run precision (repeatability) and for total precision (combined
within-run and run-to-run). All three POC sites produced similar results. Representative
results from one site are summarized in the tables below:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The accuracy performance of the Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer System for Hct, sO ,
2
tHb, O Hb, COHb, MetHb, and HHb was established with a method comparison study by
2
assessing agreement with the predicate device. The method comparison studies were
conducted at three POC sites: a Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, an Emergency
Department, and a Respiratory Therapy Lab. Samples of lithium heparinized arterial and
venous whole blood were analyzed in singlicate using three Stat Profile® Prime Plus
analyzers (one at each site). Across all sites, specimen handling and analysis was performed
by 65 POC operators over a period of 20 testing days. In order to cover the claimed
measuring range for each analyte, less than 10% of samples for each analyte were altered.
The results obtained by POC operators were compared to the results obtained by trained
healthcare professionals from the same whole blood specimens testing with the predicate
device. Each of the three sites produced similar method comparison data. Linear regression
analysis for venous and arterial whole blood results with all POC sites combined is presented
in the table below.
