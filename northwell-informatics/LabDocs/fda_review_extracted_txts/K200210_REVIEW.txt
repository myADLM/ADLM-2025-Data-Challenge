with sodium azide (0.1%) and preservatives
ADVIA Centaur ThCG ReadyPack primary reagent pack; Solid Phase Reagent 22.5 mL/reagent
pack monoclonal mouse anti-hCG antibody (~0.02 mg/mL) covalently coupled to paramagnetic
particles in buffered saline with sodium azide (0.1%) and preservatives
ADVIA Centaur ThCG ReadyPack ancillary reagent pack; ThCG Diluent 25.0 mL/reagent pack
buffered heat-treated equine serum with EDTA, sodium azide (< 0.1%), and preservatives

B Principle of Operation:
The ADVIA Centaur® Total hCG (ThCG) assay uses constant amounts of two antibodies. The
first antibody, in the Lite Reagent, is a polyclonal goat anti-hCG antibody. The second antibody,
in the Solid Phase, is a purified monoclonal mouse anti-hCG antibody. These two antibodies are
specific for different epitopes that are present on both the free ß-subunit and the ß-subunit of
intact hCG.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the ADVIA Centaur® Total hCG assay was performed following
recommendations in CLSI EP06- A guideline. Thirteen (13) samples were prepared by serially
diluting a high hCG concentration sample with a low concentration serum sample. The study was
performed using one (1) reagent lot and three replicates per level on one ADVIA Centaur XP system.
Linearity was evaluated using weighted linear regression. The linearity study included samples
spanning hCG concentrations from 1.7 to 1126 mIU/mL.
The expected and recovered hCG were plotted and gave the following linear regression
equation:
Observed = 0.99(Expected) + 0.12 mIU/mL
The results from the linearity study support an analytical measuring range from 4.0 mIU/mL
to 1000 mIU/mL.
Dilution Recovery
The sponsor provided dilution studies which supported the measurement of samples above
1000 mIU/mL for samples diluted by a factor of 2, 4, 8 or 16.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interferences
Interference testing was conducted following recommendations in CLSI EP07 guideline. To
test the interferents listed below, two (2) female human serum pools were prepared by
spiking a female serum sample pool with a high concentration hCG serum sample pool from
a pregnant female to create a low (around 5.0 mIU/mL) and a high (around 500 mIU/mL)
concentration level sample pool. These base pools were divided further into two parts for
each interferent; a control sample with no interferent present (spiked with interferent vehicle
only) and a spiked sample with interferent present. The interferents were tested at multiple
concentrations as presented below including a low and/or mid and/or a high-level
concentration. Testing was done with two (2) ADVIA Centaur ThCG reagent lots on one (1)
ADVIA Centaur XP system with four (4) replicates.
The observed interference effect, Dobs, was computed as the difference between the means
of the test and control samples.
Dobs = Interference = (test sample mean – control sample mean)
To report the level of interferent for a quantitative assay as percent (%) bias, the following
calculation was used:
% Bias = [100* Dobs ] / [control sample mean]
There was no significant interference (defined by the sponsor as ≤10% bias) up to the
concentrations summarized below:

Hook Effect
No high dose hook effect was observed up to 500,000 mIU/mL.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay analytical measuring interval ranges from 4.0 mIU/mL to 1000 mIU/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The ADVIA Centaur Total hCG assay is traceable to the World Health Organization WHO
5th IS 7/364 reference material.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
evaluated to determine detection capabilities using the ADVIA Centaur® XP System
according to internal procedure governed by CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
Limit of Blank
LoB testing was performed using two (2) reagent lots on one (1) ADVIA Centaur XP
instrument. The study consisted of four (4) blank samples (various diluent pools with no
detectable level of hCG) that were tested in 5 replicates per sample, 2 runs per day, and 5 test
days for a total of 200 replicates per reagent lot. Results were calculated using two-point
calibration stored from first day of testing. The maximum observed LoB across all reagent
lots was 1.14 mIU/mL.
Limit of Detection
LoD testing was performed using two (2) reagent lots on one (1) ADVIA Centaur® XP
instrument. The study consisted of 10 samples that were tested in 5 replicates per sample per
run, 2 runs per day, and 5 test days. Results were calculated using two-point calibration
stored from first day of testing.
For each reagent lot, LoD was determined using 694 determinations and an LoB of 1.14
mIU/mL. Using the precision profile protocol, the LoD was determined as the dose at which
95% of the measurements would be greater than the LoB. The highest LoB was used in the
calculations of the LoD. The maximum observed LoD across all reagent lots was 1.99
mIU/mL.
K200210 - Page 7 of 9

--- Page 8 ---
Limit of Quantitation
LoQ was determined by testing six human low concentration serum sample pools in the hCG
concentration range of 1.4 - 8.2 mIU/mL. Testing was performed on two (2) ADVIA
Centaur® reagents lots on one ADVIA Centaur XP system. Each sample was tested in five
(5) replicates for ten (10) runs over a period of five (5) days, yielding a total of 300
determinations for each reagent lot. The largest LoQ observed result across all reagent lots
tested was 3.9 mIU/mL and the sponsor claimed LoQ is 4.0 mIU/mL. The LoQ study
incorporated both precision and a bias component with a 30% error limit.
