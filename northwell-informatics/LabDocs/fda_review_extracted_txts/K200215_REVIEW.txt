B Principle of Operation:
The ADVlA Centaur CEA Assay is a fully automated, single-wash sandwich immunoassay using
direct, chemiluminescent technology. The Lite Reagent is composed of the polyclonal rabbit
anti-CEA antibody labeled with acridinium ester. The Solid Phase Reagent is composed of
monoclonal mouse anti-CEA antibody covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles. The sample
is incubated with the Lite Reagent and Solid Phase Reagent for 7.5 minutes at 37 °C to allow
formed immune complexes to be captured by the particles. After incubation, the particles are
washed before addition of the Acid Reagent and Base Reagent to initiate the chemiluminescent
reaction. The measured chemiluminescence is directly proportional to the quantity of CEA
antigen in the sample.

The precision and reproducibility of the ADVIA Centaur CEA Assay were demonstrated in
K981478.
2. Linearity:
The linearity of the ADVIA Centaur CEA Assay was demonstrated in K981478.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity was demonstrated in K981478. Interference was evaluated with
hemoglobin, triglycerides, bilirubin and chemotherapeutic agents. The potential interference
of NCA (normal cross-reacting antigen) and NCA2 was also evaluated.
To evaluate the performance of the ADVIA Centaur CEA Assay in samples collected with
K2-EDTA and lithium heparin tubes, one sample at low level and one at high level of CEA
for each matrix were used to titrate the EDTA and heparin anticoagulants. The nominal K2-
EDTA and lithium heparin concentrations are 1.8 mg/mL and 15.0 U/mL in blood collection
tubes, respectively. Both K2-EDTA and lithium heparin samples were spiked at three times
and five times the nominal additive concentration for testing. Testing was performed in three
replicates per sample on one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument using one lot of reagent. The
recovery was calculated as the difference between the means of the test samples spiked with
the interferent and control samples spiked with the same volume of the interferent vehicle.
Results summarized in the table below show that no significant assay interference was
demonstrated with K2-EDTA and lithium heparin at the indicated test concentrations.

The traceability and reagent stability were established in K981478.

ADVIA Centaur CEA Assay were determined in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-

The LoB was determined using two lots of reagents and one ADVIA Centaur XP instrument.
Five analyte-free human serum pools were tested in five replicates per run, two runs per day
for five days, to obtain a total of 250 replicates per lot. The LoB was estimated as the 95th
percentile of the measurements and determined to be 0.15 ng/mL and 0.36 ng/mL for the two
lots of reagents. The claimed LoB is 0.5 ng/mL.
The LoD was determined using 10 serum pools with low analyte levels on one ADVIA
Centaur XP instrument using two lots of reagents. All samples were tested in five replicates
per sample for ten runs over a period of five days yielding a total of 500 replicates per
reagent lot. The LoD was determined as 0.46 ng/mL and 0.48 ng/mL for the two lots of
reagents. The claimed LoD is 1.0 ng/mL.
The LoQ was determined using 10 serum pools with low analyte levels on one ADVIA
Centaur XP instrument using two lots of reagents. All samples were tested in five replicates
per sample for ten runs over a period of five days yielding a total of 500 replicates per
reagent lot. The LoQ defined as the mean value of the sample which fulfills the specification
for the total within-laboratory imprecision ≤ 20% CV is 0.29 ng/mL and 0.43 ng/mL for the
two lots of reagents. The claimed LoQ is 2.0 ng/mL which is the lower limit of the measuring
range claimed for the assay.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay cut-off was demonstrated in K981478.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison with predicate device was presented in K981478. Results from this
study were re-analyzed to determine the relationship of the ADVIA Centaur CEA assay to
the ACS:180 CEA assay. A total of 284 samples with CEA concentrations ranging from 0.5
to 78.5 ng/mL were tested. Because the lower limit of the measuring range was raised from
0.5 ng/mL to 2.0 ng/mL, 83 samples with CEA concentrations below 2.0 ng/mL were
removed from the analysis. A Deming regression analysis was performed for the remaining
201 samples and the results are summarized in the following table:

2. Matrix Comparison:
To demonstrate that Li-Heparin plasma and K2-EDTA plasma samples yield results
comparable with serum samples by the ADVIA Centaur CEA Assay, a study was performed
by using 64 serum/K2-EDTA plasma paired samples (59 native samples and five pooled

samples). The pooled sample pairs were prepared by mixing high CEA and low CEA native
human matched pairs. Paired samples were each tested in singleton using five reagent lots on
three ADVIA Centaur XP instruments. The Deming regression analysis was performed, and
the results are summarized in the following table:
