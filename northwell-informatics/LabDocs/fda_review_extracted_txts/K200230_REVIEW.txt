B Principle of Operation:
Aptiva Celiac Disease IgG Reagent kit contains two different populations of particles; one
particle coated with recombinant tissue transglutaminase antigen and one particle coated with a
synthetic deamidated gliadin peptide and an additional third particle coated with goat anti-human
IgG antibody as control verification.
The Aptiva System dilutes the patient sample 1:23 then combines an aliquot of diluted patient
sample, and reagent into a cuvette. The mixture is incubated at 37°C. After a wash cycle,
conjugated anti-human IgG antibody is added to the particles and this mixture is incubated at
37°C. Excess conjugate is removed in another wash cycle, and the particles are re-suspended in
system fluid.
The system generates multiple images in order to identify and count the two unique analyte
particles, as well as determine the amount of conjugate on each particle. A third particle, coated
with goat anti-human IgG antibodies, is present in the reagent as a control to flag low
concentrations of IgG in the sample as an assay verification step. The median fluorescent
intensity (MFI) for each analyte is proportional to the concentration of conjugate bound to
human IgG, which is proportional to the concentration of IgG antibodies bound to the
corresponding particle region. The system uses the MFI from at least 50 particles of each region.
The identity of the particles is determined by the unique signature of the particles.
Each analyte in the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgG Reagent is assigned a predefined lot specific
Master Curve. The analyte specific Master Curve is stored on the reagent cartridge RFID label
(Radio-frequency identification). Based on results obtained by running calibrators (supplied
separately), the system creates instrument specific Working Curves. Working curves are used by
the software to calculate Fluorescent Light Units (FLU) for each analyte from the MFI values
obtained for each sample.
Based on the defined cut-off for each analyte, the test results are reported for each sample as
“positive” or “negative” with test value in FLU for each assay, i.e., DGP IgG and tTG IgG.

2. Linearity:
The linearity across the analytical measuring range (AMR) of each analyte was evaluated in
accordance with CLSI EP6-A. The study was done by using four human serum samples with
various anti-DGP and anti-tTG antibody concentrations which were combined with another
human serum sample containing low levels of antibodies in 10% increments (from 0% to
90% of low sample) to obtain values that cover the entire AMR. Each dilution was tested in
duplicate. Percentage recovery of obtained mean results was calculated compared to the
expected results. Results were analyzed according to the guideline performing regression
analysis and identifying the best fitting polynomial.
The linear regression analysis was performed using the samples falling within the master
curve and the results of samples within AMR are summarized in the following tables:

For the anti-tTG IgG assay, the data support linearity for the claimed AMR from 0.82 FLU to
250.00 FLU
Auto-rerun:
To validate the auto-rerun function with 1:10 dilutions, two positive specimens with anti-
DGP IgG (599.54 and 1085.45 FLU) and two positive specimens with anti-tTG IgG (1266.11
and 1705.55 FLU) concentrations well above the assay measuring range were run with the
auto-rerun function enabled on the Aptiva instrument. The same set of samples were
manually diluted 1:10, tested and used as reference values. Comparing the values obtained by
the auto-rerun to the manual dilution, the recovery values ranged from 91.4% to 94.1% for
DGP IgG, and 89.4% to 99.9% for tTG IgG.
Hook Effect:
The possibility of hook effect for Aptiva Celiac Disease IgG Reagent on the Aptiva System
was evaluated with testing three anti-DGP IgG high positive samples (378.94, 379.85 and
723.10 FLU) and three high positive samples with anti-tTG IgG (264.21, 405.53 and 465.52
FLU). No antigen excess hook effect was observed up to 723.10 FLU for DGP IgG and up to
465.52 FLU for tTG IgG.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
An interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 using a set of three human
serum specimens for DGP IgG: one positive (12.64 FLU), one near the cut-off (5.31 FLU)
and one negative (1.14 FLU), and three serum specimens for tTG IgG: one positive (46.65
FLU); one near the cut-off (5.22 FLU); and one negative (2.29 FLU). Each sample was tested
in triplicate with the spiked interfering substances in the table below. The percent (%)
recovery for the sample spiked with the potential interfering substance was calculated by
comparing its result to that of the corresponding control sample without the interfering
substance. For both assays, no significant interference (defined as % recovery between 90–
110%) was observed in: 1 mg/mL for bilirubin, 2 mg/mL for hemoglobin, 1000 mg/dL for
triglycerides, 332.5 mg/dL for cholesterol, and 250 IU/mL for rheumatoid factor (IgM). In
the DGP assay, human IgG at a concentration of 35 mg/mL showed % recovery of 114.1% in
the sample around the cut-off.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
DGP IgG assay: 0.56 FLU–250.00 FLU
tTG IgG assay: 0.82 FLU–250.00 FLU
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
There is no international reference material for anti-DGP or anti-tTG IgG antibodies that
allows for the standardization of anti-DGP or anti-tTG IgG antibodies detection assays.
Calibrator and control values are directly traceable to in-house standards that are used to
create the master curves for the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgG Reagent.
Stability:
Kit stability (unopened): An accelerated stability study the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgG
Reagent was performed using three lots stored at 37°C±3°C for 5 weeks where one week is
equal to 6 months at 5±3°C. Seven samples were run in duplicate for DGP IgG, and 12
samples run in duplicate for tTG IgG. The accelerated stability study supports a claim for a
24-month shelf-life.
Real time: Real-time stability study was performed at 3–6-month intervals on the Aptiva
Celiac Disease IgG reagents stored at 2–8°C. At each timepoint, a low positive sample, a
moderately high sample and a high positive patient sample (DGP IgG: 5.83, 12.58 and 47.14
FLU; and tTG IgG: 8.09, 15.03 and 51.23 FLU) were tested at time zero, 7 months, 12
months, 20 months, 24 months, and 25 months. The two lots support a 24-month stability
claim.
On-board (In-use) stability: An on-board stability study was performed for the reagent
cartridge. One lot of the reagent cartridge was tested using a set of human serum samples:
seven DGP IgG; 12 tTG IgG. In addition, 14 samples of IgG Control bead were tested. The
specimens were tested periodically for 31 days at each timepoint with a total of 12 timepoints
for the DGP IgG, tTG IgG reagent cartridges and IgG Control beads. At day 15, the reagent
cartridge was recalibrated. The results support an on-board stability claim of 28 days.
Sample stability: Six samples ranging from 4.1 FLU to 103.7 FLU for DGP IgG and seven
samples ranging from 2.7 FLU to 110.4 FLU for tTG IgG were tested. All samples were
tested in duplicate for up to 21 days while stored at 2–8°C, up to 48 hours while stored at
room temperature (RT), and after repeated freeze/thaw cycles up to six cycles. Results were
compared to those obtained on control samples (time zero / zero cycles). The results support
sample stability for 48 hours at RT, 14 days at 2–8°C, and up to five freeze/thaw cycles when
samples are stored at or below -20°C.

6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying eight blank samples in five replicates
per sample over three days with two reagent lots. One hundred twenty data points were
generated for each lot. LoB was calculated as the 95th percentile using the non-parametric
method for each lot as the dataset showed non-normal distribution. The highest LoB was
determined to be 0.02 FLU for both DGP IgG and tTG IgG.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by using four samples with low level of anti-
DGP IgG and anti-tTG IgG antibodies. Each sample was tested in five replicates over three
days with two reagent lots. LoD was calculated as the LoB+1.652 x SD of the replicates for
the samples. The LoD was determined to be 0.15 FLU for DGP IgG and 0.13 FLU for tTG
IgG.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by assaying four low level samples of anti-
DGP IgG and anti-tTG IgG with two reagent lots. Each sample was run in replicates of five,
twice per day, for three days, with a total of 120 data points generated on each assay, on each
reagent lot. The LoQ was defined to be the lowest concentration level that meets the within-
laboratory imprecision of < 20% for each lot. The LoQ for each assay was determined as the
highest LoQ across the two lots and set as the lower limit of the AMR. The claimed LoQ is
0.56 FLU for the DGP IgG assay and 0.82 FLU for the tTG IgG assay.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The Aptiva Celiac Disease IgG Reagent cut-off was established by testing 11 celiac disease
samples and 192 presumably negative autoimmune disease samples [30 infectious disease, 20
systemic sclerosis, 13 systemic lupus erythematosus, 15 Crohn’s disease, 29 autoimmune
thyroid disease, 30 primary biliary cholangitis, 40 rheumatoid arthritis, and 15 ulcerative
colitis samples]. The assay cut-off was established as 5.00 FLU (109 MFI for DGP IgG and
175 MFI for tTG IgG) to ensure optimal differentiation between DGP IgG and tTG IgG
positive and negative samples.
For both DGP IgG and tTG IgG, an interpretation of “positive” is for samples ≥ 5.00 FLU
and an interpretation of “negative” is for samples with FLU < 5.00 FLU.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
All samples (n=515) from the clinical validation study (described in Section C.1. below)
were tested on the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgG Reagent and on their predicates, the QUANTA
Flash DGP IgG and tTG IgG assays. Among them, 218 samples have anti-DGP IgG levels
within the AMR for DGP IgG of the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgG Reagent and the QUANTA
Flash DGP IgG, and 265 samples have anti-tTG IgG levels within the AMR for tTG IgG of
the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgG Reagent and the QUANTA Flash tTG IgG. The positive
percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA) and total percent agreement
(TPA) were calculated by comparing the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgG Reagent with the
predicate devices on samples within the AMR. The results are summarized in the following
tables for each analyte.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A panel of 120 apparently healthy blood donors (64 females/56 males, ages 17 to 57 years, with
an average and median age of 32 years) were tested on the Aptiva Celiac Disease IgG Reagent.
For DGP IgG, with a cut-off of 5.00 FLU, the cohort ranged from 0.03 to 8.06 FLU; three
samples were positive.
For tTG IgG, with a cut-off of 5.00 FLU, the cohort ranged from 0.05 to 3.76 FLU; no samples
were positive.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
