IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ImmunoCAP system is a fully integrated and automated system for the determination of
specific IgE in human blood serum or plasma samples. It is comprised of general, and test- and
method-specific reagents for Phadia test system modules, as well as instrument and data
management software.
The general ImmunoCAP reagents include ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Conjugate, ImmunoCAP
Specific IgE Curve Control, ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Calibrators, Specific IgE anti-IgE
ImmunoCAP, Allergen ImmunoCAP carriers, ImmunoCAP development solution and stop
solution. The method-specific reagents consist of individual purified allergens (native or
recombinant) covalently coupled to a support in a plastic housing.
B Principle of Operation:
The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts with the specific
IgE in the patient sample. After washing away nonspecific IgE, enzyme-labeled antibodies
against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-IgE is washed
away and the bound complex is then incubated with a developing agent. After stopping the
reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
i) Inhibition studies:
Immunological specificity of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal was verified by
performing competitive inhibition studies in accordance with I/LA-20 3rd Edition. A
positive sample with known concentration of IgE specific to allergen component o215
(4.8 kU /L) was tested. Equal volumes of the positive sample and varying serial dilutions
A
of the specific allergen component o215 in solution were premixed. The mixture was
incubated in a sample tube at room temperature for two hours before being analyzed with
ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal on the Phadia 250 according to the ImmunoCAP
Specific IgE, Directions for Use. The testing was performed in duplicate in one assay run.
Mean values (in kU /L) were calculated. The inhibition values in % were calculated
A
according to the formula below:
r = concentration [kU /L]
A
b = background concentration (100% inhibition) [kU /L]
A
t = total concentration (0% inhibition) [kU /L]
A
i = inhibition
Results from the dose-dependent inhibition study showed that >50% inhibition was
achieved with the specific allergen component o215 in solution at a concentration of 6.5
pmol/µL.
To further evaluate the immunological specificity of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-
Gal, three allergens from different or unrelated allergen groups [nGal d 1 (ovomucoid),
Pla l 1 (Plantain) and rPhl p 11 (grass pollen)] and one allergen from the same or related
allergen group [cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCD)] were tested at doses that
are 10-fold or higher than the specific allergen component concentration that yielded

>50% inhibition. None of the allergens tested show any significant inhibition. The
inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen o215 solid phase contains the
immunologically relevant allergen component.
ii) Interference:
a) Endogenous Substance Interference:
Interferences were assessed by testing two positive samples and one negative sample.
Each sample was spiked with the interfering substances or substance-specific diluents
and analyzed in four replicates in one assay run using the Phadia 250 according to the
ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use. The data demonstrated that
ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal was not adversely affected by high levels of
the following substances up to the concentrations listed in the table below:
Interferent No inhibition up to the tested concentrations
Bilirubin, unconjugated 327.0 μmol/L
Bilirubin, conjugated 363.0 μmol/L
Chyle 1610.0 FTU (Formazine Turbidity Units)
Hemoglobin 4.9 g/L
Rheumatoid factor 550 IU/mL
b) Exogenous Substance Interference:
Two literature references were provided supporting the claim that commonly
prescribed allergy medications do not interfere with ImmunoCAP Specific IgE. The
references included (i) Robert G. Hamilton, Accuracy of US Food and Drug
Administration-cleared IgE antibody assays in the presence of anti-IgE (omalizumab),
J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 759-766, and (ii) Linda Cox et. al., Pearls and
pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing: report from the American College of Allergy,
Asthma and Immunology/ American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology
Specific IgE Test Task Force, Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, 2008;
101:580-592.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The claimed measuring range is from 0.1 to 86.3 kU /L.
A
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
i) Traceability:
The IgE calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the 2nd
International Reference Preparation (IRP) 75/502 or the equivalent 3rd International
Standard 11/234 of Human Serum Immunoglobulin E from World Health Organization
(WHO).

ii) Kit Stability:
A real-time stability study was performed using three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215,
alpha-Gal in accordance with CLSI EP25-A to demonstrate shelf-life stability (from the
date of manufacture). The stability data support 24 months unopened shelf-life stability.
The studies to determine the stability of the calibration curve calibrators, real-time, and
on-board stability of ImmunoCAP IgE calibrator are described in K100999.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
determined on the Phadia 250 in alignment with the CLSI guideline EP17-A2 using two lots
of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal.
The LoB was determined by testing five blank samples in three runs with five replicates per
run to yield a total of 75 replicates per lot for all samples. The LoB was estimated as the 95%
percentile of the distribution and determined as 0 kU /L and 0.013 kU /L for the two lots of
A A
ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal. The claimed LoB is 0.013 kU /L.
A
The LoD was determined by testing five low positive samples in three runs with five
replicates to yield a total of 75 replicates per lot for all samples. The LoD was calculated
according to the equation: LoD = LoB + cß • SDLoD, where SDLoD is the pooled SD for the
samples, and determined as 0.021 kU /L and 0.025 kU /L for the two lots of ImmunoCAP
A A
Allergen o215, alpha-Gal. The claimed LoD is 0.1 kU /L.
A
The LoQ was estimated as the mean value of the sample which fulfills the specification for
the total within-laboratory imprecision ≤ 20% CV. The LoQ was determined as 0.025 kU /L
A
and 0.034 kU /L for the two lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal. The precision
A
profile supports the LoQ claim of 0.1 kU /L which is the lower limit of the measuring range
A
claimed for ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Limit of Quantitation for ImmunoCAP Specific IgE is 0.10 kU /L. All results > 0.1 kU /L
A A
are interpreted as being analytically positive.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Refer to clinical studies.
2. Matrix Comparison:
To demonstrate that K -EDTA plasma samples yield results comparable with serum samples
2
by the ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal, a study was performed by using 40 serum/K2-

EDTA plasma paired samples. None of the samples were contrived. Paired samples were
each tested according to ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use in one replicate in one
assay run on one Phadia 250 instrument using one lot of ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-
Gal. The Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed, and the results are summarized

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Serum samples from 200 patients presenting to the University of Virginia Allergy Clinic with
urticaria, anaphylaxis, or other symptoms following intake of red meat, were evaluated
retrospectively (Study Group A: Allergic to red meat). Sixty allergic individuals without
known alpha-Gal mediated red meat hypersensitivity were included as atopic controls in the
study. Of these, 30 presented known allergies to foods, including animal-derived foods other
than red meat (Study Group B: Atopic controls/ Other foods), and 30 were allergic to
airborne allergens (Study Group C: Atopic controls/ Inhalants). Additionally, samples from
50 individuals, with no history of allergic disease and no evidence of atopic sensitization
(Study Group D: Non-atopic controls), were analyzed. A summary of the demographic data

# Excluding reactions to red meat
The reactions to red meat and dairy products or other foods in Study Group A is summarized in
the table below:
Clinical Features Positive Cases (Positive Rate)
Gastro intestinal (GI) symptoms to red meat 125/9 (63%)
Skin symptoms to red meat 184 (92%)
Anaphylaxis to red meat 111 (56%)
Reactions to dairy products 16 (8%)
Reactions to other food(s) 39 (20%)
Among the patients with a red meat hypersensitivity (Group A), 97.5% (195/200) were found to
be sensitized to alpha-Gal as measured by ImmunoCAP Allergen o215, alpha-Gal. Consistent
with the ubiquitous presence of alpha-Gal in non-primate mammals, more than 75% of these
patients also had specific IgE to other animal allergens tested: 98% were sensitized to beef (f27),
78% to cat dander (e1), 86% to dog dander (e5), 94% to pork (f26) and 93% to cow’s milk (f2).
Consistent with the absence of alpha-Gal in non-mammalian animals, only 5% and 18% were
sensitized to chicken (f83) and egg white (f1), respectively. Among the atopic controls (Study
Groups B and C), 16.7% were sensitized to alpha-Gal. None of the non-atopic controls in Study
Group D showed sensitization either to alpha-Gal or beef.
In total, 195 of 200 patients with a red meat hypersensitivity had specific IgE antibodies to
alpha-Gal, corresponding to a clinical sensitivity of 97.5%. Of the 110 control subjects (60 atopic
and 50 non-atopic), 10 (five food allergic subjects and five inhalant allergic subjects) were
