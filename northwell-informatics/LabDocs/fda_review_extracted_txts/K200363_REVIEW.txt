II Review Summary:
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the submitter's own Class II device
requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable.
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER'S previously cleared device. (For a preamendments
device, a statement to this effect has been provided.)
2. Submitter's statement that the INDICATIONS FOR USE/INTENDED USE of the modified device as
described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes
instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling
changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering drawings,
photographs, user's and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL
SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed. This change was for:
Product labeling to include the percent cross-reactivity of four drug metabolites that may be present in
human urine samples, but not previously tested for cross-reactivity:
• Metharbital, p-Hydroxyphenobarbital, and Talbutal for the Barbiturates assay.
• Alprazolam glucuronide-OH for the Benzodiazepines assay.
4. Comparison Information (i.e., similarities and differences) to the submitter's legally marketed predicate
device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics.
5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the device and
its components, and the results of the analysis.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required,
including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use for the
device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter's description of the particular modification(s)
and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental
scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in
The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to
the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
