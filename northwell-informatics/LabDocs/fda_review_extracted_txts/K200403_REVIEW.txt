variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany (intermittent muscular contractions or
spasms).
Ionized magnesium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of hypomagnesemia
(abnormally low levels of magnesium) and hypermagnesemia (abnormally high levels of
magnesium).

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer System is a small automatic blood gas analyzer for
laboratory and point of care setting. It consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges, calibrator
packs, auto-cartridge quality control packs (internal controls), ampuled quality control materials
(external controls) and thermal paper for an onboard printer. Specimens may be identified by
scanning a barcode or by manually entering the information via the touchscreen.
The Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges (Primary
and Auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by detecting which
sensor cards are installed. The reporting of CO-Oximeter parameters (or not reporting them) will
also be determined by the selection of the Sensor Cards, for which there are two options:
• Primary Sensor Card 1 reports the following analytes: pO , pCO , pH, Hct, tHb, Na, Cl,
2 2
K, iCa, iMg, Glu, SO , O Hb, COHb, MetHb, HHb, tBil, HbF
2 2
• Primary Sensor Card 2 reports the following analytes: pO , pCO , pH, Hct, tHb, Na, Cl,
2 2
K, iCa, iMg, Glu, SO .

B Principle of Operation:
The sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium and ionized magnesium parameters are
measured by an ion-selective electrode (ISE) that selectively measures the activity of ionic
species. When the ISE is contacted with a sample, a potential is developed. The potential is
proportional to the logarithm of the ionic activity and is measured versus a reference electrode,
as described by the Nernst equation.

Respiratory Therapy Lab. A total of 61 respiratory care, 12 nursing, and 1 exercise
physiology POC personnel participated from the 3 POC settings over the course of the
studies.
a) Within-Run Precision using controls
Within-run precision of the Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer System in the hands of
POC operators was assessed using QC levels of Quality Control (QC) materials and one
level of linearity material (LN) to cover the measuring range for each analyte. Each
sample was analyzed in replicates of 20 using three Stat Profile® Prime Plus Analyzer
Systems. All three POC sites produced similar results. Representative within-run
precision results from one site are summarized in the table below:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were conducted at three POC sites - a Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit, an Emergency Department and a Respiratory Therapy Lab. Lithium heparinized
arterial and venous whole blood specimens were analyzed in singlet using three Stat Profile®
Prime Plus analyzers (one at each site) by 65 POC staff members (13, 21 and 31 POC staff
members within each testing site, respectively, including a total of 52 respiratory care, 12
nursing, and 1 exercise physiology POC personnel). In order to cover the claimed measuring
range for each analyte, less than 10% of samples for each analyte were altered. The clinical
results obtained by POC staff members were compared to results obtained by trained
healthcare professionals from the same whole blood specimens. Each of the three sites
produced similar method comparison data. Linear regression analysis for venous and arterial
whole blood method comparison for all POC sites combined is presented in the table below.
