B Indication(s) for Use:
Control-IQ technology is intended for use with compatible integrated continuous glucose
monitors (iCGM) and alternate controller enabled (ACE) pumps to automatically increase,
decrease, and suspend delivery of basal insulin based on iCGM readings and predicted glucose
values. It can also deliver correction boluses when the glucose value is predicted to exceed a
predefined threshold.
Control-IQ technology is intended for the management of Type 1 diabetes mellitus in persons 6
years of age and greater.
Control-IQ technology is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription.
Control-IQ technology is indicated for use with NovoLog or Humalog U-100 insulin.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Only use U-100 Humalog or U-100 NovoLog with your pump. Only U-100 Humalog and
NovoLog have been tested and found to be compatible for use in the pump. Use of insulin with
lesser or greater concentration can result in under delivery or over delivery of insulin. This can
cause hypoglycemia (low BG) or hyperglycemia (high BG) events.
When the CGM reading is automatically populated into the bolus calculator, only the current
CGM reading is used to calculate the correction bolus. The trend arrow is not used in the dose
calculation. Speak with your healthcare provider for recommendations on how best to utilize the
arrows for your correction bolus dosing.
Control-IQ technology should not be used in anyone under the age of six years old. Control-IQ
technology should also not be used in patients who require less than a total daily insulin dose of
10 units per day or who weigh less than 55 pounds, as those are the required minimum values
needed in order for Control-IQ technology to operate safely.
At the time of device authorization, compatible iCGMs include the following: Dexcom G6
iCGM
The t:slim X2 pump, transmitter, and sensor must be removed before Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or diathermy treatment. Exposure to MRI,
CT, or diathermy treatment can damage the components.
DO NOT use Control-IQ technology if you are taking hydroxyurea, a medication used in the
treatment of diseases including cancer and sickle cell anemia. Your Dexcom G6 CGM readings
may be falsely elevated and result in over-delivery of insulin that could result in severe
hypoglycemia.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Control-IQ technology (Control-IQ, the device) is a software-only device intended for use by
people with diabetes. The device controls insulin delivery from a compatible alternate controller
enabled insulin pump (ACE pump) based on inputs provided by a compatible integrated
continuous glucose monitor (iCGM) and inputs provided the user (e.g., carbohydrate intake,
exercise, and sleep schedule). Control-IQ technology is meant to be installed on a compatible
ACE pump.
Control-IQ technology works to control glucose towards a glucose target range of 112.5-160
mg/dL during normal use. Glucose targets are not customizable but can be changed by a user if
sleep or exercise modes are set or announced. During sleep mode, this range is changed to 112.5-
120 mg/dL, and it is changed to 140-160 mg/dL during exercise mode.
Control-IQ technology includes an integrated feature whereby iCGM values are automatically
populated into the glucose field of the integrated bolus calculator when the Control-IQ
technology is active (i.e., the device is operating in closed-loop mode). This feature is disabled
when Control-IQ is turned off.
Using Control-IQ technology requires that users input their weight and their total daily insulin
requirement, which should be established with the help of a health care provider before using the
device.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
Control-IQ technology was previously granted marketing authorization under DEN190034. The
version of Control-IQ technology described in this submission is identical to the predicate
version, with the exception of an expanded intended use population. No modifications were
made to the device in order to accommodate this change.
B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Summary of Clinical Testing:
The sponsor conducted a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled study to compare the
use of Control-IQ technology (or Closed Loop Control, CLC) to the use of sensor-augmented
pump (SAP). The randomized controlled phase (Primary Study) was 4 months in duration,
followed by an Extension Phase of 3 months where all subjects were using the CLC.
A summary of the pivotal clinical study is provided in the following table (Control-IQ group
abbreviated as CLC (closed-loop control)):

• blood ketone level ≥1.0 mmol/L and communication occurred with a health care
provider at the time of the event
• blood ketone level ≥3.0 mmol/L, even if there was no communication with a health care
provider
There were 7 hyperglycemia/ketosis events meeting the above reporting criteria in the CLC arm
compared to 2 in the SAP arm.
Subjects in both study arms were provided with blood ketone meters for use at home. There were
10 recorded events of blood ketone levels >1.0 mmol/L in the CLC arm compared to 6 recorded
events in the SAP arm.
A summary of all reportable adverse events observed during the study is provided in the
following table:

The sponsor performed an evaluation of the Control-IQ technology and determined that it may
not be safe for use in children under the age of six because Control-IQ technology has lower
limits of total daily insulin (≥10 units) and weight requirements (≥55 lbs.). Therefore, the
sponsor has included a warning in the labeling for this device as follows:
“Tandem performed an evaluation of the Control-IQ technology and determined that it may
not be safe for use in children under the age of six because Control-IQ technology has lower
limits of total daily insulin and weight requirements. Therefore, Control-IQ technology
should not be used in anyone under the age of six years old. Control-IQ technology should
also not be used in patients who require less than a total daily insulin dose of 10 units per day
or who weigh less than 55 pounds, as those are the required minimum values needed in order
for Control-IQ technology to operate safely.”

Extension Phase
The primary study was followed by a 3-month single-arm extension phase. Of the 101 subjects
enrolled in the primary study, 100 subjects continued into the extension phase. During the
extension phase, subjects who were originally randomized to the control (SAP) arm of the
primary study were switched to use of the investigational Control-IQ device (CLC arm) such that
all subjects were in the CLC study arm for the extension phase.
Extension Phase Safety Results
There were an additional eight (8) device related hyperglycemia / ketosis events during the
extension phase, and no episodes of DKA or severe hypoglycemia.
Extension Phase Observed Results
Results observed in the extension phase were similar to results observed during the primary
study. Those subjects originally randomized into the CLC arm maintained similar results during
the extension phase. Results for subjects originally randomized in the SAP arm who switched to
the CLC arm are summarized in the table below:

Postmarket Surveillance Study:
There is uncertainty remaining regarding the risk/benefit profile of the device when used in the
broader intended use population. While the premarket clinical study provided to support this
premarket notification showed some benefits, the study included device users and their
caregivers with relatively high levels of education relative to the general use population, and it
was not adequately powered to assess differences in the rates of safety events (e.g., diabetic
ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia). Furthermore, due to the nature of the study design, the
apparent unfavorable difference in the rates of hyperglycemia/ketosis events (not rising to the
level of severity of diabetic ketoacidosis) between the treatment and control arms may be due to
reporting differences between users rather than a true difference from the device itself.
Accordingly, the existing postmarket surveillance study that was ordered for the Control-IQ
device (PS190006, order dated December 13, 2019) will be expanded to include subjects ages 6-
13 years old and to increase the total enrollment in the study to allow for inclusion of this
additional cohort.
Summary of Human Factors Testing for the Expanded Age Range:
As established in DEN190034. The summative human factors study conducted under
DEN190034 included assessment of the 6-13 year pediatric age group, and the results were
found to be acceptable.
