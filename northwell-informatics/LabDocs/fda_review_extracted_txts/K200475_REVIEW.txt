III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The IDS-iSYS Ostase® BAP assay is an in vitro diagnostic device intended for the quantitative
determination of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), an indicator of osteoblastic activity,
in human serum on the IDS system. Results are to be used in conjunction with other clinical and
laboratory data to aid the clinician in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis and
Paget’s disease.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
IDS iSYS Multi-Discipline Automated System (k091849)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The device is a bone alkaline phosphatase assay that consists of a reagent cartridge and one set of
calibrators (CAL A & CAL B). The reagent cartridge contains: MPM1 (Magnetic particles
coated with streptavidin in a phosphate buffer with sodium azide as preservative(<0.09%), (1 x
2.6 mL)); Ab-BIOT Monoclonal anti-BAP labelled with biotin, in buffer containing horse serum
with bovine and mouse proteins and sodium azide as a preservative (<0.09%), (1 x 10.5 mL))
and SUBS (p-nitrophenyl phosphate in a stabilizing buffer containing preservatives (1 x 40 mL)).
B Principle of Operation:
The IDS-iSYS Ostase® BAP assay is a quantitative enzyme immunoassay. The serum sample is
incubated for 15 min in the presence of an antibody linked to biotin, magnetic particles coated to
streptavidin are added and incubated for another 15 min. The BAP/antibody-biotin complex
binds to the magnetic particles. These magnetic particles are captured with magnets and washed
by the washing buffer used into the IDS system. After that, the magnetic particles containing
BAP bound to the antibody are incubated in the presence of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) and
the absorbance is measured during a short time (300 sec) to obtain the kinetic constant in milli
optical density / min at 405 nm. The signal is directly proportional to the amount of BAP present
in the original sample.

2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated based on CLSI EP06-A guideline. A high human serum sample
(70.4 μg/L) and a low human serum sample (2.7 μg/L) were intermixed in different
proportions to create 11 evenly spaced dilutions. The results of this study support the claimed
reportable range of 3 to 70 μg/L.
The linear regression of observed versus the expected concentrations is:
y = 0.98 x - 0.9 ng/mL, R2 = 1.00
Dilution Recovery:
To validate the labeling instructions that patient samples with BAP levels above the claimed
measuring range can be manually diluted 1:2, 4 unique serum samples and 1 contrived
sample were tested. The samples were then diluted 1:2 with the IDS-iSYS Diluent B (IS-
10B) and assayed for recovery and compared to the expected concentration (as determined
by the predicate device). The dilution study results support the sponsor’s labeling claims that
samples with BAP concentrations above 70 μg/L may be diluted manually to obtain results
up to 140 μg/L.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Potential interference from common endogenous substances was evaluated in accordance with
CLSI EP07-A2. To determine interference, two serum samples containing two different
concentrations of BAP were spiked with the potential interferent. Control samples (blank) were
spiked with a volume of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (0 ng/mL) or relevant diluent equal to
that of the spiked interferent. The differences observed between the mean spiked and control
sample values (determined as the mean of 26 replicates) were examined and assessed according
to acceptance criteria. Significant interference was defined as greater than 10% difference
between spiked and control samples.
The following compounds were tested and found not to interfere significantly with the test:

Rheumatoid Factor (Rf) interference was tested by recovery. A sample with known high levels of
rheumatoid factor was spiked into a low and high concentration BAP base sample. The expected
BAP concentration of the Rf sample was calculated through dilution series in an undetectable BAP
matrix buffer. Lower dilution of Rf sample was included to ensure no interference from the Rf on
the value when calculating back to its neat concentration. Significant interference was defined as
greater than 10% difference between spiked and un-spiked samples.
Rf interference was calculated as below:
% Interference = Observed concentration
(Expected conc. from base sample + Expected conc. from Rf sample)
The results are summarized in the following table:
Highest concentration tested that demonstrated no % Interference
significant interference: Low sample High sample
Rheumatoid Factor (RF) 1200 IU/mL 98% 103%
The cholesterol interference was assessed by recovery where a sample with known cholesterol
levels was spiked with 10% and 20% of a high BAP calibrator level. Significant interference was
defined as > ±10% recovery.
The Total Cholesterol interference was calculated as below:
Recovery value = Observed mean spiked value – Observed mean un-spiked value
% Recovery = [Recovery value / Expected Recovery value (Analyte added)] x 100
The highest cholesterol concentration tested that demonstrated no significant interference was 325
mg/dL.
Cross-reactivity
Studies were conducted according to CLSI EP07-A2 to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of
the assay with placental, intestinal and liver ALP. These exogenous cross-reactants were prepared
using a concentrated stock material in matrix containing undetectable BAP and were tested by
spiking into serum samples. The % cross-reactivity was calculated based on following equation:
% cross reactivity = (Mean concentration of spiked sample – mean concentration of un-spiked
sample) x100% Spiked concentration
Cross reactivity results:
Cross-Reactant Spiked Concentration % Cross Reactivity
Liver ALP 750 µg/L 0.1%
Placental ALP 90 U/L 0.5%
Intestinal ALP 500 μg/L 0.0%

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range of the assay is 3 to 70 μg/L, and up to 140 μg/L for diluted samples.
Any value that reads below 3 μg/L is reported as “< 3 μg/L”.
Please see the Linearity and Method Comparison sections and LoQ for details.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The IDS-iSYS Ostase® BAP kit calibrators are traceable to the predicate device via in house
secondary standards (IRs). The sponsor’s traceability scheme was reviewed and found
acceptable.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
determined with following CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
To establish the limit of blank (LoB), each blank sample was measured in duplicate, for a
total of five measurements in a five-day period. A total of 60 replicates per lot was used to
establish the LoB, where each kit lot was tested on a different instrument. A total of 3 kits
lots were tested. Data was analyzed using the parametric statistical method. The LoB was
calculated as 0.3 μg/L.
The LoD was determined using ten (10) samples with very low BAP concentrations. LoD
samples were prepared by diluting human serum with calibrator buffer matrix to achieve 10
sample levels. Each LoD sample was measured in duplicate, for a total of five measurements
in a five-day period. Each kit lot was tested on a different instrument. A total of 3 kit lots
were tested where 94 replicates, 100 replicates and 100 replicates were tested in Lot 1, Lot2
and Lot 3 respectively. Data was analyzed using the parametric statistical method. The LoD
was calculated as 0.4 μg/L.
The LoQ was established using ten (10) samples with low BAP concentration ranging from
approximately 0.2 μg/L to approximately 0.6 μg/L. Samples were prepared by diluting one
human serum sample with calibrator buffer matrix to achieve 10 sample levels. Each LoQ
sample was measured in duplicate, for a total of five measurements in a five-day period.
Each kit lot was tested on a different instrument. A total of 3 kit lots were tested where 96
replicates, 100 replicates and 100 replicates were used in Lot 1, Lot 2 and Lot 3 respectively.
The LoQ was defined based on a precision profile as the concentration where the within-
laboratory %CV is 20%. The LoQ was calculated as 0.5 μg/L.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A total of 160 serum samples were measured by the predicate and candidate methods. For the
predicate device, the mean of duplicates was calculated and reported for each sample as per
the predicate’s instructions for use. For the candidate device, duplicate analysis was
performed and the first singlicate result was used for analysis. Ten samples were excluded
from analysis because either samples were above or below the candidate measuring range,
and or predicate measuring range, or samples were tested in singlicate in the predicate
device. A total of 150 samples were included in the final analysis. Of these, 19 (13%) were
contrived (diluted in the undetectable BAP buffer matrix or spiked with BAP High
Concentrated material) to ensure the full measuring range was covered. The BAP
concentrations ranged from 2.5 to 66.0 µg/L, as measured by the predicate device. Passing-
Bablok regression analysis was performed on the data, giving following results:
