III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The i-STAT CG4+ cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System is intended for use in the in vitro
quantification of pH, PO2, PCO2, and lactate in arterial or venous whole blood in point of care
or clinical laboratory settings.
pH, PO2, and PCO2 measurements are used in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of
respiratory disturbances and metabolic and respiratory-based acid-base disturbances.
Lactate measurements are used in (1) the diagnosis and treatment of lactic acidosis in
conjunction with measurements of blood acid/base status, (2) monitoring tissue hypoxia and
strenuous physical exertion, and (3) diagnosis of hyperlactatemia.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For Point-of-Care or clinical laboratory setting
D Special Instrument Requirements:
i-STAT 1 Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT 1 System is comprised of the i-STAT 1 Analyzer, the i-STAT test cartridges and
accessories (i-STAT 1 Downloader/Recharger, electronic simulator and portable printer). The
system is designed for use by trained medical professionals at the patient point of care or in the
clinical laboratory and is for prescription use only.
The i-STAT CG4+ test cartridge contains test reagents to analyze venous and arterial whole
blood at the point of care or in the clinical laboratory for pH, PO2 (partial pressure of oxygen),
PCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), and lactate. Each i-STAT CG4+ cartridge contains a
reference and ground electrode, and potentiometric and amperometric sensors for the
measurement of specific analytes. It also contains a buffered aqueous calibrant solution with
known concentrations of analytes and preservatives. The test is contained in a single-use,
disposable cartridge. Cartridges require two to three drops of whole blood which are typically
applied to the cartridge using a transfer device.
The i-STAT 1 Analyzer (previously cleared under k103195 as the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer)
is a handheld, in vitro diagnostic analytical device designed to run only i-STAT test cartridges.
The instrument interacts with the cartridge to move fluid across the sensors and generate a
quantitative result.

B Principle of Operation:
pH is measured by direct potentiometry. In the calculation of results for pH, concentration is
related to potential through the Nernst equation.
PO2 is measured amperometrically. The oxygen sensor is similar to a conventional Clark
electrode. Oxygen permeates through a gas permeable membrane from the blood sample into an
internal electrolyte solution where it is reduced at the cathode. The oxygen reduction current is
proportional to the dissolved oxygen concentration.
PCO2 is measured by direct potentiometry. In the calculation of results for PCO2, concentration
is related to potential through the Nernst equation.
Lactate is measured amperometrically. The enzyme lactate oxidase, immobilized in the lactate
biosensor, selectively converts lactate to pyruvate and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The liberated
hydrogen peroxide is oxidized at a platinum electrode to produce a current which is proportional
to the sample lactate concentration.
Temperature “Correction” Algorithm
pH, PO , and PCO are temperature-dependent and are measured at 37°C. The pH, PO ,
2 2 2
and PCO readings at a body temperature other than 37°C can be ‘corrected’ by entering
2
the patient’s temperature on the chart page of the Analyzer. In this case, blood gas results
will be displayed at both 37°C and the patient’s temperature. pH, PO , and PCO at the
2 2
patient’s temperature (T ) are calculated as follows:
p
Calculated Results
The i-STAT 1 Analyzer can be customized to display calculated results. These results are
derived using standard equations with inputs from the directly measured i-STAT sensor
results. These calculations have no effect on the directly measured test results and are
provided for the convenience of the end user who would otherwise perform the
calculation manually.
HCO : HCO (bicarbonate), the most abundant buffer in the blood plasma, is an indicator
3 3
of the buffering capacity of blood. Regulated primarily by the kidneys, HCO is the
3
metabolic component of acid-base balance.
log HCO = pH + log PCO - 7.608
3 2
K200492 - Page 3 of 19

--- Page 4 ---
CO : TCO is a measure of carbon dioxide which exists in several states: CO in physical
2 2 2
solution or loosely bound to proteins, bicarbonate (HCO ) or carbonate (CO ) anions, and
3 3
carbonic acid (H CO ). Measurement of TCO as part of an electrolyte profile is useful
2 3 2
chiefly to evaluate HCO concentration. TCO and HCO are useful in the assessment of
3 2 3
acid-base imbalance (along with pH and PCO ) and electrolyte imbalance. The i-STAT
2
CG4+ can report a calculated TCO according to a simplified and standardized form of the
2
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
TCO = HCO + 0.03PCO
2 3 2
BE: Base excess of the extracellular fluid (ECF) or standard base excess is defined as the
concentration of titratable base minus the concentration of titratable acid when titrating the
average ECF (plasma plus interstitial fluid) to an arterial plasma pH of 7.40 at PCO of 40
2
mmHg at 37 °C. Excess concentration of base in the average ECF remains virtually
constant during acute changes in the PCO and reflects only the non-respiratory component
2
of pH‑disturbances.
BE = HCO - 24.8 + 16.2(pH-7.4)
ecf 3
BE = (1 - 0.014*Hb) * [HCO3 - 24.8 + (1.43 * Hb + 7.7) * (pH - 7.4)]
b
sO : sO (oxygen saturation) is the amount of oxyhemoglobin expressed as a fraction of
2 2
the total amount of hemoglobin able to bind oxygen (oxyhemoglobin plus
deoxyhemoglobin).
sO is calculated from measured PO and pH and from HCO calculated from measured
2 2 3
PCO and pH. However, this calculation assumes normal affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin.
2
It does not take into account erythrocyte diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentrations
which affect the oxygen dissociation curve. The calculation also does not take into account
the effects of fetal hemoglobin or dysfunctional hemoglobins (carboxy-, met-, and
sulfhemoglobin). Clinically significant errors can result from incorporation of such an
estimated sO value for oxygen saturation in further calculations, such as shunt fraction, or
2
by assuming the value obtained is equivalent to fractional oxyhemoglobin.
Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
i-STAT 1 Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
The specimen identification may be manually entered or automatically scanned by the
device.
K200492 - Page 4 of 19

--- Page 5 ---
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The sample type must be selected using the device touchscreen. After the sample type is
selected the on-screen help appears and the help graphics on the device screen vary based on
the sample type selected. The reagent cartridge contains a sample chamber that includes the
sample well and the channel leading from the well up to the fill mark. The cartridge label is
intended to help the operator fill the cartridge correctly. When filled, the sample chamber
contains sufficient sample for testing. Sample volume and placement are monitored by the
instrument and an error message will be generated if filled incorrectly. Either lithium heparin
tube or syringe may be used. Samples should be remixed thoroughly before testing.
4. Calibration:
The CG4+ cartridge includes an on board calibration that is performed with each cartridge
use. The calibrant solution is automatically released from its foil pack and is positioned over
the sensors. The signals produced by the sensors’ responses to the calibrant solution are
measured. This one-point calibration adjusts the offset of the stored calibration curve.
5. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends i-STAT Controls and TriControls for use with the i-STAT CG4+
cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System.

Internal within-site precision (whole blood)
A single site precision study was conducted for PO2, PCO2, pH, and Lactate using samples
targeted to three levels within the test reportable range of each test. Venous whole blood
collected in lithium heparinized tubes from a healthy subject was altered via tonometry
and/or acid/base spiking for PO2, PCO2 and pH and via spiking or plasma replacement for
lactate to prepare the different sample levels. The samples were tested using one lot of i-
STAT CG4+ (blue) cartridges and 60 i-STAT 1 Analyzers. The results of the whole blood
precision are shown below.

Point of Care precision – aqueous control material
A three site point of care precision study was performed using a panel of five aqueous control
solutions containing different levels of pH, PCO2, PO2, and lactate. At each point of care
site, testing was performed a minimum of once per day for five (5) days on six (6) i-STAT 1
Analyzers using six lots of i-STAT CG4+ (blue) cartridges. When a cartridge generated a
star-out (non-reported result) for one assay, an additional cartridge was run to replace the
star-out result, which produced additional test results for other assays. Within-day, between-
day and total variance components were calculated by site. These components were also
calculated for all sites combined and provided in the tables below:

2. Linearity:
The linearity study was designed based on CLSI EP06-A. The linearity of the i-STAT pH,
PO2, PCO2, and Lactate tests in the i-STAT CG4+ (blue) cartridge with the i-STAT 1
System was evaluated by preparing venous whole blood samples collected in lithium heparin
tubes from healthy subjects of varying analyte levels for each i-STAT test. Each sample for
PO2, PCO2, and pH testing was prepared via tonometry to eleven target analyte
concentrations. The number of i-STAT 1 Analyzers used varied; 45 for PO2, 60 for PCO2
and 31 for pH. The total number of cartridge lots used was 13, each i-STAT test utilized at
least 5 of the 13 cartridge lots. Each test sample was tested in replicates of 3 per cartridge lot
for a total of 15 results per level. For lactate, low and high sample levels were prepared by
plasma replacement and spiking, then admixed to prepare nine intermediate whole blood
samples. The eleven lactate test samples were analyzed on 100 i-STAT 1 Analyzers using 5
cartridge lots in replicates of two (2) per cartridge lot for a total of 10 results per level.
The linearity study results support that the assays are linear across the following claimed
reportable ranges:
i-STAT Test Reportable Range
pH 7.0 – 7.7
PO2 5 – 530 mmHg
PCO2 15 – 130 mmHg
Lactate 0.30 – 20.00 mmol/L
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the PO2, PCO2, pH and Lactate tests in the i-STAT CG4+ (blue)
cartridge using the i-STAT 1 system was established by conducting interference testing
following the recommendations in CLSI EP07-A3. Interference from certain exogenous and
endogenous substances was assessed using lithium heparin venous whole blood samples
tonometered to two concentrations of low and high: PO2 (20-40 mmHg and 55-95 mmHg)
PCO2 (20-40 mmHg and 60-80 mmHg) and pH (7.2-7.4 and 7.3-7.5). Lithium heparin
venous whole blood samples were spiked to two concentrations of low and high for lactate
(1.00 ± 0.30 mmol/L and 1.67 ± 0.30 mmol/L). Each low and high sample was further
divided into two aliquots: control (with no added interferent) and test (with added
interferent). Each sample was measured in replicates of at least 10 using six lots of the i-
STAT CG4+ (blue) cartridges. The number of i-STAT 1 Analyzers used varied; 68 for PO2,
67 for PCO2, 80 for pH and 112 for lactate. A substance was identified as an interferent if the
difference in the mean between the control and test sample was outside of the predefined
allowable error:
For PO2: ± greater of 5 mmHg or 10% of the control (mmHg)
For PCO2: ± greater of 5 mmHg or 8% of the control (mmHg)
For pH: ± 0.04 pH units
For Lactate: the greater of ±0.6 mmol/L or ± 12% of the control concentration
(mmol/L)

For those substances that on initial screening were found to interfere with lactate results, dose
response testing was conducted to establish the concentration limit below which no
significant interference is expected. The results are given in the table below:
Substance Concentration Interference
Glycolic Acid ≥ 1.18 mmol/L Increased lactate results
Lithium bromide ≥ 40.7 mmol/L Decreased lactate results
The sponsor includes the following statements in the labeling for the device:
Bromide at 2.5 mmol/L is the peak plasma concentration associated with halothane
anesthesia, in which bromide is released.
Glycolic acid at ≥ 1.18 mmol/L showed increased results.Glycolic acid is a product of
ethylene glycol metabolism. Glycolic acid at a concentration of 10.0 mmol/L can cause
increased i-STAT lactate results. At this level another method should be used to measure
lactate. Unexpected increased lactate concentrations caused by glycolic acid may be a clue to
the possibility of ethylene glycol ingestion as the cause of an otherwise unknown high anion
gap metabolic acidosis. In a study of 35 patients who had ingested ethylene glycol, initial
glycolic acid concentrations of 0 to 38 mmol/L corresponded to ethylene glycol levels of
0.97-30.6 mmol/L.

See section A.2 Linearity.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
pH values assigned to the i-STAT System controls and calibration verification materials are
traceable to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard
reference materials SRMs 186-I, 186-II, 185, and 187.
PO2 values assigned to the i‑STAT controls and calibration verification materials are
traceable to U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard reference
materials via commercially available certified specialty medical gas standards.
PCO2 values assigned to the i‑STAT controls and calibration verification materials are
traceable to U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard reference
materials via commercially available certified specialty medical gas standards.
Lactate values assigned to the i-STAT System controls and calibration verification materials
are traceable to i-STAT System working calibrator prepared from sodium L-lactate (Sigma-
Aldrich Fluka, >99 % purity).
Sample stability
A study was conducted to verify the whole blood sample stability after sample collection
with anticoagulant for i-STAT PO2, PCO2, pH, and Lactate tests using the i-STAT CG4+

(blue) cartridge on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer. The results support the sponsor’s sample stability
claims. The sample stability claims for PO2, PCO2, and pH are 10 minutes for samples with
lithium heparin anticoagulant. The sample stability claim for lactate samples with lithium
heparin anticoagulant is testing the sample immediately after collection.
6. Detection Limit:
The LoB and LoD of the i-STAT Lactate test in the i-STAT CG4+ (blue) cartridge were
evaluated on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer based on CLSI EP17-A2, using whole blood that was
altered to a “blank” lactate concentration for LoB testing and two “low” lactate
concentrations for LoD testing. The studies were conducted across four days by four
operators using two lots of i-STAT CG4+ cartridges and 60 i-STAT 1 Analyzers. The LoB
and LoD were calculated using a parametric data analysis for each of the two lots. The
higher of the two LoB values and LoD values from each lot is reported in the labeling. The
determined LoB and LoD for the i-STAT Lactate test on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer is shown
below.
Analyte LoB LoD
Lactate 0.15 mmol/L 0.19 mmol/L
Linearity studies were used to support the lower end of the measuring range for pH, PO2 and
PCO2 (see section M.1.b above).
The LoQ of the i-STAT pH, PO2, PCO2, and Lactate tests in the i-STAT CG4+ (blue)
cartridge were evaluated on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer using whole blood that was altered
using tonometry to low pH (< 7 pH units), PO2 (< 15 mmHg), PCO2 (< 15 mmHg), and by
plasma replacement to low lactate (0.22 – 0.29 mmol/L) concentrations. The number of i-
STAT 1 Analyzers used varied; 30 for PO2, 30 for PCO2, 31 for pH and 60 for lactate. The
testing was conducted in replicates of fifteen per sample by five (5) operators for PO2 and
pH, six (6) operators for PCO2, and four (4) operators for lactate using two cartridge lots for
each test over three (3) days. The sponsor defined LoQ as the greater of the two lots at
which the lowest concentration met the pre-defined total error goals given in the following
table.
Analyte Total Error goals
PO ≤ 5.00 mmHg
2
PCO ≤ 5.000 mmHg
2
pH ≤ 0.04000 pH units
Lactate ≤ 0.6000 mmol/L
The LoQ for each of the i-STAT pH, PO2, PCO2, and Lactate tests was determined to be
below the lower limit of the reportable range for each of the i-STAT tests as shown below.
Analyte Reportable range LoQ
