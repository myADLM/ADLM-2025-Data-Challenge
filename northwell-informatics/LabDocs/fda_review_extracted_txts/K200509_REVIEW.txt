B Principle of Operation:
The ADVIA Centaur® Vit D assay is an 18-minute antibody competitive immunoassay that uses
an anti-fluorescein monoclonal mouse antibody covalently bound to paramagnetic particles

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run and total imprecision were evaluated by analyzing six serum samples at the
concentrations below. Each sample was assayed in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for
20 days for a total of 80 replicates per sample. Testing was performed with one reagent lot on
one ADVIA Centaur® XP analyzer. Results are summarized below:
Mean Repeatability Within-Lab
Sample
(ng/mL) SD % CV SD % CV
Serum 1 21.29 1.36 6.4 2.04 9.6
Serum 2 26.10 1.56 6.0 2.37 9.1
Serum 3 32.16 1.71 5.3 2.38 7.4
Serum 4 65.47 2.52 3.8 3.60 5.5
Serum 5 84.12 1.90 2.3 3.34 4.0
Serum 6 132.32 3.13 2.4 4.76 3.6
2. Linearity:
This study was conducted following the guidelines of CLSI EP06-A: Evaluation of the
Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures.
A high (>150 ng/mL) Vitamin D sample was made by spiking 25(OH) Vitamin D into a
human serum sample. Vitamin D stripped human serum was used as the low sample. A
dilution series was then made by mixing the high and low samples to encompass the
measuring interval of the Vitamin D assay. Each resulting sample was run in triplicate on one
reagent lot on one ADVIA Centaur® XP analyzer.
The sponsor concluded that the modified assay is linear from 2.78 ng/mL to 151.00 ng/mL
on the ADVIA Centaur® XP analyzer. A measuring range from 4.2 – 150 ng/mL is claimed
in the labeling.
Dilution Recovery:
To validate the labeling instructions that patient samples with Vitamin D levels above the
claimed measuring range can be manually or automatically diluted 1:2, 5 unique serum
samples were spiked with 25(OH) Vitamin D to produce concentrations ranging from 186 -
211 ng/mL. The samples were then diluted 1:2 with ADVIA Centaur® VitD diluent and
assayed for recovery. The recoveries ranged from 97% to 109%.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Assay specificity was established during the review of k133156.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The ADVIA Centaur® VitD assay measures 25(OH) vitamin D from concentrations of
4.2 to 150 ng/mL (10.5 to 375 nmol/L). The claimed measuring range is defined by the limit
of quantitation (LoQ), linearity, and method comparison studies.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The ADVIA Centaur® VitD calibrators are traceable to the NIST SRM972a 25-OH Vitamin
D reference material.
6. Detection Limit:
A limit of blank (LoB) study was conducted following the guidelines of CLSI EP17-A2:
Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures. Four
blank samples with no Vitamin D were run n=6 for 6 days, 2 runs/day on 2 reagent lots for a
total n=72 reps per sample per lot, on one ADVIA Centaur® XP analyzer. The LoB was
calculated as 1.52 ng/mL.
A limit of detection (LoD) study was conducted following the guidelines of CLSI EP17-A2.
Four (4) low level samples were made by diluting individual patient samples with Vitamin D
stripped serum to concentrations around the expected LoD. Samples were run n=6 for 5 days,
2 runs per day on 2 reagent lots on one ADVIA Centaur® XP analyzer for a total n=60
replicates per sample, and lot. The LoD was calculated as 3.11 ng/mL.
A limit of quantitation (LoQ) study was conducted following the guidelines of CLSI EP17-
A2. Thirteen (13) unique native serum specimens were diluted with Vitamin D stripped
serum to produce concentrations ranging from 1.24 to 25.6 ng/mL, Samples were run n=6
for 5 days, 2 runs per day on two reagent lots, on one ADVIA Centaur® XP analyzer for a
total n=60 replicates per sample, lot, platform, across 5 days. Data was analyzed 2 point
using a stored calibration. LoQ was calculated by precision profile and was defined as the
concentration at which the within-lab coefficient of variation was 20%. The LoQ was
calculated as 4.24 ng/mL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
To compare results from the modified device to the predicate, one hundred twenty-six (126)
serum samples (including 118 native and 8 contrived) were run in singlicate over 2 days
using two lots of modified reagent and compared to the predicate assay on one ADVIA
Centaur® XP analyzer. Contrived samples were made by spiking 25(OH) Vitamin D into
individual samples to obtain Vitamin D levels at the high end of the Vitamin D assay
measuring range. Results using Deming regression are summarized below:
Reagent Lot (y) Reagent Lot 1 Reagent Lot 2
N 126 126

Intercept 0.85 1.74
Slope 1.03 1.04
R Value 0.99 0.99
2. Matrix Comparison:
To validate use of the ADVIA Centaur® VitD assay with different claimed sample types, the
sponsor evaluated 66 native and 8 contrived matched sample sets (serum, serum separator
tube, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, K2 EDTA, K3 EDTA) ranging in concentration from
13.0 to 142.9 ng/mL. Samples were run along with calibrators and control on one ADVIA
Centaur® XP analyzer with one lot of reagent. All samples were tested in replicates of 3 and
the first replicate was used to perform a Weighted-Deming fit regression analysis comparing
all tube types to serum collected in a plain tube without a serum separator. Pearson
correlation coefficient (R) was calculated and the results are summarized below:
Tube Type Slope Intercept R
