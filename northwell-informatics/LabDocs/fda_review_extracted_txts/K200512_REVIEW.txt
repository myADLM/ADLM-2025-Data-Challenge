IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ETEST gradient technology is based on a combination of the concepts of dilution and
diffusion principles for susceptibility testing.
The ETEST consists of a thin, inert, nonporous plastic strip that is used to determine the
antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria. One side of the strip has the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) reading scale expressed in μg/mL. The other side of the strip contains a
predefined continuous exponential gradient of antibiotic concentrations.
When the strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacterial growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip appears.
The MIC value is read from the scale in terms of μg/mL at complete inhibition of bacterial
growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip.
ETEST Plazomicin contains a range of plazomicin from 0.006 to 256 μg/mL.
B Principle of Operation:
When the ETEST strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacteria growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip appears.
After incubation, the MIC value is read from the scale in terms of μg/mL at complete inhibition
of bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip. Since ETEST
generates MIC values which fall between two-fold dilutions for interpretation, the MIC value
read must be recorded to the next two-fold dilution.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was conducted at three sites over three days using a ten-organism
panel that included the following isolates: 1 C. freundii, 1 E. cloacae, 1 E. coli, 1 K.
aerogenes, 3 K. pneumoniae, 1 P. mirabilis, 1 P. stuartii and 1 S. marcescens. The mode of
MIC values was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was calculated based on
the number of MIC values that fell within ±1 doubling dilution of the mode.
The overall reproducibility results were acceptable at 100%.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Not applicable
4. Assay Reportable Range:

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Inoculum Density Check. Inoculum density checks were performed for all quality control
organism suspensions and for 10% of the suspensions prepared for susceptibility testing of
the contemporary clinical isolates. Inoculum density checks were also performed on
reproducibility organism suspensions.
The overall mean inoculum densities in colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) for
isolates tested with the reference method ranged from 2.96 x 105 to 5.43 x 105 CFU/mL. The
overall mean inoculum densities for isolates tested with the ETEST ranged from 5.29 x 107 to
2.31 x 108 CFU/mL.
The inoculum densities were acceptable.
Purity Check. Verification of isolate purity was conducted on all clinical, challenge and
quality control organism suspensions for each ETEST inoculum and from each growth
control well of the broth microdilution (BMD) reference panel.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Results obtained with ETEST Plazomicin were compared to results obtained with the CLSI
broth microdilution (BMD) reference panel. The reference panel, prepared and interpreted
according to recommendations outlined in the CLSI M07 11th ed., contained two-fold serial
dilutions of plazomicin with a concentration range of 0.016 – 256 μg/mL. At the end of
incubation, the MIC value obtained from the ETEST (where the complete inhibition of
growth intersects the strip) was compared to MIC results obtained with the reference method.
The testing conditions for ETEST consisted of the following:
• Inoculum: Direct colony suspension to achieve a suspension equivalent to a 0.5
McFarland standard suspension
• Medium: Cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth or agar
• Incubation: 35° C ± 2 for 16-20 hours

Results

--- Page 7 ---
Clinical testing for ETEST Plazomicin was evaluated at three external sites (two located
within the United States and one located outside the United States). Each clinical isolate was
tested one time by ETEST and BMD using the same initial standardized inoculum prepared
in 0.85% saline. A total of 518 clinical isolates were tested which included 53 C. freundii, 31
C. koseri, 32 K. aerogenes, 50 E. cloacae, 65 E. coli, 32 K. oxytoca, 72 K. pneumoniae, 28
M. morganii, 59 P. mirabilis, 33 P. stuartii, 29 P. vulgaris, and 34 S. marcescens isolates. Of
the tested clinical isolates, 55.2% (286/518) were considered contemporary (i.e., tested
within six months of the organism’s original isolation from clinical specimen) and 44.8%
(232/518) were considered stock (i.e., no time limit from isolation prior to testing).
Challenge testing was performed at one internal site using ETEST and BMD. A total of 80
challenge isolates were tested which included 6 C. freundii, 3 C. koseri, 6 K. aerogenes, 10
E. cloacae, 13 E. coli, 7 K. oxytoca, 17 K. pneumoniae, 3 M. morganii, 4 P. mirabilis, 2 P.
stuartii, 5 P. vulgaris, and 4 S. marcescens isolates.
In total, the comparative study included 598 clinical and challenge isolates.

R – Resistant isolates
Essential Agreement (EA) is when the ETEST result agrees exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference
broth microdilution result. Category Agreement (CA) is when the ETEST result interpretation agrees exactly with the
reference broth microdilution result interpretation.
ETEST Plazomicin performance for all Enterobacteriaceae isolates (clinical and challenge)
is acceptable with 99.0% EA and 92.8% CA. There were zero major errors and one very
major error (1/53 = 1.9%) which is acceptable.
When the performance was evaluated individually by species, it was noted that the CA for M.
morganii, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. stuartii and S. marcescens was less than 90% for each
organism (CA ranged from 67.5% - 89.5%). However, performance is considered acceptable
since the EA for each organism was above 90% and all categorical errors were minor with
MIC values within one doubling dilution of the reference MIC value (i.e. in essential
agreement), except for one isolate of S. marcescens. The following statement is included as a
footnote to the performance table in the device labeling:

The Category Agreement was < 90% for the following organisms: Morganella morganii
(67.7%), Proteus mirabilis (85.7%), Providencia stuartii (74.3%), Proteus vulgaris
(85.3%) and Serratia marcescens (89.5%). The performance is acceptable since the
Essential Agreement was >90% and all categorical errors were minor and within
essential agreement, except for one isolate of Serratia marcescens.
There were no resistant isolates of C. koseri tested in the comparative study. One resistant
isolate of S. marcescens was tested; however, ETEST failed to provide a resistant result
which generated a very major error (1/1 = 100% VMJ). This error was considered a random
error.
To address the lack or insufficient testing of resistant isolates, the following statement is
included as a limitation in the device labeling:
The ability of ETEST Plazomicin to detect the following resistant isolates is unknown
because a sufficient number of resistant isolates were not available at the time of
comparative testing: Citrobacter koseri, Serratia marcescens.
As required under 511A(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the
following statement is included in the Warnings and Precautions section of the device
labeling to address the testing and reporting of non-indicated species:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.
Inoculator and ETEST Strip Applicator Options
Culture media plates for ETEST can be inoculated and streaked by swabs manually or with
the RETRO C80 inoculator. ETEST strips can be applied onto inoculated media using
forceps or the NEMA C88 vacuum pen.
The ETEST Plazomicin studies used both inoculation and strip application methods. The
following statement is included as a footnote to the performance table in the device labeling:
The optional inoculator and ETEST strip applicator can be used for plate inoculation
and applying ETEST strips onto agar media. In the ETEST Plazomicin clinical studies,
swabs and the Inoculator RETRO C80 were used for plate inoculation/streaking and
forceps and the Vacuum Pen NEMA C88 were used for ETEST strip application.
Trending
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) for each
organism species and Enterobacteriaceae as a group. This trending calculation analyzes
K200512 - Page 8 of 11

--- Page 9 ---
device MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher
than the reference method. MIC values that are off-scale for both the reference and device are
not considered in the trending analysis.
Trending results were stratified by species to determine if species-related trends were
observed (Table 3). Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with
higher versus lower MIC values was ≥30% and for which the confidence interval was
determined to be statistically significant were considered to have evidence of trending and is
addressed in labeling.

ETEST Plazomicin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one doubling
dilution lower when testing Morganella morganii compared to the CLSI reference broth
microdilution method.
Resistance Markers
Molecular characterization for resistance to plazomicin, as indicated on the plazomicin drug
label, was identified for challenge isolates by whole genome sequencing analysis. They
consisted of genetic markers that confer resistance to aminoglycosides, including 16S rRNA
methyltransferases and aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs). Other mechanisms of
plazomicin resistance, such as altered efflux and loss of outer membrane porins, were not
evaluated.

IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux

limitations as determined by their evaluation.
