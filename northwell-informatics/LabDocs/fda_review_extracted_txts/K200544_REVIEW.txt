III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The SmartLyte® Plus is an automated, microprocessor-controlled analyzer which utilizes ion-
selective electrodes for the measurement of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium and lithium in
Serum, Sodium Heparin Plasma, and Venous Whole Blood, as well as measurement of sodium,
potassium and chloride in pre-diluted Urine samples.
The SmartLyte® Plus Sodium Assay is intended to measure sodium in whole blood, serum,
plasma, and urine on the SmartLyte® Plus Electrolyte Analyzer. Measurements obtained by this
device are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism
(excessive secretion of the hormone aldosterone), diabetes insipidus (chronic excretion of large
amounts of dilute urine, accompanied by extreme thirst), adrenal hypertension, Addison's disease
(caused by destruction of the adrenal glands), dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone
secretion, or other diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.
The SmartLyte® Plus Potassium Assay is intended to measure potassium in whole blood, serum,
plasma, and urine on the SmartLyte® Plus Electrolyte Analyzer. Measurements obtained by this
device are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases
conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium levels.
The SmartLyte® Plus Chloride Assay is intended to measure the level of chloride in whole
blood, serum, plasma, and urine on the SmartLyte® Plus Electrolyte Analyzer. Chloride
measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic disorders such
as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.
The SmartLyte® Plus Calcium Assay is intended to measure ionized calcium levels in whole

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The SmartLyte® Plus Electrolyte Analyzer Na+/K+/Cl-/Ca++/Li+ is an automated, microprocessor-
controlled analyzer which utilizes ion-selective electrodes for the measurement of sodium,
potassium, chloride, ionized calcium and lithium in serum, sodium heparin plasma and venous
whole blood, as well as measurement of sodium, potassium and chloride in prediluted urine
samples. The analyzer self-calibrates using Diamond Diagnostics Fluid Pack (k013850) every 4
hours throughout the day or on request.
B Principle of Operation:
The SmartLyte® Plus Electrolyte Analyzer Na+/K+/Cl-/Ca++/Li+ measures sodium, potassium and
chloride in whole blood, serum, plasma, and urine and ionized calcium and lithium in whole
blood, serum, and plasma, using ion selective electrode technology. The flow-through sodium
electrode contains a glass tube, specially formulated to be sensitive to sodium ions. The flow-
through potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, and lithium electrodes incorporate a neutral carrier
ionophore membrane. The potential of each electrode is measured relative to a fixed, stable
voltage established by the silver/silver chloride reference electrode. An ion selective electrode
develops a voltage that varies with the concentration of the ion to which it responds. The
relationship between the voltage developed and the concentration of the sensed ion is
logarithmic.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
SmartLyte® Plus Electrolyte Analyzer Na+/K+/Cl-/Ca++/Li+
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen (sample type and patient) should be identified by manually entering the
information via the touchscreen.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Sodium heparin venous whole blood from syringe, evacuated collection tubes or cup can be
aspirated by positioning the sample over a probe for all analytes.
4. Calibration:
The SmartLyte® Plus analyzer performs a 2-point calibration (3-point calibration if lithium)
every 4 hours. The software also permits calibration on demand. A 1-point calibration is
performed automatically with each measurement.
5. Quality Control:
Diamond Diagnostics controls (k033063) are the recommended quality control material to be
used daily.

Total precision
Total precision was evaluated using three sodium heparin venous whole blood, serum,
sodium heparin plasma, urine, and control samples for each analyte. Samples concentrations
spanned the measuring range. Samples were measured twice a day in duplicate for ten
consecutive days resulting in n=40 replicates per sample using multiple reagents lots.
Venous whole blood samples were tested over 2-hour time period since the analytes
measured are not stable in sodium heparin venous whole blood for long periods of times.
The results are summarized below.

Linearity was evaluated by preparing stock solutions with high concentrations of Na, K, Cl in
sodium heparin venous whole blood, serum, sodium heparin plasma, and urine. Linearity for
Li and Ca was assessed in pooled sodium heparin venous whole blood, serum, sodium
heparin plasma. Linear regression was performed.

6. Detection Limit:
Reportable ranges were determined based on the linearity studies for Na+, K+, and Cl- (see
Section VII.A.2 above).
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
determined for ionized calcium and lithium according to CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
For LoB studies, blank samples were tested on one analyzer with two different reagent lots.
Five different blank samples were run in replicates of five on each day for three days for a
total of 75 replicates per lot. The LoB was calculated using the non-parametric method.
For LoD studies, samples with low levels of ionized calcium or lithium were prepared and
run five times on one analyzer with two different reagent lots. Five different low-level
samples were tested in replicates of five on each day for three days for a total of 75 replicates
per lot. The results were pooled to calculate the total standard deviation (SDL) per lot. The
LoD was calculated using the equation: LoD = LoB + CpSDL. The maximum value of the
LoDs obtained for the two lots was reported as the LoD of the device.
For LoQ studies, five pooled samples with low levels of ionized calcium or lithium were
prepared and measured in replicates of five on each day for three days using two diferent
reagent lots on one ananlyzer giving a total of 75 replicates per lot. The mean, SD, and bias
relative to a reference value was calculated for each sample. These values were used to
calculate TE using the equation TE = |Bias| + 2s for each sample and expressed as
concentrations relative to the respective reference value for each sample. The LoQ was
defined as a Total Error (TE) of 21.6%.
The overall results of LoB, LoD, and LoQ for each matrix are summarized below:
Sodium heparin venous whole blood

Ca2+ (mmol/L) 0.043 0.094 0.295

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were conducted to demonstrate the correlation of Diamond
Diagnostics SmartLyte® Plus Analyzer to the predicate device (GemLyte Electrolyte
Analyzer) operated by trained personnel. Contrived samples were less than 10% of all
samples tested and were limited to the extreme ends of claimed assay ranges. Slope,
intercept, and R2 were calculated from a linear regression analysis. Results are summarized
below.
