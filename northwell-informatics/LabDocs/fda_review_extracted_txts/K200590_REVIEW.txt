D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using VITEK 2 Systems 9.04 software or later
versions
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically dilute the bacterial suspension to prepare an inoculum for
susceptibility cards. Then the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and place the card into the incubator/reader.
The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2
Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. The analysis
program determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured by
an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration or
“MIC” values for the anti-microbial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is
generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each
antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GP Delafloxacin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.008, 0.03, 0.06,
and 0.25 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The
delafloxacin MIC result range for the VITEK 2 is ≤0.015 – ≥1 μg/mL. For all species, the
VITEK 2 system is capable of reporting the following MIC results: ≤0.015, 0.03, 0.06, 0.125,
0.25, 0.5 and ≥1 μg/mL for the AST-GP Dalbavancin test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-GP card with Delafloxacin was conducted at
three clinical sites using a panel of ten Gram-positive microorganisms consistent with the
indications for use and included five Enterococcus faecalis and five Staphylococcus aureus
isolates. Each isolate was tested in triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points.
Inocula were prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing
in the VITEK 2 System. In addition, inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method
for use with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode of MIC values was determined for each
isolate and the reproducibility was calculated based on the number of MIC values that fell
within ±1 doubling dilution of the mode MIC value. The data was analyzed taking into
consideration best-case and worst-case scenarios as described in the Class II Special Controls
Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.
All MIC values were on-scale and within one doubling dilution of the mode MIC. The testing
resulted in overall reproducibility of 100% for each dilution method and instrument, which is
acceptable.

The VITEK 2 AST-GP Delafloxacin reporting range (≤0.015 to ≥1 μg/mL) does not include
the CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution range for QC testing of S. aureus ATCC 29213
(0.001-0.008 µg/mL). As such, an in-range VITEK result will be ≤ the lowest dilution on the

result range within the Quality Control table in the device labeling:
Does not include the CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution range for QC testing with this
organism.
Acceptance of QC results for the VITEK 2 AST-GP Delafloxacin was based on the
Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 strain since it provided results confirming the range.
Both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods for VITEK 2 and the manual dilution
for VITEK 2 Compact QC results were within the expected range >95% of the time, which is
acceptable.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Testing of delafloxacin on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive card was performed at four
clinical sites. There were 676 clinical isolates and 87 challenge isolates tested for a total of
763 isolates. Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive card with delafloxacin
were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution (BMD) reference
panel. The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Delafloxacin is ≤0.015 to
≥1 μg/mL for all species. The reference panel contained two-fold serial dilutions of
delafloxacin with a range of ≤0.002 to ≥4 μg/mL. The testing conditions for the reference
method consisted of the following:
• Medium – Cation Adjusted Mueller Hinton broth
• Inoculum – Direct colony suspension
• Incubation – 35°C; 16-20 hours for Staphylococci and Enterococci
35°C; 20-24 hours for Streptococci
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test inocula
K200590 - Page 7 of 13

used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using the
DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 676 clinical isolates were evaluated at three sites: 43.2% were considered
contemporary isolates (isolated from clinical specimen and tested within 6 months) and
56.8% were stock isolates. Complete test results are available for all 676 clinical isolates
from indicated species: 317 Enterococcus faecalis, 299 Staphylococcus aureus (136 MRSA
and 163 MSSA), and 60 Streptococcus agalactiae. All clinical isolates were tested with the
auto-dilution option of the VITEK 2.
A total of 87 challenge isolates were evaluated at one site. They included: 43 Enterococcus
faecalis, 27 Staphylococcus aureus (20 MRSA and 7 MSSA), and 17 Streptococcus
agalactiae. The challenge set was tested with the auto-dilution and manual dilution options
of the VITEK 2 and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact.
At the time of comparative testing, a sufficient number of resistant isolates was not available
for Streptococcus agalactiae. The following statement is included in the Limitations section
of the device labeling:
The ability of the AST card to detect resistant strains with the following combination(s) is
unknown because an insufficient number of resistant strains were available at the time of
comparative testing.

The overall performance of Enterococcus faecalis is acceptable with an EA of 100% and a
CA of 100% with both the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems. There were no major or
very major errors. The overall performance of Streptococcus agalactiae is acceptable with an
EA of 94.1% and a CA of 100% with both the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems.
There were no major or very major errors. The overall performance of Staphylococcus
aureus is not acceptable with an EA of 88.9% and a CA of 81.5% with both the VITEK 2
and VITEK 2 Compact systems. There were no major or very major errors.
When S. aureus performance data was stratified by methicillin-resistant and methicillin-
susceptible, performance of MSSA is acceptable with an EA of 100% and an CA of 85.7%.
Since the EA of test results was very good, the <90% CA is acceptable. Meanwhile,
performance of MRSA is unacceptable with an EA of 85.0% and an CA of 80.0% with both
the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems. The following footnote statement is included
in the device labeling to address performance:
When evaluating performance of the challenge isolates on the manual dilution option for
the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact, testing with MRSA isolates yielded an EA of 85%
(17/20) and an CA of 80% (16/20). For challenge isolates on the auto dilution option for
the VITEK 2, testing with MRSA isolates yielded an EA of 85% (17/20) and an CA of
85% (17/20). All categorical errors were considered minor.

The overall performance of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus is acceptable with
an EA of 100% and a CA of 100% with both the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems.
There were no major or very major errors.
To address testing and reporting of non-indicated species, the following statement is included
in the Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.
Resistance Mechanism Characterization
Three challenge isolates (S. aureus and E. faecalis) harboring the following molecular
mechanism of resistance noted in the FDA drug label were tested with delafloxacin:
quinolone resistance determining region (GyrA and ParC).
MIC Trends
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method for each indicated organism species (Table 7). This
trending calculation analyzes device MIC values that are determined to be one or more
doubling dilutions lower or higher than the reference method. MIC values that are off-scale
for both the reference and device are not considered in the trending analysis. Species for
which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher or lower MIC values was
≥30% with a statistically significant confidence interval were considered to have evidence of
trending.

footnote to the performance table is included in the package insert to address the trending
observed for VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Delafloxacin:
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Delafloxacin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement
or at least one doubling dilution higher when testing Staphylococcus aureus compared to
the CLSI reference broth microdilution method.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GP Delafloxacin when revised breakpoints for
delafloxacin are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the
delafloxacin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
