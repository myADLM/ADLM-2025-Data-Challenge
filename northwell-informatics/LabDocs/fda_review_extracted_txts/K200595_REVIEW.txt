C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The CellaVision DC-1 is a cell-locating device. The CellaVision DC-1 consists of a built-in PC
with a Solid-State Disk (SSD) containing CellaVision DM Software (CDMS), a high-power
magnification focusing nosepiece micrscope with a LED illumination, an XY stage, a proprietary
camera with firmware, built-in motor- and illumination LED controller, a casing and an external
power supply.
The CDMS is the software that controls the collection of cell images, stores the images of the
located cells and the results, and displays the images in an organized manner to the operator.
The Peripheral Blood Application (PBA) is a software module included as part of the CDMS.
The PBA performs pre-classification of WBCs, pre-characterization of RBCs, and facilitates
platelet estimation by presenting an overview image captured of a monolayer area.
K200595 - Page 2 of 17

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The typical workflow with respect to the CellaVision DC-1 is as follows.
• From a peripheral blood sample collected in K EDTA or K EDTA tube, typically flagged by
2 3
a cell-counter indicating an abnormal morphology, a thin blood film is wedged on a glass
slide (a blood smear). The blood smear is then stained with Romanowsky stain. The system
uses stained microscope slides made either manually or by using an automatic slide maker-
stainer.
• The operator enters the order ID for the slide, either manually or using an optional barcode
reader. If a Laboratory Information System (LIS) is used, the device automatically fetches
order data for the sample from the LIS.
• The operator places the slide in the loading tray of the device and closes the input hatch. The
device automatically moves the slide under the microscope. Starting at 33 mm from the edge
of the slide, the device looks for a monolayer in the smear. Once a monolayer is found, the
device scans the monolayer in a battlement pattern. While doing this, the device locates any
WBCs and stores high quality images of each located WBC. The device also locates and
stores an overview image of a part of the RBC monolayer.
• The device software, PBA, pre-classifies each located WBC. It also pre-characterizes the
RBC morphology based on the overview image. By using the overview image, the operator
can calculate or estimate the level of PLTs.
• During the review/verification stage, a skilled operator, trained in the use of the software and
in recognition of blood cells, then opens the order to review and verify (or modify) the
preliminary results. The review can be done either at the device or using the CellaVision
Remote Review Software (CRRS).
Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name: CellaVision DC-1
2. Specimen Identification: All slides must be labeled clearly with patient or order information.
To use the optional handheld barcode reader, slides must be labeled with a barcode label.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling: Slides are processed one at a time. To load slide,
manually open the input hatch, place the slide, with the blood smear facing up, in the loading
tray, and close the hatch.
4. Calibration: CellaVision recommends that calibration is performed once a year by a service
engineer.
5. Quality Control:
K200595 - Page 3 of 17

--- Page 4 ---
Self-Test - The CellaVision DC-1 analyzer performs self-tests during startup of the software,
and at certain points during the operation of the analyzer. When the software starts, the
analyzer is checked before the user can start analyzing. During this phase, both the hardware
and the software components are tested for anomalies, as well as various requirements for the
operation of the analyzer.
Cell Location Test - A cell location test shall be run at least once a day and after any changes
in the staining procedure or the staining solutions for quality control. Cell location slides are
prepared and processed by the customer from a freshly stained slide from a blood sample
with a WBC count within the normal range. The cell location test verifies that the quality of
the slide preparation process is good enough to allow the analyzer to locate the cells needed
for the analysis. It also verifies the analyzer’s ability to locate cells.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three repeatability studies were performed for white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell
(RBC), and platelet (PLT), respectively to demonstrate the repeatable performance of
CellaVision DC-1 across multiple days. Three reproducibility studies were also conducted
for WBC, RBC, and PLT to demonstrate that the results generated by the CellaVision DC-1
are reproducible across sites. Each study was conducted at one U.S. site and two sites outside
the U.S. The study designs and representative results are summarized below.
i. WBC Pre-classification Repeatability
The repeatability of WBC pre-classification results generated by CellaVision DC-1 was
evaluated across multiple days. At each site, the study included five samples, one was
normal sample and four displayed various clinical pathological characteristics (i.e.
abnormal samples). The study samples were selected from leftover samples from the
laboratory’s daily workflow. All samples were initially analyzed on an automated cell
counter available at the site. Each sample was made into two slides to represent two
replicates (i.e. both slides were analyzed once in each run to represent two replicate
measurements). Each sample was run twice per day for 20 days, resulting in 20 x 2 x 2
measurements. The proportional cell count in percent for each cell class was used to
estimate total variance and variance components for repeatability, including within-run,
between-run, between-day, and within-laboratory, by an ANOVA. The WBC results were
evaluated separately for each sample and site.
ii. RBC Pre-characterization Repeatability
The repeatability of RBC pre-characterization results generated by CellaVision DC-1 was
evaluated across multiple days. At each site, the study included five samples, one was
normal sample and four displayed abnormal levels of Polychromatic cells,
K200595 - Page 9 of 17

--- Page 10 ---
Hypochromatic cells, Anisocytosis, Microcytes, Macrocytes, Poikilocytosis (i.e.
abnormal samples). The study samples were selected from leftover samples from the
laboratory’s daily workflow. All five samples were initially analyzed on an automated
cell counter available at the site. Each sample was made into two slides to represent two
replicates (i.e. both slides were analyzed once in each run to represent two replicate
measurements). Each sample was run twice per day for 20 days, resulting in 20 x 2 x 2
measurements. The repeatability in terms of grade (0, 1, 2 or 3) for each morphological
characteristic was evaluated. The most prevalent grade reported was evaluated, and the
agreement (percentage of runs reporting the grade) was calculated for each morphology.
The agreement was evaluated for each slide and run, as well as for each sample. The
RBC results were evaluated separately for each site.
iii. PLT Estimation Repeatability
The repeatability of PLT estimation using the overview image captured by the
CellaVision DC-1 was evaluated across multiple days. The procedure for estimating PLT
concentration with the overview image provided by CellaVision DC-1 includes: 1) First,
the overview image is divided into multiple grids and the operator counts the number of
platelet in each grid and enters the counted values for all corresponding grids to estimate
the concentration of PLT in the sample; 2) Based on the estimated concentration of PLT,
the device reports a grade (1 = significant decreased, 2 = decreased, 3 = normal, and 4 =
increased) corresponding to the predefined ranges. At each site, the study included four
samples, one was normal sample (~250 x 109/L) and three abnormal samples, including
one significantly decreased (~30 x 109/L), one decreased (~100x109/L), and one
increased (~600 x 109/L) samples. The study samples were selected from leftover
samples from the laboratory’s daily workflow. All four samples were initially analyzed
on an automated cell counter available at the site. Each sample was made into two slides
to represent two replicates (i.e. both slides were analyzed once in each run to represent
two replicate measurements). Each sample was run twice per day for 20 days, resulting in
20 x 2 x 2 measurements. The agreement (i.e. percentage of runs reporting the actual PLT
level) was evaluated for each PLT level. The PLT results were evaluated separately for
each site.
iv. WBC Reproducibility
A three-site reproducibility study was conducted to demonstrate that the WBC results
obtained from using the CellaVision DC-1 were reproducible across multiple sites
(devices). The study included five samples, one was normal sample and four displayed
various clinical pathological characteristics (i.e. abnormal samples). The study samples
were selected from leftover samples from the laboratories’ daily workflow. All five
samples were initially analyzed on an automated cell counter. Each sample was made into
five slides to represent five replicates (i.e. five slides were analyzed once in each run to
represent five replicate measurements) that were run once per day for five days per site,
resulting in 3 x 5 x 5 measurements in total. In the primary analysis, the operator-verified
results, including the proportional cell count in percent for each cell class, were used to
estimate total variation and variance. In addition to analyzing the operator-verified
K200595 - Page 10 of 17

--- Page 11 ---
results, a secondary analysis was performed on the preclassification outputs generated by
the CellaVision DC-1 (i.e. without operator verification).
v. RBC Reproducibility
A three-site reproducibility study was conducted to demonstrate that the RBC results
obtained from using the CellaVision DC-1 were reproducible. The study included four
samples, one was normal sample and three displayed abnormal levels of Polychromatic
cells, Hypochromatic cells, Anisocytosis, Microcytes, Macrocytes, Poikilocytosis (i.e.
abnormal samples). The study samples were selected from leftover samples from the
laboratory’s daily workflow. All four samples were initially analyzed on an automated
cell counter available at the site. Each sample was made into five slides to represent five
replicates (i.e. five slides were analyzed once in each run to represent five replicate
measurements). The slides were run once per day for five days per site, resulting in 3 x 5
x 5 measurements in total. Reproducibility in terms of grade (0, 1, 2 or 3) for each
morphological characteristic was evaluated. The most prevalent grade reported was
evaluated, and the agreement (percentage of runs reporting the grade) was calculated.
vi. PLT Reproducibility
A three-site reproducibility study was conducted to demonstrate that the PLT results
obtained from using the overview image provided by CellaVision DC-1 were
reproducible. The study included four samples, one was normal sample (~250x109/L) and
three abnormal samples, including one significantly decreased (~30x109/L), one
decreased (~100x109/L), and one increased (~600x109/L) samples. The study samples
were leftover samples selected from different laboratories’ daily workflow. All four
samples were initially analyzed on an automated cell counter. Each sample was made into
five slides to represent five replicates (i.e. five slides were analyzed once in each run to
represent five replicate measurements) that were run once per day for five days per site,
resulting in 3 x 5 x 5 measurements in total. For each PLT level (significantly decreased,
decreased, normal or increased) the agreement (i.e. percentage of runs reporting the
actual PLT level) was evaluated. The agreement was evaluated for each sample and site
and representative results by sample are presented below.

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Three multi-site method comparison studies were conducted for WBC, RBC, and PLT,
respectively to demonstrate that the CellaVision DC-1 (DC-1) performs equivalently to the
predicate device, CellaVision DM1200 (DM1200). Each study involved three sites, one of
which was a U.S. site. A total of seven sites participated in the three studies.
i. WBC Comparison
A total of 598 samples were analyzed on both the DM1200 and on the DC-1. The
samples were leftover samples from the laboratory´s daily workload. Each site collected
approximately 200 samples, 100 of which were normal (non-diseased) and 100 were
samples with various clinical pathological characteristics (abnormal samples). Normal
and abnormal samples were defined in accordance with CLSI H20-A2. The samples
covered a wide range of ages and both genders. Three slides (A, B, and Spare) were
prepared from each sample and stained using Romanowsky stain as per standard clinical
practice. The operator-verified WBC results from the DC-1 were compared to the
K200595 - Page 12 of 17

corresponding results from the DM1200. The results of one slide (slide A) from the DC-1
were compared to the mean results (slide A and slide B) from the DM1200, also known
as the single slide evaluation.
WBC Evaluation
In this evaluation, the results from one slide per sample (slide A) from the DC-1 were
compared to the mean results (slides A and B) from the DM1200. This evaluation was
referred to as the duplicate slide evaluation.

A total of 586 slides (one slide per sample) were analyzed on both the DC-1 and the
DM1200 across three sites. The samples were leftover samples from the laboratory´s
daily workload. Each site collected approximately 200 samples, with 50 samples for each
group: normal, color (Polychromasia, Hypochromasia), size (Anisocytosis, Microcytosis,
Macrocytosis) and shape (Poikilocytosis). The samples covered a wide range of ages and
both genders. The slides were divided into four sets, one for each operator (e.g. 50 slides
in each). Each of the operators verified their own allocated slides on both the DM1200
and the DC-1.
The RBCs were characterized for each morphology according to a predefined 4-graded
scale (normal (0), slight (1), moderate (2) or marked (3)). The operator-verified RBC
results from the DC-1 were compared to the corresponding results from the DM1200.
PPA, NPA and OA with two-sided 95% confidence intervals, comparing the DC-1 results
with the DM1200 results, were calculated. The results were assumed to be normally
distributed and calculations of 95% confidence intervals were performed as described in
CLSI EP12-A2. The overall agreement results for each group are presented below.

RBC Supplemental Study: DC-1 versus manual light microscope
To supplement the results for the Color group, the sponsor conducted a study in which
results for the group Color from the DC-1 were compared to the results from manual light
microscope. An experienced operator analyzed 70 slides made up of normal and
abnormal (polychromatic and hypochromatic) samples on both the DC-1 and the manual
light microscope with a wash-out period between the two devices. The results are
summarized below.
