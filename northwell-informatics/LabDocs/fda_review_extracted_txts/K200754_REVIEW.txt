IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 is an automated fecal occult blood test system for the
qualitative detection of fecal occult blood. It is intended for professional use only. The test
system consists of a test cartridge, a sample collection tube, an analyzer, controls and calibration
cartridges. The Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 system is a sandwich immunoassay that
employs a combination of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to selectively identify human
hemoglobin (hHb) in test samples. It consists of:
Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 Reader with Sample Tray
It is an automated camera-based analyzer. Digital imaging is used to analyze the intensity of the
test and control lines resulting from the introduction of the sample to the sandwich dye–
conjugate immunoassay. The results (positive, negative, or invalid) are reported on a display
screen and as a printout.
The sample tray comprises of a turntable and a turntable motor with a mechanism that positions
and controls the sample diluent on the test strip.
Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 Test Cartridge Kit
The Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 adopts a patented test cartridge system which is comprised
of:
Test Cartridge: It is a polystyrene plastic case that contains a test strip composed of a
plastic plate, a water absorption plate, a nitrocellulose film, colloidal gold, and water
absorption paper. The nitrocellulose membrane consists of a control line (line C) coated
with sheep anti-mouse polyclonal antibody and a reaction line (line T) coated with mouse
anti-human hemoglobin monoclonal antibody. The test strip and cartridge are assembled and
designed to prevent any ingress of liquid or air that affects the performance of the test strip
and, when the sample buffer collection tube with the fecal material is inserted, prevents any
spill outside the test cartridge, creating a clean-free system for the Hemosure Accu-Reader
A100.
K200754 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
Sample Collection tube: It contains phosphate-buffered saline. The sample collected by the
patient is inserted into the test cartridge (molded for correct insertion) and is placed into the
reader sample tray.
Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 Control
The Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 Control has two control solutions, positive control solution
and negative control solution.
Positive control solutions are supplied as 2 mL or 5 mL, containing purified human hemoglobin,
Tris buffer, bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% sodium azide. It is stored at 2–8°C.
Negative control solutions are supplied as 2 mL or 5 mL, containing Tris buffer, bovine serum
albumin, and 0.05% sodium azide. It is stored at 2–8°C.
Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 Calibration Cartridge Kit
The Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 is supplied with a Calibration Cartridge Kit to check the assay
reading performance.
B Principle of Operation:
The assay principle is based on an automated sandwich dye–conjugate immunoassay that
employs a combination of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to selectively identify and
provide qualitative determination of human hemoglobin (hHb) in feces. As the test sample flows
through the absorbent device, the labeled antibody-dye conjugate binds to the hemoglobin in the
specimen forming an antibody-antigen complex. This complex binds to another anti-hemoglobin
antibody in the positive test reaction zone and produces a pink-rose color band. In the absence of
hemoglobin, there is no line in the positive test reaction zone. The pink-rose color bands in the
control reaction zone demonstrate that the reagents and devices are functioning correctly.
The Hemosure Accu-Reader™ A100 Reader with Sample Tray is an automated camera-based
analyzer. Digital imaging is used to analyze the intensity of the test and control lines resulting
from the introduction of the sample to the sandwich dye-conjugate immunoassay.
The samples are collected in the Sample Collection tube that is sent home with the patient. On
return, the sample tube and test cartridge are assembled and placed on the sample tray. The
analyzer positions the test cartridge to the plunger station to initiate the test cartridge testing by
plunging the sample collection buffer tube into the chamber of the cartridge and thereby piercing
its aluminum seal. The test fecal sample buffer is released into the test cartridge and fecal sample
buffer will migrate on the enclosed test strip affixed on the test cartridge. Results are read after
the tray makes one full rotation which takes 5 minutes. Immediately after sample reading, the
result (positive, negative, or invalid) is displayed on the touchscreen and printed on paper whose
dispensing slot is situated at the top of the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Hemosure® Accu-Reader™ A100 Reader with Sample Tray
2. Specimen Identification:
The feces samples are collected into the Sample Collection tube, each of which includes a
barcode. If patient sample ID barcodes are not available, patient sample information must be

4. Calibration:
The Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 is supplied with a Hemosure Accu-Reader A100
Calibration Cartridge Kit to check the analyzer performance. The kit includes a set of 10
calibration cartridges. It is recommended that Accu-Reader A100 calibration procedure must
be conducted every 90 days. The calibration checks if the internal digital camera is
functioning correctly, the lens is free from debris, and the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 is
working as per the specification.
5. Quality Control:
Internal control: The test strip within the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test Cartridge
contains internal control lines to determine whether or not the test has run properly.
External control: Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Control is used in an external control
procedure. The control solutions should be run each day before testing patient samples.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were designed in accordance with CLSI EP12-A2. The repeatability study
was performed at a single site using a single lot of test cartridge on a single instrument by an
operator. 21 replicates for each of seven contrived human hemoglobin (hHb) samples were
tested. Samples were prepared in the Sample Collection tubes by spiking hHb into Hb-free
stool giving the following concentrations: 0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and 1000 ngHb/mL.
Between-lot (one instrument, one operator and three lots of the test cartridge), between-
instrument (three instruments, one operator and one lot of the test cartridge) and between-run
(one instrument, three operators and three lots of the test cartridge) variabilities were also
evaluated for the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100. All results met the pre-defined acceptance
criteria.
The multi-site reproducibility study was conducted at four sites utilizing four instruments,
one instrument per site, with four lots of test cartridge and each site tested one lot. One
operator at each site performed the study. Seven contrived human hemoglobin samples were
prepared in the Sample Collection tubes by spiking human Hb into Hb-free stool giving
samples concentrations of 0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and 1000 ng Hb/mL. Testing included 21
replicates for each concentration level. All results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a) Human Hemoglobin Variant
The ability of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 to detect abnormal human hemoglobin
variants was determined by testing a series of concentrations of Hemoglobin-S (HbS)
spiked into human fecal samples. 21 replicates of fecal samples spiked with Hb-S for
each concentration were prepared and tested using one lot of test cartridge. The
concentrations tested include: 0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and 1000 ng HbS/mL. At the
concentration of 140 ng/mL, the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 was consistently positive.
The study results suggest that Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 is equally sensitive to detect
HbS as to human hemoglobin (hHb).
b) Cross Reactivity
i. Animal Hemoglobin
The cross-reactivity of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with non-human hemoglobin
was evaluated by using one lot of test cartridge. Human hemoglobin (hHb) fecal
samples at different concentrations (0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and 1000 ng/mL) were
spiked with 500 µg/mL hemoglobin from bovine, porcine, fish, equine, goat, rabbit
and sheep. All samples were tested in 21 replicates. The results demonstrate no
cross-reactivity of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with any of the tested animal
hemoglobins.
ii. Dietary Substance and Vegetable Extracts
The cross-reactivity of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with dietary substances and
vegetable extracts were evaluated by using one lot of test cartridge. Hemoglobin free
stool samples were spiked with hHb to obtain seven concentrations (0, 80, 100, 110,

120, 140, and 1000 ng/mL). Samples at different concentration were then spiked
with each of the following: 0.5% (by weight) iron, 0.5% (by weight) vitamin C
(sodium L-ascorbate), 2.5% (by weight) of broccoli extracts, 2.5% (by weight)
cantaloupe extracts, 2.5% (by weight) horseradish extracts, 2.5% (by weight) red
radish extracts, 2.5% (by weight) parsnip extracts, 2.5% (by weight) turnip extracts
and 2.5% (by weight) cauliflower extracts. All samples were tested in 21 replicates.
The results demonstrate no cross-reactivity of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with
the dietary substances and vegetable extracts at the tested concentrations.
c) Interference
Interference of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with animal meat extracts, toilet cleaners
and contaminants were evaluated using one lot of test cartridge. Hemoglobin free stool
samples were spiked with normal Hb to obtain seven concentrations: 0, 80, 100, 110,
120, 140, and 1000 ng/mL. Samples at each concentration were then spiked with the
following animal meat extracts: 2.5% of beef, 2.5% of pork, 2.5% of fish, 2.5% of
chicken, 2.5% of lamb, 2.5% of horse, 2.5% of goat and 2.5% of rabbit. The results
demonstrate no interference of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with animal meat extracts
at the tested concentration.
For testing interference with toilet cleaners and other contaminants, Lime-A-Way (5
mg/mL), Clorox (5 mg/mL), Lysol bleach (5 mg/mL), Lysol cleaner (5 mg/mL),
Scrubbing Bubbles (5 mg/mL), Bisacodyl enteric coated tablets (25 mg/mL), Sennoside
tablets (25 mg/mL), glycerol enema (25 mg/mL), and hydrogen peroxide enema (25
mg/mL) were tested. All samples were tested in 21 replicates. The results demonstrate no
interference of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 with the interferents at the tested
concentration.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed to demonstrate the equivalency between
Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 and the OC Auto Micro FOB Test on the OC Auto Micro 80
Analyzer. A total of 377 clinical fecal samples were tested from individuals that had recently
been screened by colonoscopy. The patient population included high risk individuals
(subjects with positive diagnoses i.e., diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease,
rectal adenomas/adenomatous polyps, Gardner syndrome, colorectal cancer, etc.) and
asymptomatic individuals (subjects with negative diagnoses i.e., individuals without any of
the above clinical conditions). The study was performed at three external sites, each site with

Prozone Effect (Hook-Effect)
The prozone study was conducted to determine the effects of high concentrations of human
hemoglobin on the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 test results. Hemoglobin-free stool sample was
spiked with human blood of known hemoglobin concentration to achieve following
concentrations: 500, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500, 2000, 2500 and 3000 ng/mL. A total of 21 replicates
were tested at each hemoglobin concentration with one lot of the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100
Test Cartridge Kit. The Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 was not susceptible to the Hook effect up
to a concentration of 3000 ng/mL.
Sample Stability Studies
Stool samples were spiked with different concentrations of human hemoglobin and stored in the
Sample Collection tubes at different temperatures for up to 30 days after sampling using three
lots of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test Cartridge Kits (including the Test Cartridge and the
Sample Collection tube). 21 replicates of each of the following hemoglobin concentrations were
tested: 0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and 1000 ng/mL.
a. The samples stored at 30ºC and 40ºC were tested on 0, 6, 11, 14 and 15 days with sample
stability in the Sample Collection tube was acceptable for up to 14 days.
b. For refrigerated conditions, two temperature conditions were tested. Samples were stored at
2–8°C and -10 to -20ºC and testing was performed at 0, 30 and 32 days. Based on the results,
the fecal sample in the Sample Collection tube can be stored for up to 30 days under
refrigerated conditions.
Reagent Stability Studies
a. Realtime Shelf-life Stability Studies
The real time stability study was conducted with three lots of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100
Test Cartridge Kits (including the Test Cartridge and the Sample Collection tube). A total of
three operators at a single site with one device of the Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Reader

with Sample Tray was used to perform the study. Two storage temperatures (4°C and 30°C)
were tested. Time points used in the real-time stability study included: 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36
and 37 months. Test cartridge kits were retrieved and tested with different hemoglobin
concentrations at the end of each designated time point in the study. Seven hemoglobin
concentrations of 0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and 1000 ng/mL were used. The testing was done
with 21 replicates for each concentration level. Based on the real-time stability results, the
current data supports the shelf-life of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test Cartridge Kits
(including the Test Cartridge and the Sample Collection tube) for up to 24 months at both
4°C and 30°C.
b. Transportation Stability Studies
The shipping study was conducted to evaluate the shipping stress to the Hemosure Accu-
Reader A100 Sample Collection tube and its endurance under extreme temperatures.
Before sampling: The Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Sample Collection tubes (containing no
fecal samples) were stored at -10°C, 2–8°C, 25°C and 40°C for different time points (0, 3, 5
and 6 days). Tests were performed with 21 replicates of each hemoglobin concentration (0,
80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and 1000 ng/mL) at the end of each designed time point of the study.
The study was conducted at one site with one lot of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test
Cartridge Kit on a single analyzer. The results demonstrate that the Hemosure Accu-Reader
A100 Sample Collection tubes (before sampling) can be stable for five days under the
shipping temperatures of -10°C to 40°C.
After sampling: The Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Sample Collection tubes were tested by
21 replicates of hemoglobin free fecal samples spiked with seven different concentrations of
hemoglobin (0, 80, 100, 110, 120, 140 and 1000 ng/mL). After sampling, the Hemosure
Accu-Reader A100 Sample Collection tubes were stored at -10°C, 2–8°C, 25°C and 40°C for
different time points (0, 3, 5 and 6 days). Tests were performed with 21 replicates of each
hemoglobin concentration at the end of each designed time point of the study. The study was
conducted at one site with one lot of Hemosure Accu-Reader A100 Test Cartridge Kit on a
single analyzer. The results demonstrate that the Accu-Reader A100 Sample Collection tubes
(after sampling) can be stable for five days under the shipping temperatures of -10°C to
40°C.
