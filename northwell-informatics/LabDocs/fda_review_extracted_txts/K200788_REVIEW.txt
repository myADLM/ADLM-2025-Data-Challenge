III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the Assure Titanium Blood
Glucose meter and the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose test strips. The Assure Titanium Blood
Glucose Monitoring System is intended for use in the quantitative measurement of glucose in
fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips. The system is intended for in
vitro diagnostic, point of care use in endocrinology clinics and nursing or skilled nursing
facilities, for multiple patient use. This system should only be used with single-use, auto-
disabling lancing devices for drawing finger stick capillary blood.
The system is not intended for the screening or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but is indicated for
use in determining dysglycemia.
The system is not intended for use in acute care or hospital settings.
The system is not intended for neonatal use.
The system is for prescription use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For point-of-care use only.
In vitro diagnostic use.
Not for Alternative Site Testing (AST).
Do not use the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring System for screening or diagnosis of
diabetes.
Not indicated for use in patients undergoing tight glycemic control.
Do not use the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring System to test neonates. The Assure
Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring System has not been validated for neonatal use.
Do not use at altitudes higher than 10,000 ft (3048 m) above sea level.
Use only Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Test Strips for testing with the Assure Titanium Blood
Glucose Meter.
Assure Titanium device should not be used in patients receiving intensive medical intervention/
therapy because of the potential for pre-analytical collection error and specifically in patients
with decreased peripheral blood flow, as it may not reflect the true physiological state when test
results are generated using capillary whole blood samples. Examples include, but are not limited
to, severe hypotension, shock, hyperosmolar-hyperglycemia (with or without ketosis) and severe
dehydration.

D Special Instrument Requirements:
Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Meter
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a battery-powered Assure
Titanium Blood Glucose meter, disposable single-use Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Test
Strips, Assure Control-Control Solutions (Level 1, 2 and Level 3), Quick Reference Guide and
User Manual. Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Test Strips and Assure Control-Control Solutions
are not included in the kit package and should be purchased separately. The candidate test strips
were previously cleared in k170064 as part of the GLUCOCARD W Blood Glucose Monitoring
System.
B Principle of Operation:
The Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures the amount of glucose in
capillary whole blood from the fingertip quantitatively, using amperometric technology. The test
is based on the measurement of the electric current generated by the reaction of the capillary
whole blood glucose with glucose oxidase (GOD) and a mediator on the test strip
(hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride). The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to
the glucose concentration in the sample. The detected current signal is then calculated by the
meter and glucose concentration reading is then displayed on the meter.
Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Meter
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The system is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. The
whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
4. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The detection of the calibration
code is automatic.
K200788 - Page 3 of 29

--- Page 4 ---
5. Quality Control:
The Assure Control - Control Solutions are aqueous solutions available at three different
glucose levels (Level 1: 40 mg/L ± 11% glucose, Level 2: 130 mg/L ± 11% glucose, and
Level 3: 360 mg/dL ± 11% glucose). Instructions on how to order control solutions, and
when to perform a control solution test are included in the labeling. The acceptable range for
each control level is printed on the test strip bottle or on the bottom of the test strip box. The
meter automatically recognizes and flags the test result in the memory as a control solution
test result. The user is cautioned not to use the meter and to contact the customer support if
the control result falls outside the ranges printed on the test strip vial label.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and intermediate precision for the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring
System were evaluated to assess imprecision of the system across the glucose measuring
range and under normal use conditions.
Within-run precision was evaluated using venous whole blood spiked with high
concentration glucose solution or allowed to glycolyze to achieve 5 glucose concentrations
(30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250 and 250-400 mg/dL). Each level was tested with three lots
of test strips in replicates of 10 on each of 10 meters for a total of 300 results per glucose
concentration and 1500 results total. Results for the within-run precision testing are
summarized in the table below.

Intermediate precision was evaluated using 5 control solutions at glucose levels within the
ranges of 30-50, 51-100, 111-150, 151-250, and 251-400 mg/dL. Multiple operators tested
the control solutions over 10 days using 3 lots of test strips and 10 meters, conducting one
measurement per meter per day at the different glucose ranges. This resulted in 50 tests per
lot per day for a total of 1500 tests. Results for intermediate precision testing are summarized
in the table below.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using
venous whole blood spiked with high concentration glucose solution or allowed to glycolyze
to achieve 11 glucose concentrations (6.3, 31.2, 46.9, 68.9, 135.0, 197.0, 254.5, 351.9, 421.0,
493.5 and 613.3 mg/dL). The target glucose concentrations were verified by the comparator
method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus analyzer). Results on the candidate device were compared to
results on the comparator. Each glucose level was tested using 3 test strip lots and 5 meters,
for a total of 15 replicates per level and a total of 165 results.

Linear regression data analysis, with regression equation and coefficient of determination
(R2) presented for each lot tested is summarized in the table below:
Lot Linear Regression Equation R2
1 y = 1.0079x + 3.9485 0.9988
2 y = 1.0063x + 3.3727 0.9993
3 y = 0.9902x + 2.1839 0.9999
The results of the study support linearity of the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring
System across the claimed measuring range of 10-600 mg/dL. If the concentration of a
sample is less than 10 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as “Lo”. If a sample
exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as “Hi”. The “Lo” and “Hi”
functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference testing was conducted to evaluate the effect of common endogenous substances
and exogenous substances expected in the intended use population on the Assure Titanium
Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Additional potential interferents were included in the
testing following a detailed analysis of medications and medical conditions of the subjects
evaluated in the method comparison study (please see the tables in Section VII.B.1 below for
a detailed list of medications and conditions). The study was designed using whole blood
samples spiked or allowed to glycolyze to 3 target glucose levels (50-70 mg/dL, 110-130
mg/dL, and 225-270 mg/dL). Samples were divided into a test pool with the potential
interferent added and a control sample with no added interferent. Each interferent was tested
at clinically relevant concentrations.
Results on the candidate meter from the test samples were compared to results obtained on
the candidate meter from the control sample. If interference was observed, additional testing
was performed to determine the concentration at which the interference starts to occur.
Potentially interfering substances, the maximum concentrations tested and the highest tested
concentration at which no significant interference (defined by the sponsor as average % bias
≤ 10%) was observed are listed in the table below:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The performance of the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring System was established
in the intended use environment using capillary fingerstick samples from 396 patients at
three clinical sites covering the two intended use settings (one nursing and skilled nursing
facility and two endocrinology clinics) across the United States using untrained intended use
operators (point-of-care operators). Site 1 was a 475-bed nursing and skilled nursing site. The
study took place across both the long-term care nursing and rehabilitation unit (also known as
a temporary care unit). Sites 2 and 3 were endocrinology clinics.
All testing with the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Meter was performed by CLIA waived
operators (non-laboratory personnel, e.g., registered nurses/licensed practical nurses, medical
aides, office manager, receptionist).
The glucose levels tested ranged from 29.0 to 492.5 mg/L, with 32 results falling below 80
mg/dL and 22 results falling above 300 mg/dL. The hematocrit and sodium levels for all
subjects tested were recorded. Testing was performed on six lots of Assure Titanium test
strips using 26 Assure Titanium meters. The clinical study included subjects with reported
390 unique patient medical conditions receiving a total of 4066 unique medications, that
accounted for 379 drugs classified by generic name, representing 14 main drug classes
including nervous system, cardiovascular system, and alimentary tract and metabolism drug
classes.
The Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring System results were compared to the YSI
2300 STAT Plus as the comparator method. The results were calculated separately for each
type of clinical site as well as all sites combined.

Glucose Meter compared to the results from the comparator method, per site type, as well as

The sponsor also conducted a usability study of the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose
Monitoring System. The 10 point-of-care operators who participated in the study filled out
two questionnaires: one concerning the ease of the use of the blood glucose system and one
concerning the ease of understanding of the user manual and QRG. The results demonstrated
that the participants were able to understand the labeling and conduct the testing on their
own.
A readability assessment using SMOG analysis was conducted, and the results demonstrate
that the of the user manual and quick reference guide (QRG) were written at a 7.4 and 7.2
grade level, respectively.

Accuracy at extreme glucose values:
An additional study was conducted to further assess the performance of the Assure Titanium
Blood Glucose Monitoring System at the extreme upper and lower ends of the claimed
measuring range. The sponsor altered 100 capillary whole blood samples from healthy
donors, by spiking or allowing samples to glycolyze, to obtain 50 samples with glucose
concentrations below 80 mg/dL (22.3-72.8 mg/dL, as measured by the comparator method)
and 50 samples with glucose concentrations above 300 mg/dL (303.5-577.3 mg/dL, as
measured by the comparator method).
Samples were tested on the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Meter by intended use operators,
using test strips from 3 lots and compared with the results obtained on the comparator
method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus). The results are summarized below:

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of hematocrit on the performance of the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose
Monitoring System was evaluated at 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% 50%,
55%, 60%, 65% and 70% hematocrit levels, and at 5 glucose concentrations (30-50, 51-110,
111-150, 151-250 and 251-400 mg/dL). Each sample was tested in replicates of 10 using 10
meters and 3 lots of test strips, for a total of 30 replicates per sample. The values were
compared with the glucose measurements obtained from the comparator method (YSI 2300
STAT Plus). The results of the study demonstrated adequate performance to support the
claimed hematocrit range of 10-70%.
2. Altitude Study:
A simulated high-altitude study was conducted in a pressure chamber to simulate the effects
of sea level (<500 ft) and high-altitude (10,000 ft) on the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose
Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples adjusted to 3 glucose concentrations (55-
77, 114-144 and 316-356 mg/dL) were tested in replicates of 10, using 10 meters and 3 lot of
test strips, for a total of 30 replicates per sample, per condition. Values measured by the
candidate device were compared with the glucose measurements obtained from the
comparator method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus). The results of the study support the claim that
the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring System can be operated at altitudes of up to
10,000 ft (3,048 meters).
3. System Operating Conditions:
To assess the performance of the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring System when
used under various operating temperature and humidity conditions, the system was tested at
four different temperature and humidity conditions including low temperature/low humidity
(8 °C/10% RH), low temperature/high humidity (8 °C/90% RH), high temperature/low
humidity (40 °C/10% RH) and high temperature/high humidity (40 °C/90% RH). Each of 3
venous whole blood glucose levels (55-77, 114-144 and 316-356 mg/dL) were tested by 10
meters, using 3 lots of test strips, for a total of 10 replicates per sample, per condition. Values
measured by the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring System were compared to the
comparator method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus). The study results support the labeled operating
conditions claim of 8-40°C (46-104°F) and 10-90% RH.

4. Sample Volume Study:
The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5 μL for
the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples with 3
glucose concentrations (50-65, 100-120 and 200-250 mg/dL) were tested at 6 sample
volumes (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 and 10.0 μL) using 3 lots of test strips. Values obtained
were compared to the comparator method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus). Results support the
claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5 μL for the system. The meter has an error message
displayed if enough blood is not added to the test strip. This feature was validated and was
shown to function as intended.
5. Flex Studies:
Intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, testing with used test strips and a variety of
mechanical/durability testing (i.e., drop, vibration and compression testing) was completed
by the sponsor. The testing performed demonstrated that the Assure Titanium Blood Glucose
Monitoring System is robust to these expected use scenarios.
6. Cleaning and Disinfection Robustness Evaluation:
The device is intended for multiple-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed
on the on the exterior meter materials by an outside commercial testing laboratory,
demonstrating complete inactivation of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) with the chosen
