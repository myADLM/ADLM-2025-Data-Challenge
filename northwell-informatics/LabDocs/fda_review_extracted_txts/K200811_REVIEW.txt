IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The cobas u 701 is a fully automated urine particle analyzer that is used in the clinical laboratory
to analyze formed elements in urine samples quantitatively, semi-quantitatively and qualitatively
for the presence of particles in the sample. The cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer is a stand-alone
system and incorporates a robotic liquid handling system that pipettes an aliquot of the specimen
into a disposable cuvette. The filled cuvette is forwarded to the built-in centrifuge for
centrifugation of the non-soluble particles. After the centrifugation, all particles are brought to
one monolayer to ensure they are all at the same focal plane. A built-in camera takes pictures
through a built-in microscope at several positions of the sediment. All images are evaluated by
an image processing software which is able to detect and further classify the following urine
particles. Particle concentration is calculated using the average count from the assessed images.
The cobas u 701 reports analysis results for two quantitative parameters in urine: RBC and
WBC, three semi-quantitative parameters: SEC (Squamous epithelial cells), HYA (Hyaline
casts) and BAC (Bacteria), and six qualitative parameters: NEC (Non-squamous epithelial cells),
PAT (Pathological casts), CRY (Crystals), YEA (Yeast), SPRM (Sperm) and MUC (Mucus).
The cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer performs a maximum theoretical throughput of up to 116
samples per hour.
The cobas u 701 consists of several major components:
• Rack transport system
• Liquid handling system
• Cuvette cassette compartment
• Centrifuge
• Built-in reverse microscope with movable objective lens for focusing procedure
• High resolution camera system
• Touch Screen
• Inbuilt Computer with the imaging and evaluation software for analyzing the sediment
pictures

bacteria, and hyaline casts and the qualitative determination of non-squamous epithelial cells,
crystals, yeasts, pathological casts, mucus, and sperm in urine with the cobas u 701 microscopy
analyzer. The cobas u cuvette is for professional use only.
The cobas u cuvette is used by the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer to transport, centrifuge and
analyze patient and control samples. They are provided separately from the analyzer, in a box
holding 400 disposable cuvettes.
Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Human urine
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The analyzer auto-identifies and processes barcoded tube specimens in 5-position racks by
mixing, sampling, and analyzing automatically.
4. Calibration:
No calibration of the device is necessary for its intended use. However, there is a microscope
check, which is not a calibration of the device. This microscope check ensures proper
functioning of the focusing mechanism of the microscope utilizing a reference cuvette.
The reference cuvette is a cuvette with the same dimensions as the sample cuvette, which
contains a transparent material with a standardized number of erythrocyte like particles
etched in it. For differentiation from the sample cuvettes, the reference cuvette is green and
marked with the letter R on the top. This microscope check confirms that the instrument is
able to focus accurately on the position of the particles and to count correctly the number of
the cells. This microscope check needs to be performed every 4 weeks. A message from the
instrument informs the operator when it is due.
5. Quality Control:
Recommendation of commercially available control solutions.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a. Repeatability Study
Repeatability (within-run precision) was evaluated using 3 control samples and 3 residual
natural urine specimens without preservatives around the low and high end of the
analytical measuring range. All used specimen (controls, human samples) were measured
in 2 runs, 21 determinations each, producing n = 42 results per specimen. Testing was
conducted across two sites using a single analyzer at each site and four different cuvette
lots. All predefined acceptance criteria were met.

b. Intermediate Precision
Intermediate precision was performed according to CLSI EP5-A3 to assess long-term
precision of the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer. However, due to the instability of the
human urine samples, only control samples were measured for this study. This
assessment was limited to the parameters included in the control material (RBC, WBC).
All predefined acceptance criteria were met.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer was determined for the two quantitative
parameters RBC and WBC using one lot of cobas u cuvette and one cobas u 701 instrument.
Linear regression was calculated according CLSI EP6-A.
Urine specimen pools were created by diluting and spiking natural urine samples with human
RBC and WBC particles to cover the full measuring range for each quantitative parameter.
One dilution series was prepared for each parameter (RBC & WBC). The RBC linearity set
consisted of 25 serial dilutions. The WBC linearity set consisted of 23 serial dilutions. Each
dilution concentration was measured in 4-fold determination in a randomized order. For
evaluation, every single result was plotted against expected concentrations. Then linearity
regression was calculated according CLSI EP6-A by a statistical software tool. The results
obtained for RBC and WBC using the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer met the defined
acceptance criteria. Data analysis showed linearity for RBC and WBC was achieved through
polynomial regression. The linearity was confirmed for a linearity range for RBC from 5–
2160 p/μL and WBC from 5–1080 p/μL. The measuring ranges for RBC (5–1800 p/μL) and
WBC (5–900 p/μL) were covered by the linearity experiment.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The interference study assessed the potential interferences that may occur on the cobas u 701
microscopy analyzer due to its measurement technology; clinical samples were assessed for
the individual interferents. The study was determined by using four instruments and nine
cuvette lots, on 670 native urine samples. Because of the imaging technology on the cobas u
701 microscopy analyzer, testing according EP07-A2 considered only visual/physical
interferents; interference of drugs or endogenous substances is not applicable. Interference
was confirmed, if the analyzer classification result was different than the visual classification
result (KOVA manual counting). Native human urine samples containing the following
interfering particles were measured on the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzers: high
concentrations of mucus strands, artifacts, clumps, cell fragments, dysmorphic cells, shining
particles, crowded samples, diluted samples, highly viscous samples, and high turbidity
(Intralipid) samples. Furthermore, challenging native urine samples including amorphous
crystals and trichomonas were evaluated. Based on the technological characteristics of the
manual microscopy method, when measuring the following particles in the sample on the
cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer, there is the potential that an incorrect result may be
obtained.
Potential interfering particles and results
Particle / Sample Result on cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer
Particles may be underrepresented in samples with high amounts of mucus.
Artifacts like fibers, hairs or dust may interfere with the result. Therefore,
Mucus and artefacts clean sampling and storage is important. A wrong classification of these
particles can lead to false positive results. Large artefacts may cause
defocused particles, which will be misclassified or not detected.
Clumps of cells, clumps of cell fragments, cell fragments of particles and or
aggregations of particles may lead to misclassification. Also, dysmorphic
Clumps, fragments, aggregations, cells may lead to a misclassification. Therefore, the standard sample
and dysmorphic cells stability and sample storage conditions should be followed. The sample
itself should be mixed gently before testing.
Granules of amorphous urates with tendency to aggregate as coarse irregular
dark masses may be detected as Bacteria (BAC). This depends on the size of
the urates. Urates are a subclass of crystals (CRY) and should be identified as
Amorphous urates CRY within the image. If the crystals are really small, they may be detected
as BAC. BAC is not labeled in the images as the estimation for BAC is based
on the ratio of occupied to non-occupied space.
Certain forms of Bacteria (BAC) with a tendency to arrange in groups may
Misclassification of Bacteria be detected as Crystal (CRY) or Sperm (SPRM).
Shining particles Shining particles sometimes may lead to misclassification.
In case of high positive samples like RBC, WBC, SEC, BAC and CRY, where
the images are crowded, the particles with high concentration may obscure
those of lower concentration. This is due to the fact that the particles are
Crowded samples centrifuged to a single layer, the focal plane. Such samples are not evaluated by
the algorithm, they are marked with an “Uc” and must be reviewed by the user.
If the concentration of the quantitative parameters exceeds 1800 p/µL for RBC
or 900 p/µL for WBC, the samples are marked with “O” (Parameter is out of
range).

misclassification due to changes in cell size or shape or the decrease in number
of the cells.
4. Accuracy (Instrument):
To assess the accuracy of the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer, a method comparison study
was performed versus manual counting using KOVA chamber as the defined reference
method was performed utilizing clinical samples. Six cobas u cuvette lots and one cobas u
701 instrument per site were used to perform the measurements. Measurements were
performed at three sites, each using one cobas u 701 instrument per site and six cobas u
cuvette lots. Statistical analysis was then performed comparing the cobas u 701 results and
the KOVA chamber results.
Patient demographics included both males and females ranging in age from 1 month old to
98 years of age (355 females, 334 males and 91 pediatrics). A total of 168 subjects with
known clinical conditions (kidney, infectious, and metabolic diseases) and 521 subjects with
either healthy or unknown clinical condition urine samples were tested. For quantitative
parameters, regression analysis (Passing-Bablok), including 95% confidence intervals (CI)
and estimates of the bias/difference were calculated for each parameter. In addition, Bland-
Altman plots were generated to show the differences between the two devices for all
reportable parameters. For both semi-quantitative and qualitative parameters, the agreement
rates, including positive percentage agreement (PPA), negative percentage agreement (NPA)
and the lower end 95% confidence limits were calculated.
The results of the method comparison studies performed between cobas u 701 microscopy
analyzer and visual counting using the KOVA chamber are shown below. All obtained
statistical results from the single sites as well as for the compiled data sets were within the
defined specifications and confirmed the substantial equivalence of the automated cobas u
701 microscopy analyzer with the manual KOVA counting method.

5. Carry-Over:
Carryover was evaluated by testing residual urine samples without preservatives with high
RBC, WBC, BAC, SEC, HYA, YEA, SPRM, and CRY at two sites, using five cobas u
cuvette lots and one cobas u 701 instrument per site. First, a negative sample was measured
in 25 determinations (reference run). Afterwards, sample blocks with five samples each were
measured in alternate measurement mode. Alternating measurements of samples with high
and negative concentrations were performed, meaning a high concentration sample block
(n=5) was measured, then a negative sample block (n=5) was measured, and then a high
concentration sample block was measured (n=5), etc.
Each block was measured 5 times for a total of 25 results for the high sample and 25 results
for the negative sample. Statistical calculations for the quantitative parameters comprised
calculation of mean and standard deviation for the reference run. For the semi-quantitative

and qualitative parameters, the results of the negative samples after positive sample testing
were assessed to confirm that they were still “negative”. The results of the Sample Carry-
over assessment for the defined parameters performed on the cobas u 701 microscopy
analyzer using the cobas u cuvette met the predefined acceptance criteria.
B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB)
Limit of Blank (LoB) of the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer was determined using one lot
of cobas u cuvette and three cobas u 701 microscopy analyzers. The LoB is the highest
observed measured value for samples free of analyte. The Limit of Blank was determined as
the 95th percentile of the measurement of blank samples. Five samples per analyte were
prepared fresh every day and tested on 3 days. Each day, two runs were performed with five
samples measured in singlicate per run. Thirty results were collected for each parameter on
each instrument for a total of 90 results per parameter. To determine the LoB, the 90 results
for each parameter were sorted low to high. Using the nonparametric approach,
determination of the 95th percentile was calculated from the mean of the 85th and 86th
ranked results. All predefined acceptance criteria were met. The LoB was determined as
follows:
Parameter Units LoB Result
RBC RBC/μL 0.0
WBC WBC/μL 0.0
SEC SEC/μL 0.0
HYA HYA/μL 0.0
BAC BAC/μL 2
Limit of Detection (LoD)
Limit of Detection (LoD) of the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer was determined using one
lot of cobas u cuvette and three cobas u 701 microscopy analyzers. LoD determines the
detection limit for samples with low analyte concentration. The LoD was determined as the
lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with a 95% probability. Five
samples per parameter were measured. Each sample was measured in a 10-fold determination
on each of the three analyzers. Measurements were performed on minimum 3 days. In total,
150 results were collected for each parameter. All predefined acceptance criteria were met.
The LoD was calculated as follows:
LoD = LoB + (1.648 x SD)
Parameter Units LoD Result
RBC RBC/μL 4.0
WBC WBC/μL 3.0
SEC SEC/μL 4.0
HYA HYA/μL 1.4

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer was determined using
one lot of cobas u cuvette and three cobas u 701 microscopy analyzers. LoQ is defined as the
lowest analyte concentration in a sample that can be reproducibly measured. LoQ was
determined for the quantitative parameters RBC and WBC with the same set of samples
applied for the LoD determination. LoQ for RBC and WBC parameters met the predefined
acceptance criteria.

2. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Calibration:
No calibration of the device is necessary due to different particle detection technology.
However, there is a microscope check, which is not a calibration of the device. This
microscope check ensures proper functioning of the focusing mechanism of the microscope
utilizing a reference cuvette. This microscope check needs to be performed every 4 weeks. A
message from the instrument informs the operator when it is due.
Quality control:
Recommendation of commercially available control solutions.
3. Sample Stability:
Sample stability testing was performed using anonymized fresh human urine samples and
measuring these samples at three different time points: 1) T0 - 0 h sample lifetime; 2) T1 - 2
h sample lifetime, and; 3) T2 - 3 h sample lifetime.
The urine samples were divided into four aliquots, thereof one for each time point and one
for visual determination of the parameters SG (specific gravity) and pH with Chemstrip 10
UA test strips. Prior to and between the measurements of the different time points, the
samples were stored at room temperature. For each testing point, a 4-fold determination was
performed of urine samples on the cobas u 701 microscopy analyzer to rule out imprecision
effects, unrelated to the analyte stability. In parallel to the instrument reading, a single
determination with Chemstrip 10 UA was done at each time point of the same sample to
determine the SG and pH values. The results obtained for sample stability using the cobas u
701 microscopy analyzer met the defined acceptance criteria. The pH and SG measured
values remain unchanged over the entire measuring time. Data analysis showed sample
stability for negative and positive flagged samples passed at time T2 (3 h) when stored at
room temperature, one time-point below the sample stability claim of 2 hours.
