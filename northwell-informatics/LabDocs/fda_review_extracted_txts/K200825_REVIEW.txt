The NOVEOS Immunoassay Analyzer is a high-throughput, highly automated immunoassay
platform that employs magnetic microbeads as the solid phase. The immunoassay reaction takes
place in individual reaction chambers in the reaction rotor, with other rotors containing patient
samples and reagents. Liquids are moved by robotic pipettors. The reaction is quantitated by a
combination of chemiluminescence and fluorescence measurements compared to a calibration
curve, all performed by the analyzer with the NOVEOS software.
B Principle of Operation:
The NOVEOS specific IgE (sIgE) Assay is an immunometric, chemiluminescent assay for the
quantitative determination of IgE of known specificity in human serum samples. Magnetic beads
coated with streptavidin and fluorescent dye are incubated with a biotinylated allergen that binds
to the streptavidin molecule on the surface of the beads. The beads are collected by use of a
magnetic field to remove the liquid, and then undergo a wash step to remove unbound
biotinylated allergen prior to incubation with the sample. If present in the sample, sIgE binds to
the captured biotinylated allergen. After incubation, the beads are washed and subsequently
incubated with an HRP-labeled anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (Conjugate IgE) to form an
antibody-conjugate complex that is bound to the captured biotinylated allergen. After washing
away the non-bound conjugate, a chemiluminescent substrate is added to the assay mixture
resulting in light generation in proportion to the amount of antibody-conjugate that has been
bound to the beads. The fluorescence is used to correct for any bead loss during the assay, and
the (corrected) chemiluminescence is compared to a calibration curve to provide quantification
of bound sIgE. The higher the value of chemilumiscent signal detected by the instrument, the
higher the amount of sIgE detected in the sample tested.

*One result was excluded from the final analysis dataset. The test result had an error flag for
insufficient sample volume that was attributed to a bubble; the test was not repeated.
2. Linearity:
Linearity of each NOVEOS sIgE Assay was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP6-A by
preparing three sets of dilution panel. Three positive serum samples (low, medium and high
level) were each serially diluted in a two-fold scheme with a negative serum pool generating
at least five consecutive dilutions. Each diluted sample was tested in replicates of five and
each neat sample was tested in replicates of 15, all within one assay run using one reagent lot
on one NOVEOS Immunoassay Analyzer. Results of the replicates for all three samples were
analyzed for linearity. Regression statistics comparing the observed results (y) to expected
results (x) of all samples in each and all three dilution panels are presented in the tables
below.

range from 0.17 kU/L to 100 kU/L for both the NOVEOS sIgE Assay, E001 and NOVEOS
sIgE Assay, G006.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a) Inhibition study:
Immunological specificity of E001 (Cat Dander, Felis domesticus) and G006 (Timothy
Grass, Phleum pretense) allergens was verified through competitive inhibition according
to CLSI guideline I/LA20-A3. A positive sample with specific IgE concentration of ~7.6
kU/L for E001 and ~0.6 kU/L for G006 was used in the inhibition studies. The allergen
solution (inhibitor) was diluted into the positive serum sample to achieve a starting
concentration of 15 µg/mL for E001 and 50 µg/mL for G006. The sample solution was
serially diluted five times in two-fold increments and each diluted sample was evaluated
for dose-dependent inhibition in five replicates with one lot of reagent. The results of the
dose-dependent inhibition study showed that >50% inhibition was achieved with E001
and G006 at a final inhibitor concentration of 15 µg/mL and 25 µg/mL, respectively.
For the NOVEOS sIgE Assay, E001, the related allergen E006 (guinea pig epithelia,
Cavia porcellus), and the unrelated allergens, G013 (velvet grass, Holcus lanatus), W011
(Russian thistle, Salsola kali)) and M004 (Mucor circinelloides f. lusitanicus) were tested
as potential inhibitors for at a final concentration of at least ten times the concentration of
E001 at which >50% inhibition was achieved. All allergen inhibitors were spiked into the
positive serum sample at a 1:1 dilution and evaluated with three lots of NOVEOS sIgE
Assay, E001. The results of the single-dose inhibition studies using one related allergen
(E006) and three unrelated allergens (G013, W011 and M004) did not show inhibition at
a test concentration of 150 µg/mL for the related allergen and 150 µg/mL for the three
unrelated allergens. The inhibition studies indicate that the NOVEOS sIgE Assay, E001
contains the immunologically relevant allergen.

For the NOVEOS sIgE Assay, G006, the related allergen G202 (cultivated corn, Zia
mays), and the unrelated allergens, W043 (common sagebrush, Artemisia tridentata),
F018 (brazil nut, Bertholletia excelsa) and M004 (Mucor circinelloides f. lusitanicus)
were tested as potential inhibitors at a final concentration of at least ten times the
concentration of G006 at which >50% inhibition was achieved. All allergen inhibitors
were spiked into the positive serum sample at a 1:1 dilution and evaluated with three lots
of NOVEOS sIgE Assay, G006. The results of the single-dose inhibition studies using
one related allergen (G202) and three unrelated allergens (W043, F018 and M004) did
not show inhibition at a test concentration of 250 µg/mL for the related allergen and 250
µg/mL for the three unrelated allergens. The inhibition studies indicate that the NOVEOS
sIgE Assay, G006 contains the immunologically relevant allergen.
b) Interference:
(1) Endogenous Substance Interference:
The effect of the presence of elevated level of human albumin, hemoglobin,
triglyceride, conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, and rheumatoid factor in
serum samples was evaluated by testing three (one negative, one near the cut-off
and one positive) serum sample pools spiked with varying levels of each interferent
and analyzed in 12 replicates in one assay run with three lots of each NOVEOS
sIgE Assay. The % recovery for each sample spiked with the potential interfering
substance was calculated by comparing its result to that of the corresponding
reference sample spiked with an equal volume of the solvent without the interfering
substance. No interference was noted for samples containing human serum albumin
up to 120 g/L, hemoglobin up to 200 mg/dL, intralipid up to 3000 mg/dL,
conjugated bilirubin up to 30 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin up to 20 mg/dL, and
rheumatoid factor up to 513 IU/mL.
(2) Exogenous Substance Interference:
The same protocol used in the endogenous substance interference study was used to
evaluate potentially interfering exogenous substances. No interference was noted
for samples containing biotin at a concentration of 3500 ng/mL, diphenhydramine
at 19.6 µmol/L, methylprednisolone at 1000 ng/mL, omalizumab at 0.12 mg/mL
and ranitidine at 19.1 µmol/L.
c) Cross-reactivity:
The potential cross-reactivity of non-IgE (IgA, IgD, IgG, and IgM) to the NOVEOS sIgE
Assay, E001 and NOVEOS sIgE Assay, G006 was evaluated by testing two separate
panel, one consisting of three human serum samples (one negative and two positives
including one near 0.35 kU/L for E001) and another consisting of five human serum
samples (one negative and four positives including one near 0.35 kU/L for G006). Each
serum sample was spiked with the immunoglobulin stock solutions containing IgA, IgG,
and IgM (IgGAM) at 76.86 mg/mL and IgD at 77.25 mg/mL. The control samples were
prepared by adding a solvent to mimic the IgGAM and IgD spiked volumes. Test and
control samples were analyzed in replicates of three in one assay run with one lot of the
reagent. The % recovery was calculated by comparing measurements of the test and
K200825 - Page 10 of 16

--- Page 11 ---
control samples. No cross reactivity was noted up to 14.86 mg/mL for IgGAM and up to
0.173 mg/mL for IgD.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The claimed measuring range is from 0.17 kU/L to 100 kU/L.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability:
The IgE calibrators are traceable to the World Health Organization (WHO) third
International Standard 11/234 of Human Serum Immunoglobulin E.
b) Kit Stability:
Shelf life stability: Both an ongoing real-time stability study and an accelerated stability
study were performed in accordance with CLSI EP25-A using three lots of the NOVEOS
E001 Capture Reagent and three lots of the NOVEOS G006 Capture Reagent. The
accelerated stability data support the manufacturer’s claim of 24-month unopened shelf-
life stability for both the NOVEOS E001 Capture Reagent and NOVEOS G006 Capture
Reagent. The real-time stability study is on-going and available data supports 16 months
unopened shelf-life stability for both the NOVEOS E001 Capture Reagent and NOVEOS
G006 Capture Reagent when stored at 2–8 °C per the manufacturer’s instruction for use.
All other reagents required to perform specific IgE testing on the NOVEOS system are
not allergen specific and the shelf-life stability of these reagents has been previously
established per K182479, with the exception of the Fluo Beads reagent which has an
extended shelf-life stability of up to 24 months based on the real-time stability data per
K191510. The claimed shelf-life for individual assay components is listed in the table

6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the
NOVEOS sIgE Assay, E001 and the NOVEOS sIgE Assay, G006 on the NOVEOS
Immunoassay Analyzer were determined according to CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
LoB was determined by testing five IgE-free human serum samples in two replicates per run,
one run per day, for six days using three lots of each NOVEOS sIgE Assay. The runs were
spread out on three different NOVEOS Immunoassay Analyzers. The LoB was estimated as
the 95th percentile of 60 measurements for each of the lots tested.
LoD was determined using five serum samples with low IgE concentrations with the
NOVEOS sIgE Assay, E001 and six serum samples with low IgE concentrations with the
NOVEOS sIgE Assay, G006. Each sample was tested in replicates of 10 replicates per run,
one run per day, for six days using three lots of each NOVEOS sIgE Assay. The runs were
spread out on three different NOVEOS Immunoassay Analyzers. The LoD was determined
for each lot based on 300 measurements for E001 or 360 measurements for G006 as the mean
concentration of the lowest sample with 95% or more of its replicates recovering above the
LoB.
LoQ was determined as functional sensitivity using a set of five samples with low IgE
concentrations. Each sample was tested in duplicates per run, two runs per day for 20 days
with three lots of each NOVEOS sIgE Assay on one instrument for a total of 80 data points
per sample per reagent lot. The LoQ is defined as the mean value of the sample which fulfills
the specification for the total within-laboratory imprecision (<20%CV).

9. Carry-Over:
Evaluation of instrument carryover was conducted using one lot of reagent of each NOVEOS
sIgE Assay on three NOVEOS Immunoassay Analyzers. The carryover assessment is based
on five cycle counts per instrument. Pooled high-level patient samples with sIgE
concentrations ranging from 99.1 to 100.0 kU/L for E001 and from 81.2 to 89.8 for G006
were aliquoted into five tubes and the pooled low-patient samples with sIgE concentrations
of 0.04 and 0.05 kU/L for E001 and of 0.05 and 0.06 kU/L for G006, were aliquoted into 25
tubes. Each cycle consists of one high sample test followed by five low sample tests against
the E001 or G006 capture reagent. Low Sample 1 following High Sample is denoted as
“possibly affected” which has the highest chance of potential carryover thus leading to signal
change > 0.10 kU/L. Low Samples 3–5 is denoted as “very probably unaffected” and
therefore should not have elevated kU/L signal. Carryover assessment is done by measuring
the change (Δ) of [mean concentration of Low Sample 1] and [mean concentration of Low
Samples 3–5]. The results are summarized in the tables below:

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity/ Specificity:
To demonstrate the clinical performance of each NOVEOS sIgE Assay, test results of the
clinical samples from atopic and healthy, non-atopic donors evaluated in the method
comparison study were compared to a clinical diagnosis of allergy. The atopic donors
with a clinical history of allergy-like symptoms were identified as positive by skin prick
testing (SPT) and clinical history; and the non-atopic donors with no reported allergy.
Results are expressed as positive when a sample with a sIgE value is greater than or
equal to 0.35 kU/L or negative when a sample with a sIgE value is less than 0.35 kU/L
The clinical sensitivity and specificity in this study cohort are summarized in the

D Clinical Cut-Off:
The clinical cut-off of the assay is 0.35 kU/L. The interpretation of results of the assay uses the
following classification system:
Class Concentration (kU/L) Interpretation
0 <0.35 Negative
I 0.35 to <0.70
II 0.70 to <3.50
Positive with
III 0.35 to <17.50
increasing sIgE
IV 17.50 to <50.00
concentration
V 50.00 to <100.00
VI ≥100
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The expected value is negative (< 0.35 kU/L) for a specific allergen in a non-atopic person. Each
laboratory should establish its own expected value.
The expected value/reference range of NOVEOS sIgE, E001 and NOVEOS sIgE, G006 in the
normal population were evaluated by testing samples from 132 apparently healthy subjects in the
clinical study for E001 and 127 apparently healthy subjects in the clinical study for G006. All
samples were below <0.35 kU/L.
