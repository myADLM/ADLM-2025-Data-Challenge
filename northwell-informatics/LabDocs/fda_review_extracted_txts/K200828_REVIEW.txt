C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Athelas Home
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Athelas Home is an automated cell counter system which consists of the Athelas Home
analyzer and the Athelas Home Test Strips. The Athelas Home is identical to the Athelas One
(K181288) in its technology, all software, the analytes measured, all components, and usage
process. The Athelas Home has additional software and quality control safeguards to enable at-
home usage of the device. Additionally, results generated from the Athelas Home are not shown
to end-patients, rather are transmitted via the software directly to their healthcare provider. The
Athelas Home also has Remote Lockout capabilities, such that a healthcare provider or
manufacturer can remotely lock-out a device for safety in usage.
The Athelas Home Tests Strips collects a capillary whole blood sample to generate a layer of
cells for counting and image analysis. The Athelas Home Test Strips are comprised of an upper
optical panel, lower optical panel and a stain coated region containing methylene blue and cresyl
violet stains. The test strip channel is optically clear for the camera module to take pictures of the
cells in the blood sample.

A smartphone/tablet with the Athelas controlling mobile application is required to initiate a test
with the Athelas Home System. The smartphone/tablet models compatible to initiate testing are
those devices supporting iOS 9 and up, or Android 8 and up.
B Principle of Operation:
The Athelas Home uses image processing and microfluidics in order to measure WBC and
NEUT% values from whole blood in home settings. The Athelas Home system consists of the
Athelas Home analyzer and Athelas Home test strips. The Athelas Home test strips serve as both
a sample container and a reaction chamber. A capillary whole blood sample is directly
transferred via fingerstick to the Athelas Home test strip which automatically spreads the sample
into a monolayer. The pre-coated stain within the strip chamber interacts with the monolayer of
blood and stains the WBCs. The Athelas Home test strip is inserted into the Athelas Home
analyzer which utilizes a proximity sensor to lock in place. A servo stabilizes and auto-focuses
the blood sample, and then a stage actuator scans the strip across various fields while the optical
module takes multiple images of the cells across the monolayer. The images of the blood sample
are transmitted to the server where they are analyzed using a locked down image processing
algorithm. The algorithm recognizes the nucleation and WBCs to generate a WBC count and
NEUT% result based on the concentrations and types of cells present.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision:
Two separate precision studies were performed to evaluate the performance of the Athelas
Home by home users. The precision studies were conducted in the home environment with
an Athelas Home device system.
a. A group of 24 patients were instructed to conduct tests on the Athelas Home following
the instructions for use. Each patient collected two capillary whole blood samples from
finger pricks (from different fingers) within five minutes of each other, filling two unique
test strips for measurements. The precision profile approach was used to estimate
repeatability as shown in the table below.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device (At-Home Usability Study):
The study was performed to evaluate the performance of the Athelas Home analyzer in the
home setting when compared to the predicate device Athelas One. A total of 61 patients
(including patients with neutropenia, patients with autoimmune diseases, patients on
immunosuppressive oncology therapy and patients on clozapine) were enrolled in the study,
1–4 visits per patient. Patients (untrained operators) were instructed to conduct tests on the
Athelas Home following the labeling process. Fifteen (15) separate lots of test strips were
used across all patients in the study. Tests were conducted in a single measurement by home
users on the Athelas Home. The trained operators performed triplicate measurements on the
predicate device. The average of the triplicates on the predicate performed by trained
operator was used for comparison against the single measurement by self-testers and
caregivers on the Athelas Home device in the home settings. Passing-Bablok regression was
used to evaluate the performance of the Athelas Home. The tables presented below
demonstrate the correlation and estimated bias.

3. Flex Studies
Delay in Testing After Sample Collection
A study was conducted to evaluate whether there was measurand drift in the analyte results if
there was a delay between sampling and running the test strip on device. The study was to
test for the case where a user fills the strip and waits for up to 30 minutes before inserting it
into the device for analysis. Five different timepoints (5 minutes, 15 minutes, 25 minutes, 30
minutes and 35 minutes) were evaluated across two lots of test strips with two Athelas Home
devices. Nine whole blood samples covering the measuring range were used. The linear
regression analysis showed no significant measurand drift for tested samples. Results
validated the claimed stability up to 30 minutes.
Sample Strip Fill-Volume Testing
To determine whether the Athelas Home correctly handles variable amounts of blood
inserted into the test-strip, a study was conducted with variable amounts of blood inserted
into the test-strip using three K2EDTA whole blood samples with known WBC and NEUT%
values. Each volume sample (0 μL, 1.4 μL, 3.4 μL, and 5.4 μL) was tested in two replicates
by using one lot of test strips. Results were found acceptable and met the defined acceptance
criteria.
Tilt Testing
A study was conducted to determine whether the Athelas Home is robust against being
placed on tilted surfaces in different orientations. Three K2EDTA whole blood samples were
tested in two replicates with one lot of test strips on one device. One level of tilt angle was
tested (30 degrees) with the analyzer tested in four orientations (front to back, back to front,
left to right and right to left). Samples representing a low, normal, and abnormal (high) level
of WBC and Neut% were analyzed in triplicates in each test position. Results demonstrate
that the Athelas Home is not affected by tilted placement of the device.
Drop Testing
A study was conducted to determine whether the Athelas Home continues to return accurate
results after being dropped from multiple orientations and heights. 12 Athelas Home
analyzers were tested in accordance with ASTM 1469 - D03. The test method included
manual handling, vehicle stacking, loose load vibrations, vehicle vibrations. The Athelas
Home were assessed in the following ways: Verify no visible physical damage or
degradation; Verify the following functional characteristics (LED function, device stage
flatness, ABS surface damage, motor function, liner actuator function and camera function);
Verify a single run of the Auto-Check 3-Level Gridded Strip returns results within the
specification range. Results demonstrate that all devices continued to pass functional tests
after being subjected to the full testing schedules.

Temperature Testing
A study was conducted to verify the performance of the Athelas Home device and test strips
after extreme and varying temperature. The study was divided into two parts, one for the
analyzer, and another for the test strips. For the device, three Athelas Home devices were
placed in the given investigated temperature (-20ºC (extreme low), 20ºC (room temp), 40ºC
(extreme high)) for 12 hours and then allowed to return to room temperature for 4 hours. All
test strips came from a single lot stored only at room temperature. Auto-Check 3-Level
Gridded Strip were tested in three replicates on each device. For the test strips, three lots of
Athelas Home test strips were placed in the given temperature ((-20ºC (extreme low), 20ºC
(room temp), 40ºC (extreme high)) for 12 hours. The test strips were allowed to return at
room temperature for 4 hours. Auto-Check 3-Level Gridded Strip were tested in three
replicates on one device only stored at room temperature for each test strip lot. Results
demonstrate that both the Athelas Home device and Athelas Home test-strip meet
performance specifications after exposure to different temperatures.
Humidity Testing
A study was conducted to verify the performance of the Athelas Home under extreme
humidity conditions. The study evaluated the performance of the Athelas Home device after
exposure to RH levels (from 30% to 90% RH) outside of the recommended 60% RH. Three
Athelas Home analyzers were exposed to three separate simulated conditions for 72 hours.
For each simulated condition, tests were performed on the Athelas Home using Auto-Check
3-Level Gridded Strip (Low, Normal, and High) in three replicates. Results demonstrate that
the Athelas Home is functional even after exposure to relative humidity levels outside of the
specified operational range. Exposure to relative humidity levels within the range tested (up
to 72 hours) shows no impact on performance.
Vibration Testing
A study was conducted to ensure that the Athelas Home device can continue to function or
return appropriate error codes after exposure to extensive vibration in handling by a patient
or shipping. The analyzer was subjected to three levels of vibration: 4.8 millimeters/second
(mm/s), 10 mm/s, and 15 mm/s. Samples with different levels (low, medium and high) were
tested in triplicates at each vibration level. Results were compared to the same sample levels
tested without vibration. All results were within the acceptance criteria and no erroneous
results were produced. All low and abnormal (high) samples flagged and/or suppressed as
expected.
Ambient Room Light
A study was conducted to verify the performance of the Athelas Home device and test strips
for exposure in various ambient lighting conditions during operation. Three devices were
used in this study with one device in a fully dark room (0-20 lumens), second device in
ambient room light (400-600 lumens), and third device in bright sunlight (3000-6000
lumens). Each device was tested with three runs on an Auto-Check 3-Level Gridded Strip.
Results demonstrate that the Athelas Home is capable of performing in a range of ambient
lighting conditions from complete darkness to extreme external brightness.

4. Flagging Comparison Study
This study was conducted on Athelas One (identical to Athelas Home) compared to the
Sysmex XE-5000 to assess the flagging capabilities (distributional and morphological). This
study was performed with 312 patient samples from either capillary whole blood or venous
whole blood collected in K EDTA anticoagulant. Results met the pre-defined acceptance
2
criteria. Summarized data is presented below for both distributional flags as well as
morphological flags.
Distributional Flags
The results of the Athelas One WBC distributional flagging (leukocytosis, leukocytopenia)
compared to the Sysmex XE-5000 were divided into two categories: 1) No flags, negative
judgement and 2) patients with positive distributional abnormalities with flags present,
positive judgement.

%Overall Agreement = 97.12%; 95% CI: 94.59, 98.67
Morphological Flags
The results of the Athelas One WBC morphological flagging (nucleated RBCs, platelet
clumps, etc.) compared to the Sysmex XE-5000 were divided into two categories: 1) No
flags, negative judgement and 2) patients with positive distributional abnormalities with flags
present, positive judgement.
