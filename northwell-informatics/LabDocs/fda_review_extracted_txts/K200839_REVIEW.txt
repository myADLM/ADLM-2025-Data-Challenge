The APAS Independence is intended to be installed with multiple, independent software
(analysis) modules, each of which will provide an assessment of growth for a specific clinical
indication. More than one analysis module may be developed for the same Indication for Use to
allow APAS to assess growth on culture plates from multiple agar manufacturers. In this
application, two independent MRSA analysis modules have been designed to interpret microbial
growth as follows:
• APAS Independence with IC Chromogenic MRSA BD Analysis Module is designed to
interpret microbial growth on BBL CHROMagar MRSA II agar from Becton Dickinson
• APAS Independence with IC Chromogenic MRSA TFS/S Analysis Module is designed
to interpret microbial growth on Remel Spectra MRSA agar from Thermo Fisher
Scientific.
The APAS Independence with the IC Chromogenic MRSA BD and TFS/S Analysis Modules
images and evaluates chromogenic agar plates (BBL CHROMagar MRSA II and Remel Spectra
MRSA, respectively) to determine and report plate results. Each module has its own reporting
scheme (described in Table 2) based on the analytical and clinical performance data and
corresponding risk mitigations.

B Principle of Operation:
APAS Independence when using a MRSA analysis module is designed to detect the presence or
absence of presumptive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) growth on
chromogenic MRSA agar plates. No quantification of growth is required since it is not used to
inform clinical decisions. The system comprises an imaging station to capture images of
chromogenic MRSA agar plates and a plate handling system that moves plates between the input
carriers, imaging station and output carriers or stacks. The software conducts analysis of the
images, assessment of microbial colonies (if present), and result designation.
The APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules is indicated for screening MRSA
chromogenic agar plates (BBL CHROMagar MRSA II and Remel Spectra MRSA) inoculated
with anterior nares swab specimens and incubated for 24 hours. The system takes digital images
of each plate that are analyzed automatically to determine if presumptive MRSA colonies are
present. For each plate, the APAS Independence performs the following tasks:
a. digitally combines several images of the plate for analysis,
b. categorizes each pixel of the image according to the visually different areas on the plate
(e.g., type of growth or agar background),
c. determines how pixels are arranged in relation to each other (e.g., clumps of related
pixels may represent a colony),
d. counts the number of colonies per colony type (although colony counts are not reported
in the MRSA Analysis Modules),
e. differentiates between MRSA and non-MRSA colony types and reports presumptive
results accordingly,
f. incorporates data from the Laboratory Information System (LIS) to provide a final report;
when applicable based on clinical context (“flagged”), a “negative” result may be
modified to “presumptive MRSA growth” to alert the microbiologist that further
investigation may be warranted.
When using the IC MRSA Chromogenic BD Analysis module (BD module), all plates with
presumptive MRSA growth are designated for review by a trained microbiologist for
determination of status and follow up testing according to conventional laboratory practice.
Plates with presumptive non-MRSA growth or no growth are not designated for review and may
be discarded according to the standard operating procedures of the laboratory.
When using the IC MRSA Chromogenic TFS/S Analysis module (TFS/S module), all plates with
presumptive MRSA growth or presumptive non-MRSA growth are designated for review by a
trained microbiologist for determination of status and follow up testing according to
conventional laboratory practice. Plates with no growth are not designated for review and may be
discarded according to the standard operating procedures of the laboratory.

1. Instrument Name:
APAS Independence
2. Specimen Identification:
Plates are identified using an integrated barcode scanner within the Imaging Module of the
APAS Independence. The identity of each plate is displayed on the results screen and
transmitted automatically to the LIS.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The operator loads carriers containing culture plates into the Input Module of the APAS
Independence from which they are moved automatically, one plate at a time, to the Imaging
Module where the barcode is read, the lid is removed, and images of the agar surface are
captured. Upon completion of image capture and analysis, the plate lid is replaced, and the
system automatically sorts each plate based on its designation into the appropriate carrier in
the Output Module.
4. Calibration:
The APAS Independence requires daily color calibration prior to analysis of culture plates.
Calibration is performed using the Color Check Tool provided with the instrument, a
multicolored disk for checking and correcting color of the system optics. Instruction for the
daily Color Check is included in the APAS Independence User Manual. In the event of a
Color Check failure, the check should be repeated. If the repeated failure occurs, the
instrument should not be used until it has been serviced.
5. Quality Control:
After daily calibration (Color Check), a System Check must be performed followed by
biological Quality Control testing.
The System Check Tool comprises a pair of disks with small dots replicating colonies for
checking overall system functionality and associated software. Instruction for daily System
Check is provided in the User Manual for the APAS Independence.
Daily biological Quality Control testing is performed using a reference culture plate
inoculated with a MRSA positive strain (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300).
Instructions for testing is provided in the User Manuals for the APAS Independence with IC
MRSA Chromogenic BD Analysis Module and APAS Independence with IC MRSA
Chromogenic TFS/S Analysis Module.
In the event of a System Check or Quality Control testing failure, the check/testing should be
repeated. If the repeated failure occurs, the instrument should not be used until it has been
serviced. In the event of a System Check fail, the instrument should be locked to prevent
processing of additional culture plates until service has been performed.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility
The reproducibility of presumptive MRSA and non-presumptive MRSA colony detection by
the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules was evaluated with three
instruments. Saline was used to evaluate no growth, three dilutions of two MRSA strains
(MRSA3 and MRSA9) were used to evaluate presumptive MRSA growth (i.e., mainly
confluent, partial confluent, and single colony growth), and three dilutions of two S.
haemolyticus strains (SH3 and SH6) were used to evaluate non-presumptive MRSA growth
(i.e., mainly confluent, partial confluent, and single colony growth) on BD and TFS/S
chromogenic agar plates. Each dilution was plated in triplicate and incubated at 35°C 2 ±°C
for 24 hours. Five replicate images of each plate were taken at three different orientations
(0°, 120° and 270°) on three instruments for a total of 135 images per dilution (3 replicate
plates x 5 replicate images x 3 orientations x 3 instruments = 135 images per dilution).
Results of the reproducibility study with the BD and TFS/S MRSA analysis modules are
shown in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively. The results demonstrate that the reproducibility
between instruments is acceptable.

Accuracy
The accuracy in which the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules is able to
correctly assign “presumptive MRSA” and “presumptive non- MRSA” colonies was
evaluated with a range of organisms noted in Table 4. Organisms were serially diluted in
saline and streaked onto BBL CHROMagar MRSA II (BD) and Remel Spectra MRSA
(TFS/S) chromogenic agar plates in 2 replicates or 7 replicates to produce either light or
confluent growth, respectively, after 24-hour incubation at 36°C ±1°C. At least 100 isolated
colonies per plate were digitally labelled by a microbiologist and compared to the
corresponding APAS result.
Results of the accuracy study with the BD and TFS/S analysis modules are shown in Table 7
and Table 8, respectively. The results demonstrate that the APAS Independence can
accurately detect presumptive MRSA colonies when grown on BD or TFS/S chromogenic
agar plates. However, it cannot accurately detect presumptive non-MRSA colonies. This
reduced specificity is acceptable since plates with “no growth” or “presumptive non-MRSA
growth” do not pose a risk for patient management and are therefore discarded.

Digital Image Quality Study
A Digital Image Quality study was performed to evaluate the accuracy of microbiologist’s
interpretation of a digital image compared to reading the agar plate manually (visual read).
The data generated in this study were analyzed in two different ways: microbiologist
interpretation of a digital image compared to a manual plate read (Table 9-Table 15) and
reproducibility of microbiologists’ interpretation of a digital image read (Table 16).
a) Microbiologist interpretation of APAS-generated digital image compared to manual
plate read
The purpose of this study was to assess whether an APAS-generated digital image of a
chromogenic agar plate read by a microbiologist can be interpreted equivalent to a
manual reading of the chromogenic agar plate (i.e., manual plate read). Three hundred
clinical samples (received as swabs and cultured on appropriate agar plates for routine
MRSA surveillance) and 100 contrived samples were evaluated. Contrived samples were
diluted such that two dilutions were evaluated: medium growth (100-250 CFU/plate) and
low growth (1-50 CFU/plate). A panel of three microbiologists blindly interpreted all 400
agar plates and the corresponding 400 digital images that were randomized after a two
week “wash out” period to avoid any potential for bias based on prior readings.
A summary of the results with the BD and TFS/S analysis modules is provided in Table
9. Data shown by each microbiologist are provided in Table 10, Table 11 and Table 12
for the BD analysis module as well as in Table 13, Table 14 and Table 15 for the TFS/S
analysis module.

1Percent agreement determined by dividing number of digital image read results by the number of manual plate read
results from the same microbiologist for each designation (i.e., “no growth”, “presumptive non-MRSA growth”,
“presumptive MRSA growth”).
The digital image quality study determined that an APAS-generated digital image using
the BD module can be equivalently interpreted by a microbiologist compared to reading
the plate manually (visual read). This was achieved >95% of the time for each of the
three result designations. Importantly, MRSA growth agreement was >95%, which is
acceptable to support use of a two-rule designation set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth
and negative) in that only plates with presumptive MRSA growth are required for
microbiologist review.

The digital image quality study determined that an APAS-generated digital image using
the TFS/S module cannot be equivalently interpreted by a microbiologist compared to
reading the plate manually. Agreement was <95% of the time for each result designation.
Importantly, presumptive MRSA growth agreement was 93.5%, which is not acceptable
to support use of a two-rule designation set. As such, the TFS/S module will use a three-
rule designation set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth, presumptive non-MRSA growth,
and negative) in that plates with any growth (presumptive MRSA or presumptive non-
MRSA) are required for microbiologist review.

b) Reproducibility of the APAS-generated digital image interpretation
The data obtained from the digital image quality study was further analyzed to evaluate
the ability of an APAS-generated digital image to be reproducibly interpreted by a panel
of microbiologists. Here, each microbiologist’s interpretation of a digital image was
compared to the final panel interpretation of the digital image (i.e., majority result). The
study determined that a digital image generated with both the BD and TFS/S analysis
modules can be reproducibly interpreted by a microbiologist. This was achieved >95% of
the time for each of the three result designations (summarized in Table 16), which is
acceptable.

Microbial Interference
A study was conducted to assess the ability of APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis
Modules to accurately detect MRSA in the presence of non-MRSA growth within the
recommended incubation time for each respective plate (i.e., 20 – 26 hours for BD and 24
hours for TFS/S chromogenic agar plates).
Two MRSA (MRSA3 and MRSA5) isolates and two non-MRSA (Staphylococcus
haemolyticus, SH6 and Staphylococcus warneri, STSP4) organisms were prepared as pure
and mixed cultures and diluted accordingly to produce culture plates with mainly confluent
growth (>100 colonies per plate) or light growth (1 – 100 colonies per plate) in five
replicates. After 24 hours of incubation, a panel of three microbiologists evaluated the
presence or absence of growth and color indicative of MRSA. The majority panel result (i.e.,
final panel interpretation) was compared to the APAS result to determine agreement for
growth and color.
The data provided in Table 17 and Table 18 supports interpretation of the BD and TFS/S
chromogenic agar plates after 24 hours of incubation.

Analytical Specificity / Limit of Blank
A study was conducted to evaluate the potential influence of various external factors on
image quality and the ability of the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules to
provide correct results in the presence of known factors. Chromogenic agar plates (BD or
TFS/S) were prepared to concurrently simulate a combination of four interference
mechanisms (label, applicator, transport media and pen marking). Three blank applicators
(flocked swab, cotton swab and 10 µL loop) were used to inoculate chromogenic agar plates
using three different transport media (Stuart Transport, Amies Transport and saline) and no
transport media (dry). One of four different labels were applied to plates that were either
marked with felt-tip pen or not (3 applicators x 4 transport media x 4 labels x 2 marks = 96
plates per chromogenic agar). Although each interference mechanism was evaluated
concurrently (i.e., four variables evaluated on each plate), performance is stratified by each
interference variable in Table 19.

In general, the interference variables did interfere with the ability of the APAS Independence
with MRSA Analysis Modules to provide accurate “no growth” result, which may produce
false positives growth. However, since BD plates with “presumptive MRSA growth” and
TFS/S plates with “presumptive MRSA growth” and “presumptive non-MRSA growth” are
reviewed by microbiologists before confirmatory testing, the risk for an erroneous result
being reported for patient management is mitigated by the review. In addition, plates with
“no growth” or “presumptive non-MRSA growth” do not pose a risk for patient management
and are therefore discarded.
Analytical Specificity / Interference
The ability in which the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules can accurately
detect presumptive MRSA and presumptive non-MRSA colonies in the presence of known
interferences was evaluated. Three applicators (flocked swab, cotton swab and 10 µL loop)
were used to inoculate chromogenic agar plates using two different media (Stuart Transport
and Amies Transport). Plates were labelled with one of four different labels applied to the
base or side of the plate that were either marked with felt-tip pen or not (3 applicators x 2
media x 4 labels x 2 marks = 48 plates per organism, per chromogenic agar). One MRSA
(MRSA3) and one non-MRSA (S. haemolyticus, SH6) isolate were prepared to a 0.5
McFarland suspension and diluted accordingly to produce predominantly isolated colonies or
heavy growth, respectively, when cultured. Plates were incubated at 36°C ±1°C for 24 hours
then imaged. Performance is summarized in Table 20.

2 Value calculated by dividing the number of images with the expected growth (i.e., growth detected or no growth detected) by the total
number of images.
3 Value calculated by dividing the number of images with the expected color (i.e., no color detected) by the total number of images.
In general, the interference variables tested had no impact on the ability of the BD and TFS/S
MRSA Analysis Modules to detect presumptive MRSA growth (100% detection). False
positive results were obtained with the S. haemolyticus samples; however, the risk of false
positive results is mitigated since all plates with “presumptive MRSA growth” are reviewed
by a microbiologist prior to confirmatory testing.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The device labeling indicates that the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Module
requires daily color calibration and a System Check using dedicated tools provided with the
instrument. In addition, daily biological Quality Control testing must be performed using
reference culture plates inoculated with a MRSA positive strain (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus
ATCC 43300). In order to pass, results from the culture media must meet the expected
designation (i.e., “presumptive MRSA growth”). There were 22 QC plates tested during the
clinical study and 8 QC plates tested during the analytical studies. All QC results passed each
day of testing with both the BD and TFS/S MRSA analysis modules.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Detection
A study was conducted to determine the smallest colony size that can be detected by the
APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules. The effect of colony size on the ability
of APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules to detect presumptive MRSA
colonies was evaluated. Two strains of MRSA (MRSA3 and MRSA9) used to evaluate
presumptive MRSA growth were prepared as 0.5 McFarland suspensions in saline, diluted
and plated in six replicates to grow < 100 colonies per plate. Plates were incubated at 36°C
±1°C until pinpoint colonies were observed. Then, plates were imaged and returned to the
incubator at 1-hour intervals until the colonies on the plates were approximately 2 mm in
diameter (up to 24 hours).
Table 21 summarizes the percent of colonies detected by APAS by colony size (pixels and
extrapolated mm). The smallest colony size (SCZ) that was detected as presumptive MRSA
>95% was determined to be the LoD. The SCZ detected by the BD analysis module was
0.815 mm for MRSA3 and 0.906 mm for MRSA9. The SCZ detected by the TFS/S analysis
module was 0.634 mm for MRSA3 and 0.543 mm for MRSA 9.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules was
evaluated in a two-part study. The overall data from both parts were used collectively in the
evaluation of performance.
For part 1 of the clinical study, the goal was to evaluate performance of the APAS
Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules by inoculating prospective and contrived
clinical samples onto chromogenic agar media and comparing APAS-generated results to a
panel (i.e., majority) result. This part of the study was performed at a single clinical site
(outside United States, oUS) using remnant swab specimens that were leftover from routine,
standard of care testing from various healthcare facilities. Each swab specimen was subjected
to PCR testing for the detection of MRSA. Positive PCR samples were sent to a confirmatory
lab for culture. Both positive and negative PCR samples were inoculated onto chromogenic
agar and shipped to a central laboratory for incubation and imaging. A portion of PCR-
negative samples were also used to generate contrived-negative and contrived-positive
samples to supplement the study. The on-screen (digital) images were interpreted by a panel
of three oUS microbiologists. The majority result was considered the truth state (i.e., final
panel interpretation) and used as a comparison to the APAS-generated result.
For part 2 of the clinical study, the goal was to assess the ability of a panel of three US
microbiologists to interpret the same set of randomized digital images already acquired and
reported in part 1. The microbiologists were blinded to the other interpretations and plate
source (clinical or contrived). The majority result was compared to the historical APAS result
obtained in the first part of the study.
The following 1590 samples were enrolled in the clinical study:
• 1100 PCR-negative clinical samples
• 25 PCR-positive clinical samples
• 60 PCR-negative, contrived-negative samples
• 405 PCR-negative, contrived-positive samples
K200839 - Page 23 of 30

--- Page 24 ---
Thirteen samples were excluded from the BD analysis due to defects in the agar resulting in a
total of 1573 BD plates analyzed. Ten samples were excluded from the TFS/S analysis due to
defects in the agar, resulting in a total of 1580 TFS/S plates analyzed.
Contrived samples were used due to the low incidence of MRSA in the population. This was
acceptable since the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules only images and
interprets microbial colonies (i.e., it is not a selective and differential medium). Leftover
PCR-negative swab specimens were spiked (1 – 10,000 CFU/plate) with MRSA organisms
known to produce a positive reaction on the agar (“presumptive MRSA growth”) or
organisms known to grow on the agar but not produce a positive reaction (“presumptive non-
MRSA growth”). Some organisms included in the contrived samples are representative of the
most common strains from the US, Europe, United King and Australia (Table 22). The other
contrived samples were spiked with well-characterized stock clinical isolates obtained by
LBT Innovations and identification confirmed using MALDI-TOF with methicillin
susceptibility/resistance confirmed using well-accepted methods (i.e., oxacillin MIC assay
using an FDA-cleared device or cefoxitin disk diffusion assay).

Part 1 Clinical Study
Performance of the APAS Independence with MRSA Analysis Modules for the first part of the clinical study (i.e., oUS site) is shown in Table 23
(clinical samples), Table 24 (contrived samples), and Table 25 (clinical and contrived samples combined). The overall agreement of the BD MRSA
analysis module (when evaluating combined samples) is 82.6% for “no growth” detection, 84.6% for “presumptive non-MRSA growth”, and 100%
for “presumptive MRSA growth”. The overall agreement of the TFS/S MRSA analysis module (when evaluating clinical and contrived samples,
combined) is 81.8% for “no growth” detection, 83.8% for “presumptive non-MRSA growth”, and 99.2% for “presumptive MRSA growth”.

An analysis was conducted to assess concordance of results between part 1 and part 2 of the clinical study. As shown in Table 29, the combined
data from part 1 (oUS) was used as the comparator for the combined data from part 2 (US). The overall agreement of the BD MRSA analysis
module is 98.6% for “no growth” detection, 94.8% for “presumptive non-MRSA growth”, and 99.2% for “presumptive MRSA growth”. The
overall agreement of the TFS/S MRSA analysis module is 99.1% for “no growth” detection, 94.5% for “presumptive non-MRSA growth”, and
90.6% for “presumptive MRSA growth”.

Overall Performance of the APAS Independence with the MRSA Analysis Modules
The overall performances for the BD MRSA and TFS/S MRSA analysis modules were evaluated to determine the possible claims that could be
supported and how performance issues could be mitigated. As a result, considering data and supportive metrics from other studies, it was concluded
that either a two-designation rule set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth and negative) or a three-designation rule set (i.e., presumptive MRSA
growth, presumptive non-MRSA growth, and negative) would be appropriate.
a) Overall Performance of the APAS Independence with the BD MRSA Analysis Modules
The overall performance of the BD MRSA analysis modules for detection of presumptive MRSA growth (both in the analytical studies and
clinical study) is acceptable to support a two-designation rule set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth and negative). As such, only plates with
“presumptive MRSA growth” require review by a microbiologist. The acceptability of the two-designation rule set is based on the following
performance metrics:
• >95% agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” in the digital image quality study (Table 9)
• >98% agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” in part 1 (Table 25) and part 2 clinical data (Table 28)
• >95% agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” when comparing part 1 and part 2 clinical data (Table 29)

b) Overall Performance of the APAS Independence with the TFS/S MRSA Analysis Modules
The overall performance of the TFS/S MRSA analysis modules for detection of
presumptive MRSA growth (both in the analytical studies and clinical study) is
acceptable to support a three-designation rule set (i.e., presumptive MRSA growth,
presumptive non-MRSA growth, and negative). As such, all plates with growth
(“presumptive MRSA growth” or “presumptive non-MRSA growth) require review by a
microbiologist. The acceptability of the three-designation rule set is based on the
following performance metrics:
• <95% agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” in the digital image quality
study (Table 9)
• >98% agreement for “presumptive MRSA growth” in part 1 (Table 25) and part 2
clinical data (Table 28)
