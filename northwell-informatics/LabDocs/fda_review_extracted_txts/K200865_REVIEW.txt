IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Piccolo® Potassium Test System is a single-use, disposable system used with the Piccolo
Xpress® chemistry analyzer for the in vitro quantitative determination of potassium in lithium
heparinized whole blood, lithium heparinized plasma, or serum in a clinical laboratory setting or
point-of-care location. The Piccolo® Potassium Test System consists of the Piccolo Xpress®
chemistry analyzer and the dry reagent for the detection of potassium which is contained in a
single-use disposable reagent discs designed to separate a lithium heparinized whole blood
sample into plasma and blood cells. The disc meters the required quantity of plasma and diluent,
mixes the plasma with diluent, and delivers the mixture to the reaction cuvettes along the disc
perimeter. The diluted plasma mixes with the lyophilized microsphere reagent beads contained in
the cuvettes, initiating the chemical reactions that are then monitored by the analyzer.
Alternatively, the disc may also be used with serum. The Piccolo® Potassium Test System dry
reagent contains pyruvate kinase (0.01 U), lactate dehydrogenase (0.27 U), adenosine
diphosphate (36 µg), phosphoenolpyruvate (57 µg) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (48
µg).
All performance studies for the Piccolo® Potassium Test System in this submission were
conducted on the Piccolo Xpress® Chemistry Analyzer using the Piccolo® Comprehensive
Metabolic Panel (CMP) disc. The potassium test included in the Piccolo® CMP disc is
representative for the potassium assay found in all currently marketed Piccolo reagent discs that
include the potassium assay.

B Principle of Operation:
The principle of operation of the Piccolo® Potassium Test is based on an enzymatic method with
photometric detection. In the coupled-enzyme reaction, pyruvate kinase (PK) dephosphorylates
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form pyruvate. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzes
conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Concomitantly, NADH is oxidized to NAD+. The rate of
change in absorbance difference between 340 nm and 405 nm is due to the conversion of NADH
to NAD+ and is directly proportional to the amount of potassium in the sample.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision
Precision was evaluated at a point-of-care (POC) site using two levels of control (target
values of 3.1 and 6.1 mmol/L) and two pooled plasma samples (approximate values of 3.2
and 5.4 mmol/L). The operators each tested these samples in five replicates on three Piccolo
Xpress® chemistry analyzers over five days. One lot of CMP reagent discs was used. The
total number of replicates was 75 per sample. The results are shown below:

Whole Blood Precision
Whole blood precision was tested at a POC site by two operators with one lot of CMP
reagent discs using four fresh, lithium heparin venous whole blood samples on four Piccolo
Xpress® chemistry analyzers with 16 replicates per sample. The study design for this
precision study included repeatability, between-analyzer, and between-operator components.
The design considered the one-hour limit for testing of potassium in whole blood samples on
this device. The results are shown below:

2. Linearity:
Whole Blood
A linearity study was performed on three Piccolo Xpress® Chemistry Analyzers using one
CMP reagent disc lot. To provide elevated concentrations of potassium in whole blood,
individual lithium heparinized whole blood samples were enriched by the addition of a
concentrated plasma with a concentration of 48.9 mmol/L potassium. A human, potassium
free plasma pool was prepared by exhaustive dialysis against physiological saline containing
lithium heparin. To provide low concentrations of potassium in whole blood, individual
lithium heparinized whole blood samples were diluted with this potassium free plasma.
Nineteen levels of potassium were prepared resulting in a panel with concentrations targeted
at 1.2, 1.4, 1.9, 2.3, 3.0, 3.4, 3.9, 4.9, 5.6, 6.1, 6.9, 7.6, 7.8, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 9.1 and 9.5 mmol/L.
Each sample was assayed in singlicate on three (3) Piccolo Xpress® chemistry analyzers to
ensure that the recoveries were not instrument-specific (i.e., each sample was tested in
triplicate). Samples were then processed to plasma and measured in triplicate by the Siemens
VISTA integrated system (VISTA ISE) K+ method (k051087) at a central reference
laboratory. Expected values were calculated and then predicted values were calculated using
a weighted least squares linear regression analysis and the average of the triplicate
measurements. The deviation from linearity was within ±0.5mmol/L. In addition, an
assessment of the systematic difference between the candidate device whole blood values and

Plasma
Immediately after the venous whole blood was tested as described above, it was centrifuged
to obtain plasma. Each plasma sample was assayed in singlicate on three Piccolo Xpress®
chemistry analyzers to ensure that the recoveries were not instrument-specific (i.e., each
sample was tested in triplicate). The target concentrations of the samples were the same as in
the whole blood linearity study. The plasma samples were also measured at a central
reference laboratory by the Siemens VISTA integrated system (VISTA ISE) K+ method in
triplicate. Expected values were calculated and then predicted values were calculated using a
weighted least squares linear regression analysis and the average of the triplicate
measurements. The deviation from linearity was within 0.5mmol/L. In addition, an
assessment of the systematic difference between the candidate device plasma values and the
Siemens VISTA ISE plasma values by Deming regression was performed. Results of the

Serum
A serum linearity study was performed using samples prepared by exhaustive dialysis against
physiological saline. A serum concentrate was prepared by addition of KCl to a serum pool
to provide a final concentration of 51.0 mmol/L. The potassium free serum pool was
supplemented with this potassium concentrate to provide a high pool with a target value of
9.5 mmol/L. A low potassium pool was prepared in a similar manner to provide a pool with a
target value of 1.2 mmol/L. Admixtures of this high potassium pool were made into the low
pool to provide the following 14 levels of potassium, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, 3.1, 3.6, 4.3, 4.9, 5.6, 6.3,
6.9, 7.6, 8.2, 8.8 and 9.5 mmol/L as determined at a central reference lab by the Siemens
VISTA integrated system (VISTA ISE) K+ method, results run in triplicate. Each serum
sample was assayed in singlicate on three (3) Piccolo Xpress® chemistry analyzers to ensure
that the recoveries were not instrument-specific (i.e., each sample was tested in triplicate).
Expected values were calculated and then predicted values were calculated using a weighted
least squares linear regression analysis and the average of the triplicate measurements. The
deviation from linearity was within 0.5mmol/L. In addition, an assessment of the systematic
difference between the candidate device serum values and the Siemens VISTA ISE serum
values by Deming regression was performed. Results of the regression analysis are presented
below:

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The Analytical Specificity/Interference was established in K992140.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
1.5 – 8.5 mmol/L
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
Every Potassium reagent bead set is calibrated against plasma samples with assigned values
by the Siemens VISTA ISE K+ method and all three (3) levels of NIST SRM 956d.
Secondary standards and controls are tested on every lot of reagent discs during processing
and final testing.
Sample Stability
Whole blood venipuncture sample stability was established in K992140. Whole blood
venipuncture samples should be run within 60 minutes of collection.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) of the Piccolo® Potassium Test System was evaluated on the
Piccolo Xpress® chemistry analyzer using venous whole blood, plasma and serum prepared
by taking a native blood sample of known potassium concentration and diluting it to four
target concentrations using dialyzed (potassium free) serum/plasma as the diluent. The
sponsor defines LoQ as the lowest measurable concentration (in mmol/L) that can be
measured with respect to the predefined accuracy goal, in this case total error of +0.5
mmol/L. Each sample level was tested in replicates of five using two CMP reagent disc lots.
Ten analyzers were used for whole blood testing, five per disc lot. Four analyzers were used
for serum and plasma testing. Sixty low level sample replicates per lot were generated. The
LoQ for whole blood, plasma, and serum on the Piccolo® Potassium Test System was
determined to be 1.5 mmol/L.

At the first site, one hundred and seventy-eight (178) venous whole blood samples were
drawn into lithium heparinized tubes and immediately tested for potassium with the
candidate device. Immediately after testing, the same tube was centrifuged to plasma by
standard laboratory techniques and tested. A separate serum tube (SST) was also drawn,
allowed to coagulate, and processed to serum then tested. Testing was performed by three
intended operators using seven Piccolo Xpress® chemistry analyzers and one reagent lot of
the Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) reagent disc. A total of 16 samples (9%) in the
extreme high and low ranges were contrived to cover the entire measuring range. After
testing with the candidate device, the plasma samples and serum samples were aliquoted,
frozen, and shipped to a central reference laboratory for comparator testing by the Siemens
VISTA integrated system (VISTA ISE) K+ method cleared by FDA in k051087. Data was
analyzed using Deming regression. The average of the Siemens VISTA ISE potassium values
was used as the x-axis and the individual candidate device values were used as the y-axis in
the regression analysis.

were contrived to cover the entire measuring range. After the initial testing, the whole blood
was processed to plasma, frozen, and shipped to a central reference laboratory for duplicate
testing by the Siemens VISTA integrated system (VISTA ISE) K+ method cleared by FDA
in k051087. Data was analyzed using Deming regression. The average of the Siemens
