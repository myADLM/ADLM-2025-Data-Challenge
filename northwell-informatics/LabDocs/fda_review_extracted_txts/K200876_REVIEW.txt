C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For both the Dexcom G6 System and the Dexcom Glucose Program System:
• Remove the Dexcom G6 sensor, transmitter, and receiver before Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat
(diathermy) treatment. The magnetic fields and heat could damage the components of the
Dexcom G6 System, which may cause it to display inaccurate blood glucose readings or
may prevent alerts.
• When wearing the device, ask for hand-wanding or full-body pat-down and visual
inspection instead of going through the Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) body
scanner. Also avoid putting any part of the device through baggage x-ray machine.
• This device is not intended for pregnant women, people on dialysis, or critically ill
patients.
• The device should not be used to make diabetes treatment decisions when
The user has not used the iCGM before or is unfamiliar with the Dexcom G6
o
System. (It may take days, weeks or months for a user to gain confidence in using
the iCGM to make treatment decisions.)
The user’s symptoms do not match the glucose values displayed by the device.
o
The device does not show a glucose value or a trend arrow.
o
During the first two hours of sensor warm-up period, the user should use a blood
o
glucose meter to make treatment decisions.
• Although standard dosing of acetaminophen (1000 mg per every 6 hours) does not appear
to cause significant bias, higher supra-therapeutic levels of acetaminophen have shown
significant positive bias.
• Sensor glucose readings will be falsely higher if the user is taking hydroxyurea. Do not
use your Dexcom CGM System for diabetes treatment decisions if you are taking
hydroxyurea.
• Adult users should only use the abdomen and pediatric users should only use the buttock
or abdomen. Sensor performance has not been evaluated in other insertion sites and may
differ from expected iCGM performance.
• If a sensor wire breaks or detaches from the sensor, it could remain under the user’s skin.
The user should contact their healthcare practitioner if this occurs.
• The transmitter should not be shared to avoid transmission of bloodborne illnesses.
• When using the smart device as a receiver, the user should follow the user manual
instructions to ensure that all glucose values, important alarms and alerts can be seen and
heard. Do not use headphones will using the smart device as a receiver. The app must
always be running in the background of the smart device to ensure the user receives
glucose values, alarms and alerts.
• Before updating the smart device hardware or operating system, verify the compatibility
of the updated hardware/software with the device system.
For the Dexcom Glucose Program System Only:
• The Dexcom Glucose Program System does not alert or alarm the user when the glucose
is low (below the target range), high (above the target range), or rapidly changing. Users
should check readings often if they need to know their glucose level.

Not applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
DEXCOM G6 CONTINOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM (called the DEXCOM G6
SYSTEM hereafter)
The Dexcom G6 System in an integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) that
provides continuous glucose readings which are updated every 5 minutes providing glucose
levels, trends, and alerts. The System consists of three main components: a sensor, a Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE) transmitter and a BLE enabled display device (receiver and/or mobile
application). The user can view glucose data on the receiver or on the G6 CGM App (i.e., a
mobile medical application) running on a compatible mobile device, or on both simultaneously.
The system provides alerts and alarms which warn the user of low or impending low and high or
impending high glucose levels. The user may determine their treatment based on the glucose
values provided by the system.
G6 CGM Sensor
The sensor component is a sterile device that consists of the sensor applicator,
plastic base (“transmitter holder”), and sensor probe. The applicator is a single use, disposable
unit that contains an introducer needle holding the sensor probe. The applicator deploys the
needle and inserts the sensor under the skin. The needle is retracted back into the applicator after
insertion. The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and
can be worn for up to 10 days.
The sensor may be worn in the abdomen for adults, and both the abdomen and buttock for
children ages 2-17 years old. Sensor comes with a calibration code that the user enters into the
system upon initializing a new sensor. Once the code is applied, the user does not need to
calibrate the system throughout the entirety of the sensor lifetime, which is 10 days. However,
the user has the option to manually calibrate the system using self-measurements from a blood
glucose meter in addition to entering the calibration code. Alternatively, if the user chooses not
to enter the calibration code, he or she must manually calibrate the sensor by entering two
fingerstick blood glucose values during start up and every 24 hours thereafter.
G6 CGM Transmitter
The G6 CGM Transmitter is a miniature radio transmitter that incorporates data
processing functionality. The transmitter contains a Bluetooth radio transceiver for
communication with a compatible display device (i.e., receiver and/or smart device).
The transmitter attaches to the sensor and can be re-used for multiple sensing sessions
up to three months.
K200876 - Page 4 of 28

--- Page 5 ---
G6 CGM Receiver
The G6 CGM Receiver is small hand-held device that wirelessly receives glucose information
from the transmitter every five minutes and includes a touchscreen display. The receiver displays
the current glucose reading and glucose trends to the user. It alerts the user when glucose levels
are outside of a target zone and when other important system conditions occur.
Dexcom G6 System Mobile App
The G6 CGM App for iOS and G6 CGM App for Android provides an alternative display device
to the receiver for users with a compatible, BLE-enabled smart device and behaves similarly to
the receiver. The G6 CGM App is compatible with certain iOS, Android and Smart Device
watches. The G6 CGM App for Android now includes a mechanism to ensure that mobile device
operating system settings for Do Not Disturb cannot prevent the user from receiving auditory
Urgent Low Glucose Alarms; this safety risk was present in previous versions of the Dexcom G6
Android Mobile App. A link to a list of compatible devices is included in the instructions for
use.
The Dexcom G6 System is an interoperable connected device that can communicate glucose
readings and other information wirelessly and securely to and from interoperable electronic
interfaces; including compatible AID systems. The G6 CGM system is designed to communicate
with interoperable devices in several ways, such as described below:
• Wireless communication from the transmitter directly to an interoperable device
communicating through the same protocol.
• The app communicates to another app on a single mobile platform.
• The app communicates through the cloud to another software device.
DEXCOM G6 GLUCOSE PROGRAM CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM
(called the DEXCOM GLUCOSE PROGRAM SYSTEM hereafter)
The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program System is an integrated continuous glucose monitoring
system (iCGM) that provides continuous glucose readings which are updated every 5 minutes
providing glucose levels and trends. The System consists of three main components: a sensor, a
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitter and a BLE enabled display device (receiver and/or
mobile application). A user must use the Dexcom G6 Glucose Program App (i.e., a mobile
medical application) running on a compatible mobile device in order to view glucose data.
G6 Glucose Program CGM Sensor
The sensor component is a sterile device that consists of the sensor applicator, plastic base
(“transmitter holder”), and sensor probe. The applicator is a single use, disposable unit that
contains an introducer needle holding the sensor probe. The applicator deploys the needle and
inserts the sensor under the skin. The needle is retracted back into the applicator after insertion.
The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and can be
worn for up to 10 days.
The sensor may be worn in the abdomen for adults, and both the abdomen and buttock for
children ages 2-17 years old.
K200876 - Page 5 of 28

--- Page 6 ---
G6 Glucose Program Transmitter
The transmitter component is a miniature radio transmitter that incorporates data processing
functionality. The transmitter contains a Bluetooth radio transceiver for communication with a
compatible display device (i.e., mobile device). The transmitter attaches to the sensor and can be
re-used for multiple sensing sessions up to three months.
G6 Glucose Program Mobile App
The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program CGM App for Android is the primary display for the system.
The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program CGM App is compatible with specific Android devices. A
link to a list of compatible devices is included in the instructions for use.
The Dexcom G6 Glucose Program CGM System is an interoperable connected device that can
communicate glucose readings and other information wirelessly and securely to and from
interoperable electronic interfaces. The G6 Glucose Program CGM system is designed to
communicate with interoperable devices in several ways, such as described below:
• Wireless communication from the transmitter directly to an interoperable device
communicating through the same protocol.
• The app communicates to another app on a single mobile platform.
• The app communicates through the cloud to another software device.
B Principle of Operation:
The Dexcom G6 System and Dexcom Glucose Program System detect glucose levels from the
fluid just beneath the skin (interstitial fluid). The sensor probe continuously measures glucose
concentration in the interstitial fluid via an enzymatic electrochemical reaction using glucose
oxidase. The enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and produces
hydrogen peroxide. The production of hydrogen peroxide generates an electrical current that is
proportionate to the interstitial glucose concentration. The transmitter converts the signal using
an algorithm to a glucose value read in mg/dL, which is then transmitted to the receiver/mobile
application for the user to see and use accordingly.

Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System
Dexcom G6 Glucose Program Continuous Glucose Monitoring System
2. Specimen Identification:
Not applicable.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not applicable.
4. Calibration:
Though the Dexcom G6 System and the Dexcom Glucose Program System do not require
user calibration. Users have the option to calibrate the device manually (e.g., in situations
where users do not have to use the calibration code). Therefore, a calibration stability
evaluation was completed to demonstrate that the system could be calibrated manually
without impact to system performance. Subjects were instructed to calibrate their CGM
K200876 - Page 6 of 28

--- Page 7 ---
devices according to the explicit system requirements. Beginning two hours after sensor
insertion, calibration prompts were provided on the receiver twice the first day and every 24
hours for the remainder of the study. To demonstrate the performance of the System over a
calibration cycle, the CGM-laboratory comparator percentage agreement was evaluated in 4-
hour increments after calibration. Results were similar to the results obtained using the
factory calibration codes.
5. Quality Control:
Not applicable.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
The optimized joint probability algorithm in the modified Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose
Monitoring System and the Dexcom G6 Glucose Program Continuous Glucose Monitoring
System was developed independently from the clinical validation dataset. Because the two
systems use the same modified glucose algorithm, the following sections represent the
performance for both Systems. iCGM performance was previously evaluated in clinical studies
described in DEN170088. The raw data was reprocessed using the updated algorithm in
K200876.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
iCGM performance was evaluated in clinical studies described in Section C(3) below. A
subset of randomly selected subjects (n=67) wore two devices concurrently (blinded and
unblinded iCGM Systems) at the same sensor insertion site (two in abdomen or two in
buttock) to evaluate the device precision. A table of the sensor site distribution is provided
below.
Another subset of randomly-selected pediatric subjects (n=28) wore one device in the
abdomen and a second device in the buttock concurrently to evaluate agreement of device
measurements between different sensor insertion sites.

2. Linearity:
The reportable range for the System is 40 to 400 mg/dL. Data supporting this claimed
measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3) below.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference was previously assessed in DEN170088 and was not impacted by the algorithm
modifications.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See Linearity section above.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The sensor has a storage shelf-life of 12 months. Shelf life was evaluated at 32⁰-86⁰ F and
10-90% relative humidity. Sensors should be stored at 32⁰-86⁰ F.
The Dexcom G6 CGM System and the Dexcom Glucose Program System transmitters have
sufficient battery life to function for 3 months as intended following its maximum storage
time of 8 months. Shelf life was evaluated at 32⁰-113⁰ F and 10-95% relative humidity.
6. Detection Limit:
If a glucose measurement is less than 40 mg/dL, the result is displayed by the system as ‘Lo’.
If a glucose measurement exceeds 400 mg/dL, result is displayed as ‘Hi’. Data supporting
this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3)
below.

The following sections represent the performance for both the Dexcom G6 CGM System and
the Dexcom G6 Glucose Program System:
Two clinical studies were previously conducted to support the accuracy performance of the
predicate device; See DEN170088 for clinical study details. The clinical study raw data was
reprocessed using the updated algorithm. The pediatric study included one additional subject
following the data reprocessing as a result of the algorithm modifications; the sensor used in
the additional pediatric subject was not declined by the updated algorithm, whereas the
previous algorithm eliminated the sensor before the end-of-life (i.e., 10 days).

Trend Accuracy
Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose
and are characterized by slopes, such as from >2 mg/dL to <-2 mg/dL. Trend accuracy was
assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change (changes in mg/dL of glucose
per minute) determined by the iCGM values and the corresponding comparator values for
each iCGM-comparator measured pairs (typically collected once every 15 minutes).

Agreement When iCGM Reads “LOW” or “HIGH”
The Dexcom G6 System and the Dexcom Glucose Program System report glucose readings
between 40 and 400 mg/dL. When the system determines the glucose reading is below 40
mg/dL, it displays “LOW” in the Receiver or Mobile Application Status Box. When the
system determines that the glucose level is above 400 mg/dL, it displays “HIGH” in the
Receiver or Mobile Application Status Box. Because the System does not display glucose
values below 40 mg/dL or above 400 mg/dL, the comparisons to the actual blood glucose
levels (as determined by the laboratory comparator analyzer) when the iCGM value is

Alert performance:
The Hypoglycemic Alert Rate shows how often the alert is right or wrong. The True
Notification Rate is the % of time the device alarmed when the blood glucose level was at or
below the alert setting within 15 minutes before or after the device alarmed (as confirmed by
the comparator method). The False Notification Rate is the % of time the device alarmed
when the blood glucose level was above the alert setting within 15 minutes before or after the
device alarmed. The Correct Detection Rate is the % of time the device alarmed when the
blood glucose level was at or below the alert setting within 15 minutes before or after the
hypoglycemic event. The Missed Detection Rate is the % of time the device did not alarm
when the blood glucose level was at or below the alert setting within 15 minutes before and
after the hypoglycemic event.

Sensor Stability:
Sensor stability describes the performance over the sensor lifetime. Sensors can be worn for
up to 10 days. Performance was estimated by calculating the percentage of iCGM readings
within 15 mg/dL or 15% (15/15%), 20 mg/dL or 20% (20/20%), and 40 mg/dL or 40%
(40/40%) of the laboratory comparator values at the beginning (Day 1, 2), middle (Day 4, 5),
and end (Day 7, 10) of the System lifecycle. The mean of the absolute relative differences
were evaluated over the 10-day life of the sensor within the measuring range.

Sensor Life:
A total of 374 sensors were evaluated to determine the percentage of sensors that lasted
through the 10 day sensor life. Eighty-four percent (84%) of the sensors lasted through the
end of the entire wear period (e.g., Day 10) (see Figure 1). Among the 374 sensors evaluated,
36 sensors (9.6%) had “early sensor shut-off” where the sensor algorithm would have
detected sensors that did not function as intended and shut them off.

The capture rate characterizes the reliability of the communication between components of
the system. The System provides a sensor glucose reading every 5 minutes, or up to 288
readings per day. The percentage of readings expected to be received from the system over
the sensor life was evaluated from 374 sensors and is 98.6%. More than 97% of the sensors
captured readings at least 90% of the time. The table below describes the percent of readings
received throughout the life span of the sensor (capture rate).
