A Principle of Operation:
Medicon Hellas Albumin:
The bromocresol green (BCG) method is applied, without serum blank. The bi-chromatic
photometric determination of albumin is based on albumin binding the anionic dye bromocresol
green in mildly acidic pH. The increase raise in absorbance at 620/750 nm is proportional to the
concentration of albumin in the sample. The sample volume used for the assay is 2 µL.
Medicon Hellas Calcium:
Calcium ions react with Arsenazo III dye in acidic pH, to form a violet complex. The absorbance
at 650/750 nm is proportional to the concentration of calcium in serum or urine samples. The
analyzer photometer reads the absorbance at time intervals dictated by the method application
stored in the analyzer memory, and the change in absorbance is calculated automatically. The
sample volume used for the assay is 2 µL for serum or urine samples.
Medicon Hellas Creatinine:
Creatinine forms a yellow-orange complex with picrate anions in alkaline medium. The rate of
change of absorbance of the complex at 505/700 nm is proportional to creatinine concentration in
K200898 - Page 4 of 20

--- Page 5 ---
serum or urine samples. The sample volume used for the assay is 22 µL for serum or urine
samples.
Medicon Hellas Glucose (Hexokinase):
The determination of glucose, according to the hexokinase method, is based on the following
reactions, using 2 µL of sample for serum or urine samples.
Hexokinase
Glucose + ATP 6-phosphate glucose + ADP
G-6PDH
6-phosphate glucose + NAD 6-phosphate gluconic acid + NADH
The concentration of glucose is determined bi-chromatically by the absorbance change at
340/380 nm.
Medicon Hellas Direct Bilirubin:
The modified Malloy-Evelyn method is applied on serum samples. Direct (conjugated) bilirubin
reacts with diazotised sulfanilic acid in acidic pH to form azobilirubin, a colored chromophore.
The absorbance of chromophore at 550/650 nm is proportional to the concentration of direct
bilirubin in the sample. The free (unbound) bilirubin fraction does not react. The reaction is an
end-point type. The sample volume used for the assay is 8 µL
Medicon Hellas Total Bilirubin:
The DPD method is applied, whereby 3,5-dichlorophenyldiazonium tetrafluoroborate (DPD)
binds directly to total bilirubin in acidic medium, forming azobilirubin, whose rate of absorbance
at 550/700 nm is proportional to the concentration of total bilirubin in the sample. The analyzer
photometer reads the absorbance at time intervals dictated by the method application stored in
the analyzer memory, and the change in absorbance is calculated automatically. The sample
volume used by the assay is 20 µL.
Medicon Hellas Urea Nitrogen:
Urea Nitrogen is determined according to the following reactions, using 7 µL of sample for
serum and urine samples:
Urease
Urea + H O 2 NH + CO
2 3 2
GLDH
2 NH + + 2-α-Ketoglutarate + 2 NADH 2-L-Glutamate + 2 NAD+ + 2 H O
4 2
The rate of absorbance change at 340/380 nm is proportional to the urea nitrogen concentration
in the sample.
For all assays the analyzer photometer reads the absorbances at time intervals dictated by the
method application stored in the analyzer memory, and the change in absorbance is calculated
automatically.

a) Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted according to the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline.
Within-run precision:
Control samples (low, medium and high levels) were tested using 20 replicates per level.
Testing was performed on one Pictus 500 analyzer using three lots of reagents except for
Calcium and Urea Nitrogen, for which two lots of reagents were used.
Total precision:
Control samples (low, medium and high levels) were tested in duplicate, twice a day, for 20
days, for a total of 80 results per level. Testing was performed on one Pictus 500 analyzer
using three lots of reagents except for Calcium and Urea Nitrogen, for which two lots of
reagents were used.
The within-run and total precision results for a representative reagent lot for each analyte are
presented in the tables below.

b) Linearity:
Linearity studies were conducted according to the CLSI EP06-A guideline.
For each analyte and sample type series of nine levels were prepared by serial dilution of a
known high level sample to produce samples with concentrations spanning the corresponding
claimed measuring intervals. Three reagent lots were evaluated. For each reagent lot, each
level was tested in quadruplicate on the Pictus P500 Analyzer. Results from each level were
averaged and compared against the expected values using linear regression analysis. The
results of the linearity studies support the claimed measuring ranges. The regression analysis
results for a representative reagent lot for each analyte are summarized below.

c) Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were conducted according to the CLSI EP07-A guideline and measured
the effect of endogenous and exogenous substances on neat samples assayed using each of
the Medicon reagents on the Pictus 500 Clinical Analyzer.
Serum and urine sample pools at low and high levels of each analyte were prepared, then
spiked with increasing concentrations of the interference compounds. The spiked and control
samples were tested in duplicate, and the results were averaged. In each case, the spiked
sample result mean was compared to the control (zero interferent) mean result, and bias
values were calculated. Non-interference levels were defined as the concentration at which
the spiked sample value was ≤ ±10% of the control sample value for both serum and urine
samples. The results of the interference studies for each candidate reagent are summarized
below:

f) Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) studies
were performed according to the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
Limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed by testing 5 blank
samples and 5 low level samples 4 times a day for a total of 60 measurements in 3 days,
using 2 or 3 reagent lots . Data was analyzed using non-parametrical statistical analysis. The
LoD was calculated from LoB using the following equation: LoB + 1.654 SD.
To determine limit of quantitation (LoQ), 10 low level samples were measured 5 times each
day for a total of 150 measurements in 3 days. LoQ was defined using an imprecision
acceptance criterion of ≤ 20% CV.
The results are summarized in the table below:

2. Comparison Studies:
a) Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Performance of the Medicon Albumin, Calcium, Creatinine, Glucose, Total Bilirubin and
Urea Nitrogen reagents for serum and (where applicable) urine assayed on the Pictus 500
analyzer was compared with the predicate devices, Beckman Coulter reagents assayed on the
AU2700 analyzer. Performance of the Medicon Direct Bilirubin reagent assayed on the
Pictus 500 analyzer was compared to predicate device, Abbott Diagnostics (AD) Direct
Bilirubin reagent assayed on the AD Architect c8000 analyzer.

Between 77-126 human serum and urine samples were tested in singlicate on the candidate
and predicate systems using at least three lots of Medicon reagents. Less than 10% of
samples were spiked or diluted to cover the analytical measurement ranges. Results were
analyzed using Deming regression statistics for Albumin, Calcium, Creatinine, Glucose,
Total Bilirubin and Urea Nitrogen, and the weighted Deming approach was used for Direct
Bilirubin.
The summary of the results for a representative lot are provided in the table below:

geographical location. Each laboratory should determine its own reference intervals as dictated
by good laboratory practices.”
