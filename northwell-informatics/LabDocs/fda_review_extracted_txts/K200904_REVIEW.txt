A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 is intended for in vitro
diagnostic use for the measurement of % hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (DCCT/NGSP) and
mmol/mol hemoglobin A1c (IFCC) in venous whole blood specimens using ion-exchange high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This test is to be used as an aid in diagnosis of
diabetes and identifying patients who may be at risk for developing diabetes, and for monitoring
of long-term blood glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used to diagnose Diabetes Mellitus in patients with iron
deficiency and hemolytic anemia, various hemoglobinopathies, thalassemias, hereditary
spherocytosis, malignancies and severe chronic hepatic and renal disease.
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used in pregnant patients, patients with heterozygous sickle cell
trait, hemolytic diseases and recent significant or chronic blood loss.
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used in the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.
In cases of rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes the increase of HbA1c values might be delayed
compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions diabetes mellitus
must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentration and/or the typical clinical symptoms.
Only the percent HbA1c values measured by this device should be reported to the health care
provider. The test report displays %HbF and other detected hemoglobin variants; however, the
performance characteristics of the hemoglobin variants detected by this device have not been
reviewed or cleared by the FDA and therefore should not be reported to the healthcare provider.
The hemoglobin variants detected by this device are only to ensure the validity of the HbA1c
results because increased levels of hemoglobin variants may interfere with the percent HbA1c
measurement. If a hemoglobinopathy is suspected, an FDA cleared test system for their
measurement should be used
Hemoglobin A1c testing should not replace glucose testing for type 1 diabetes, in pediatric
patients and pregnant women.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
All performance data was collected using the Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer
HLC-723G8.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 is an automated High-
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system that separates and reports stable
hemoglobin A1c (sA1c) percentage in whole blood. The operational portion of the G8 is
composed of a sampling unit, liquid pump, degasser, column, detector, microprocessors, sample
loader, smart media card, operation panel, and a printer.
The Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 system consists of the following
components:
• G8 Variant Elution Buffer HSi No. 1 (S), No. 2 (S), No. 3 (S)
• TSKgel® G8 Variant HSi (column)
• Hemoglobin A1c Controls Levels 1 and 2
21 CFR 862.1660, Product Code JJX
o
• Hemoglobin A1c Calibrator Set
21 CFR 862.1150, Product Code JIT
o
• Hemolysis and Wash Solution
21 CFR 864.8540, Product Code GGK
o
B Principle of Operation:
The Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 uses ion-exchange HPLC to
separate the stable form of HbA1c (sA1c) from other hemoglobin fractions. The G8 uses a non-
porous cation exchange column and separates the hemoglobin components in the blood.
Separation is achieved by utilizing differences in ionic interactions between the cation and
exchange group on the column resin surface and the hemoglobin components in a step gradient
elution. If a sample contains a hemoglobin variant, the column elutes the fraction depending
upon its charge.

2. Linearity:
Linearity was previously evaluated for this device in k071132.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous and exogenous interference as well as cross-reactivity with acetylated
hemoglobin, carbamylated hemoglobin, labile HbA1c, and aldehyde hemoglobin was
previously evaluated in k131580 and k071132.
Hemoglobin Variant Interference:
A hemoglobin variant study was performed using a total of 130 K3 EDTA venous whole
blood samples known to contain hemoglobin variants HbS, HbC, HbE, HbD, HbA2, and
HbF. Testing of the samples containing hemoglobin variants were performed using the
Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 and compared to results obtained by a
comparator method that has been demonstrated to be free from interference by these
hemoglobin variants (Trinity Biotech Ultra2 for HbS, HbC, HbD, HbE and Bio-Rad Variant
II Turbo 2.0 for HbF and HbA2).

The reportable range for this device is 4.0-16.9% HbA1c.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The assigned HbA1c values of the Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 are
certified by The National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). See the NGSP
website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
The final reportable result is traceable to both the International Federation of Clinical
Chemistry (IFCC) and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The
International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are calculated
using the Master Equation NGSP (%) = 0.09148 × IFCC (mmol/mol) + 2.152. HbA1c results
are provided to the customers using two different units: NGSP equivalent units (%) and IFCC
equivalent units (mmol/mol).

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted at two sites (one external, one internal). A total
of 220 K2-EDTA venous whole blood samples ranging from 4.7% to 15.4% HbA1c were
evaluated. Results obtained on the Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-
723G8 v5.24 were compared to results from the same samples tested on the Trinity Premier
Hb9210 system.

The %Bias component was generated during the method comparison studies using the
Deming regression data for decision levels 5.0% and 6.5% and using the Passing-Bablok
regression data for decision levels 8.0% and 12.0% and is the %Bias shown in the table
below. The variance component (%CV) was generated during the precision studies and
represents the total reproducibility shown in the table below:

2. Matrix Comparison:
The effect on Hemoglobin A1c determination, with the HbA1c assay, in the presence of
anticoagulants was determined on the Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-
723G8 by comparing values obtained from samples drawn into K -EDTA to results obtained
2
from samples in K -EDTA.
3
47 samples of each anticoagulant were evaluated, with %HbA1c concentrations for the
sample sets ranging from 5.12% to 12.86%. The sample tubes were from a total of 47 donors.
Two tubes, one with each anticoagulant, were drawn from each donor. The following are
results from least-squares regression analysis:
y = 1.004x - 0.02021 R2 = 0.999999
The results support the use of the HbA1c assay with samples collected in K -EDTA and K -
2 3
EDTA.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
2. Clinical Specificity:
Not applicable.
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Not applicable.

D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Reference Ranges (non-diabetic): HbA1c 4.0-6.0 % (mean 5.0 %, SD 0.5 %)
Ref: American Diabetes Association. 2. Classification and diagnosis of diabetes: Standards of
Medical Care in Diabetes—2020. Diabetes Care 2020;43(Suppl. 1):S14–S31.
The diagnosis of diabetes and identification of persons at increased risk of developing
diabetes follows the ADA Guideline of 6.5% for the cut-off and values between 5.7% and
6.4% as being at increased risk.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
