III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Clearblue® Early Digital Pregnancy Test is an over-the-counter chromatographic
immunoassay for the qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. This
digital test is intended for use as an aid in early detection of pregnancy, in some cases as early as
six (6) days before the day of the missed period, i.e. as early as five (5) days before the day of the
expected period. The test is intended for home use.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
Clearblue® Early Digital Pregnancy Test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) use.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Clearblue® Early Digital Pregnancy Test is a qualitative lateral flow immunoassay for the
detection of hCG. Each device is provided in a sealed pouch with instructions for use and a
desiccant package to control moisture during storage. The device consists of a plastic-housed test
stick containing an immunochromatographic strip and electronic and optical components along
with a microprocessor and specific algorithms to digitally display test results.
B Principle of Operation:
The Clearblue® Early Digital Pregnancy test is a lateral flow sandwich immunoassay employing
monoclonal antibodies that are specifically directed against the alpha and beta sub-units of hCG.
To use the test, the user either urinates directly onto the absorbent wick or collects a sample in a
clean, dry container and dips the absorbent wick into the collected sample until the Stop Light
begins to flash (which usually takes five seconds for both sampling methods). After the urine
specimen is applied to the device, the hCG present in the specimen will react with a mouse anti-
hCG monoclonal antibody conjugate. The conjugate complex migrates along the membrane
towards the test and control zones. A digital component integral with the chromatographic strip
reads and displays the result of the immunochemical reaction on an LCD screen of the device.
Once the device self-calibration process is completed, a progress bar symbol appears on the
display, indicating that test is working and counting down the time to result. The test is complete
after a result (“Pregnant” for a positive result, “Not Pregnant” for a negative result) or an
error/invalid result (book symbol) is displayed on the LCD. This occurs within one to five
minutes of sample detection.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using a pooled female human negative urine sample spiked
with hCG (traceable to the 4th WHO IS) to obtain samples with hCG concentrations of 0, 3,
4.5, 6, 7.5, 9, 10, 12.5 and 25 mIU/mL. Each sample was tested using three lots of
Clearblue® Early Digital Pregnancy Test devices in both simulated midstream and dip
sampling methods. The tests were performed over the course of 3 non-consecutive days by 3
different operators. A total of 162 replicates were performed per sampling method per hCG
concentration. The device cutoff is 10 mIU/mL hCG.

Cross-reactivity of structurally-related compounds
Clearblue® Early Digital Pregnancy Test devices were tested with three potential cross-
reactants: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH). Each potential cross-reactant was spiked into a negative pooled
human urine sample and a positive pooled human urine sample containing 10 mIU/mL hCG.
Control samples containing no test substance were also tested and compared to test samples.
Test and control samples were tested in replicates of five with each of three lots of candidate
device. The results demonstrated no cross-reactivity from potential cross-reactants up to 500
mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH, and 1 mIU/mL TSH in either negative or positive urine
samples.
Effect of urine pH and Specific Gravity
Negative human urine samples and positive human urine samples containing 10 mIU/mL
hCG were adjusted to pH values from 4.0 to 9.0 and tested using the candidate device. The
results demonstrated that samples within the pH range of 4.0 to 9.0 do not interfere with
either positive or negative results from the device.
Negative human urine samples and positive human urine samples containing 10 mIU/mL
hCG were adjusted to specific gravity values from 1.000 to 1.035 and tested using the
candidate device. The results demonstrated that samples within the specific gravity range of
1.000 to 1.035 do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the device.
Effect of hCG β-core fragment
To evaluate potential interference from hCG β core fragment (hCGβcf), worst-case,
physiologically-relevant combinations of intact hCG and hCGβcf (as supported by published
literature and internal testing) were assessed with the candidate device. Testing was
conducted using multiple devices from 3 lots of devices. No hCGβcf interference was
observed for the following test conditions:

population. The lay users were 18 to 45 years old and had diverse educational and
professional backgrounds. A valid midstream result was obtained from 195 of the lay users
and a valid dip result was obtained from 199 of the lay users. Lay user results compared to
clinical pregnancy status and professional user results are shown below. Ease of use of the
candidate device was assessed through a questionnaire that was completed at the end of the
study. The questionnaire results indicated that lay users found the test easy to use, the results
clear and easy to read and the instructions for use easy to understand.

Specificity Study to Determine False Positive Result Rate
A study was performed to determine the incidence of false positive test results from Clearblue®
Early Digital Pregnancy Test. Urine samples were collected from 150 women from each of four
cohorts: non-pregnant pre-menopausal women aged 18-40 years, non-pregnant peri-menopausal
women aged 41-55 years, non-pregnant post-menopausal women > 55 years of age, and pregnant
women. Samples were tested by trained technicians with three device lots. Results of the study
are shown in the table below.
