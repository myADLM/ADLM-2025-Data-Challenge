C Type of Test:
Quantitative - using optical fluorescence and reflectance technology.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The OPTI® B-Lac cassette is intended to be used for the in vitro measurement of pH, pO , pCO ,
2 2
total hemoglobin (tHb), and % Saturated O in sodium heparinized venous blood samples on the
2
OPTI CCA-TS and OPTI CCA-TS2 platform in a clinical laboratory location.
• Measurements of blood gases (pCO
2
, pO
2
) and blood pH are used in the diagnosis and
treatment of life-threatening acid-base disturbances.
• Total hemoglobin (tHb) measurement is used to determine the hemoglobin content of human
blood.
• Oxygen saturation (SO ) measurement is used to determine the oxygen capacity of the
2
hemoglobin.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
OPTI CCA-TS/TS2 Analyzers
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The OPTI® B-Lac cassette is a disposable, single use cassette that contains four sensors for in
vitro quantitative measurements of pO , pCO , pH and Lactate. The cassette includes additional
2 2
laser-based measurements of total hemoglobin (tHb) and SO . The pO , pH, tHb, and SO
2 2 2
sensors were not modified from the previous clearance (k093280). The B-Lac cassette is sealed
in a foil pouch along with a desiccant and is marked with a barcode label that includes a lot
identification number, calibration information, and expiration date.
B Principle of Operation:
The OPTI® B-Lac cassette uses fluorescence optodes to measure the intensity of light emitted
from fluorescent dyes exposed to specific analytes. The concentration of the analyte is
determined by the calculation of the difference in fluorescence measured at a defined calibration
point and that measured with the unknown concentration of analyte. The principles of
K200986 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
measurement of pO , pCO and pH for the B-Lac cassette are similar to those used with existing
2 2
cassette styles that are used on the OPTI CCA-TS/TS2 (k984299).

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
In-House Within Run Precision Evaluation:
Within run precision testing was performed using venous whole blood manipulated to three
different levels (tonometered for gases, spiked or diluted for tHb) and three levels of aqueous
quality control solutions (OPTI Check Level 1, 2 and 3) following the experimental protocol
recommended in the CLSI guideline EP05-A3. The samples were run in multiple replicates
on three separate lots of B-Lac cassettes. Each lot was run on one OPTI CCA-TS and one
OPTI CCA-TS2 analyzer for pH, pCO , pO , tHb, and SO .
2 2 2
The data supported that the performance in venous whole blood in clinical laboratory settings
as demonstrated in k093280 for pO , pH, tHb, and SO has not changed. A summary of the
2 2
within-run precision results for one representative lot for pCO is presented in the tables

In-House Multi-Day Precision Testing:
A 20-Day precision study was performed using three levels of aqueous quality control
solutions, following the experimental protocol recommended in the CLSI guideline EP05-
A3. Typical within-run, between-day and total precision were determined from four runs per
day over 20 days on three lots of B-Lac cassettes. Each lot of cassette was run on one OPTI
CCA-TS and one OPTI-CCA-TS2 analyzer. The data supported that the performance in
venous whole blood in clinical laboratory settings as demonstrated in k093280 for pO , pH,
2
tHb, and SO has not changed. A summary of the multi-day precision results for one

2. Linearity:
To evaluate the linearity of the B-Lac pCO , pO , pH, tHb and SO venous whole blood
2 2 2 ,
samples from different donors collected in sodium heparin tubes were tonometered with a
range of %CO and %O gas mixtures to generate samples with pCO , pO , pH, and SO
2 2 2 2 2
values spanning the claimed measuring ranges. Venous whole blood was manipulated
(centrifuged and spiked with red blood cells or diluted with plasma, then tonometered with
6% CO / 12% O gas) to obtain tHb values spanning the claimed measuring range. Testing
2 2
was performed using three different lots of B-Lac cassettes with three replicate
measurements being taken for each lot for each sample, on one CCA-TS analyzer and one
CCA-TS2 analyzer. The concentrations for pH and tHb were assigned using the ABL90
FLEX analyzer. For pO and pCO the concentrations were assigned by tonometry as well as
2 2
using the ABL90 FLEX analyzer. The SO concentration was assigned using the OPTI CCA
2
TS/TS2 E Series Cassette.
The data supported that the performance in venous whole blood in clinical laboratory settings
as demonstrated in k093280 for pO , pH, tHb, and SO has not changed. For the pCO
2 2 2
sensor, the results of the linear regression analysis per instrument type are presented in the

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The B-Lac cassette was evaluated to determine the potential interference of endogenous and
exogenous substances. The study used human venous whole blood samples and was
conducted for all the analytes at two concentration levels (see table below). For pH, pCO ,
2
pO2, tHb and SO two different analyte levels were generated by tonometering with different
2,
gas mixtures. For tHb, the low level sample was generated by dilution with plasma. All the
samples were spiked with the potential interferents (test samples) and were measured against
the samples that were not spiked (control samples). The sponsor states that interferences were
considered to be non-significant if the bias between the test and control samples were as
follows:
Parameter Maximum allowed difference (analyte level)
pCO 2.5 mmHg (83 mm Hg) or 4% (17 mm Hg)

pO 2.5 mmHg (48 mm Hg) or 4% (416 mmHg)

The substances that were found to have significant interference are listed in the Operator’s
manuals. In addition, for pH, the labeling includes the following limitation for fluorescein,
which was tested in a separate study not reviewed in this submission:
“At the interferent concentration tested (1.064 mM), the pH will be suppressed. However, for
lower concentrations, the pH may show a bias.”
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Please see the linearity study above.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability for all analytes was previously described and reviewed in k093280.
Total hemoglobin (tHb) shelf-life stability studies were reviewed and considered acceptable
to support the claims previously cleared in k093280.
6. Detection Limit:
Linearity studies were used to support the lower end of the measuring range for pH, pCO ,

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted using native venous whole blood samples
collected in sodium heparin blood collection tubes. A small percentage (<10%) manipulated
blood samples (tonometered, spiked or diluted) were added to cover the measurement ranges.
This method comparison study was carried out using three different lots of B-Lac cassettes
on both OPTI CCA-TS and OPTI CCA-TS2 instruments. Each blood sample was tested in
singlicate across three CCA-TS and three CCA-TS2 analyzers with one cassette lot per
analyzer. Each sample was also tested on predicate instruments with the ABL90 FLEX used
for pH, pCO , pO and tHb and OPTI CCA E-series cassettes for SO .
2 2 2
The results on the OPTI CCA-TS and OPTI CCA-TS2 instrument types were analyzed
separately. The data supported that the performance in venous whole blood in clinical
laboratory settings as demonstrated in k093280 for pO , pH, tHb and SO has not changed.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Method Comparison at Altitude:
A method comparison at altitude study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the B-
Lac cassette pCO , pO and pH sensors and measured tHb and SO parameters against the
2 2 2
ABL90 FLEX Analyzer at a range of altitudes. Both contrived venous whole blood samples
and aqueous control materials were used in the study and testing was conducted at two
clinical sites (1080 feet and 10151 feet altitude) for venous whole blood samples and at four
clinical sites (ranging from 75 feet – 10551 altitude) for aqueous control samples. The results
of the study supported the performance of the B-Lac cassette for all parameters up to 10151
feet altitude.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
