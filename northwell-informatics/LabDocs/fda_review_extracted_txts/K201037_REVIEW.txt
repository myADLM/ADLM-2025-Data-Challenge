D Special Instrument Requirements:
Fora ADVANCED GD40 Meter
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The FORA ADVANCED GD40 Glucose, β-Ketone and Cholesterol Monitoring System consists
of the FORA ADVANCED GD40 Meter, the FORA ADVANCED GD40 Blood Glucose strips,
the FORA ADVANCED GD40 β-Ketone strips, the FORA ADVANCED GD40 Total
Cholesterol strips, and control solutions (3 levels for glucose, 2 levels for ketone, and 2 levels for
cholesterol). The test strips and controls are required but not included with the system kit and
must be purchased separately. A lancing device and sterile lancets are also required but not
included with the system kit and must be purchased separately.
The FORA ADVANCED GD40 glucose and β-Ketone strips, and the FORA glucose and β-
ketone control solutions were previously cleared in k161738. The meter was also previously
cleared (k161738) as the FORA ADVANCED GD-40 Blood Glucose and β-Ketone meter (now
the FORA ADVANCED GD-40 meter). The FORA ADVANCED GD40 Total Cholesterol
strips and FORA cholesterol control solutions are new.
K201037 - Page 3 of 16

--- Page 4 ---
B Principle of Operation:
Glucose measurement is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using the enzyme,
glucose dehydrogenase, to catalyze the formation of gluconolactone from the oxidation of
glucose whereby two electrons are produced. The electrical current resulting from this enzymatic
reaction is measured and correlated to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the
current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample. The test strip is calibrated to
display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow comparison of results with laboratory
methods.
Using the same technology, β-hydroxybutyrate (β-ketone) is converted by β-hydroxybutyrate
dehydrogenase and the magnitude of electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is
proportional to the amount of β-hydroxybutyrate present in the sample.
Cholesterol esters in serum are completely hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase to free cholesterol
and free fatty acids, whereby liberated cholesterol, plus any endogenous free cholesterol, are
oxidized by cholesterol oxidase and the magnitude of electrical current resulting from this
enzymatic reaction is proportional to the amount of cholesterol present in the sample.
Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
FORA ADVANCED GD40 Meter
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger. The whole
blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
4. Calibration:
A code strip is provided, and the user is instructed to calibrate every time a new vial of total
cholesterol test strips is begun. Coding is similar for β-ketone. The code strips contain lot
specific test strip information such as the calibration curve and the test strip lot number.
Users are instructed to ensure that the code number on the meter display, code strip, and test
strip vial are the same before proceeding with testing. Glucose measurements do not require
coding.
5. Quality Control:
The sponsor provides 3 levels of FORA Glucose Control Solutions, 2 levels of β-Ketone
Control Solutions, and 2 levels of Total Cholesterol Control Solutions. The controls are used
K201037 - Page 4 of 16

--- Page 5 ---
to check that the that the meter, code strips (for cholesterol and β-ketones) and test strips are
working together properly and that the test is performing correctly. Control solutions for
glucose and β-ketones are recognized automatically by the meter while the user must mark
cholesterol control solution as such. Users are instructed to run controls:
• When using the meter for the first time.
• At least once a week to routinely check the meter and test strips.
• With a new vial of test strips.
• If the user suspects the meter or test strips are not working properly.
• If the test results are not consistent with how the user feels, or if the user thinks the
results are not accurate.
• To practice the testing process
• If the user has dropped the meter or suspects they may have damaged it.
The acceptable range for the control solutions is printed on the side of the test strip vial.

Multi-site Precision:
A multi-site precision study was conducted at three (3) sites using two (2) levels of native venous
whole blood samples (P2 and P3) and two (2) levels of quality controls (Q2 “normal range” and
Q3 “high range”). Three (3) operators conducted testing using two (2) meters per site on five (5)
days. Five (5) replicates per sample were tested on one (1) run per day. All sites used the same
three (3) reagent and calibrator lots. The data was analyzed by ANOVA and the results are
summarized below. The venous whole blood samples (P2 and P3) were prepared fresh for each
testing day.

2. Linearity:
The sponsor provided a linearity study using three (3) lots of test strips, five (5) meters, one (1)
high level (>400 mg/dL), and one (1) low level (<100 mg/dL) native venous blood samples.
The high and low samples were used to prepare nine (9) samples ranging from 96 - 405 mg/dL
with a known relationship to each other. For each level, the mean of five (5) measurements was
compared to the expected value.
The maximum deviation from linearity that was observed within the claimed measuring interval
for all three lots was 2.2%.
The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 100-400 mg/dL for
total cholesterol.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
An endogenous and exogenous interference study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP7,
Ed.3: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. The study used four (4) meters and test strips
from one (1) lot. Two (2) venous whole blood samples at cholesterol concentrations of
approximately 180 mg/dL and 240 mg/dL from healthy subjects were used. Samples with native

analyte were supplemented with potentially interfering compounds at levels listed in the table
below.
Samples were tested in singlicate using four candidate meters. The four meter measurements
were averaged and the percent bias between control and test samples was calculated. Non-
interference was defined as a difference of ≤10% from the control sample. If the percent bias was
greater than ±10%, a dose response test was performed to determine the highest concentration of
interfering substance that does not interfere with assay performance. The percent bias between
control and test samples was calculated as follows:
Bias% = {[Mean(test) – Mean(control)]/ Mean(control)} x 100%

The sponsor includes the following limitations in the labeling for the FORA ADVANCED GD40
Glucose, β-Ketone and Cholesterol Monitoring System which were developed to explain the
interferences for all three test strips based on the analytical specificity data for the cholesterol
strips described above and based on the analytical specificity data for the ketones and glucose
strips described in k161738:
• Acetaminophen in your blood >6.25 mg/dL might affect the reliability of your blood
glucose results. If you are taking Tylenol, your glucose results may not be reliable. If you
are unsure, then ask your healthcare provider.
• If you have a disease or condition that elevates your blood uric acid level (>10 mg/dL),
such as gout, your blood glucose results may not be reliable. If you are unsure, then ask
your healthcare provider.
• Xylose: Do not test blood glucose during or soon after a xylose absorption test. Xylose in
the blood can give falsely elevated results.

6. Detection Limit:
The detection limits studies of the candidate device’s cholesterol assay were conducted in
accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB: To estimate the LoB, the sponsor used four (4) meters, two (2) cholesterol strip lots, and
five (5) different analyte-free (blank) venous blood samples. Each blank sample was analyzed in
replicates of four (4) on three (3) different days. The limit of blank was estimated by
interpolation from the ranked values to be 15 mg/dL.
LoD: To estimate the LoD, the sponsor used four (4) meters, two (2) cholesterol strip lots, and
venous blood samples at five (5) different concentrations. Each sample was analyzed in
replicates of four (4) on three (3) different days. The data was evaluated using the parametric
analysis recommended in CLSI EP17-A2 and the LoD was estimated to be 26 mg/dL.
LoQ: To estimate the LoQ, the sponsor used two (2) meters, two (2) cholesterol strip lots, and
venous blood samples at nine (9) different concentrations. Each sample was tested in replicates
of two (2) on twenty (20) different days. The LoQ estimate for each lot was determined as the
measurand concentration at the intersection of its power function model fit line with the
imprecision goal of a 10% CV. The LoQ of total cholesterol was 97 mg/dL.
The sponsor chose 100 mg/dL as the lowest reportable cholesterol concentration.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted to determine the accuracy performance of the
candidate device’s cholesterol test. The study included 408 participants at three (3) sites (136
subjects per site).
Of the participants, 223 (54.7%) were male and 185 (45.3%) were female. The ages of the
participants were from 22 to 74 years with a mean age of 55.5 years and adequately represented
the intended use population.

Participants self-collected a capillary blood sample for cholesterol testing. After testing, nursing
staff collected a venous blood sample for comparison on the comparator method. Total
cholesterol levels were between 106 mg/dL and 388 mg/dL. Three (3) reagent (strip) lots were
used in the study.
The differences between the self-collected results and the comparator method were estimated
according to the following equation:
Meter Value (mg/dL/mmol/L) – Comparator Method (mg/dL/mmol/L)
__________________________________________________________________________________ X 100% = % Diff
Comparator Method Value (mg/dL/mmol/L)
Results are summarized in the following table:

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
A “mock” study was conducted to evaluate the lay user’s ability to understand and distinguish
glucose and cholesterol results obtained with the same meter. The study included 500
participants at 3 sites. Participants were randomly divided into five groups and were provided
with samples with varying levels of cholesterol and glucose combinations. Observers noted
whether participants could correctly identify and distinguish between cholesterol and glucose
results.
Analysis of the number of participants who correctly differentiated glucose and cholesterol
measurements, as compared to the result observed by the observer, showed 100% correct results
across all 3 sites.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit Study:
A hematocrit study was performed to verify that the total cholesterol measurement is not affected
by hematocrit levels between the range of 10% to 70% over a wide range of total cholesterol
levels. Ten (10) meters, (one) 1 lot of test strips, and venous blood samples at concentrations of
153 mg/dL, 182 mg/dL, 264 mg/dL and 334 mg/dL were used in the study. Hematocrit was
adjusted to 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70%. The % bias at each hematocrit level
relative to the nominal hematocrit level of 40% was calculated. The acceptance criterion was that

--- Page 15 ---
the total cholesterol bias be within ±10% compared to the nominal condition of hematocrit at
40%. The data provided supports the claimed hematocrit range of 20 – 70%.
2. Altitude Effect Evaluation:
An altitude effect study was conducted to evaluate the effect of different altitudes on cholesterol
measurements. A glove box system, which simulates three altitude conditions from sea level to
3500 meters (11,484 feet), was used. Venous whole blood samples from healthy donors at five
(5) different levels of cholesterol (119, 182, 228, 262, and 345 mg/dL) were tested at various
atmospheric pressures which simulate different altitudes. Four (4) candidate devices were used to
measure cholesterol and the results were compared to the comparator method and to the results at
sea level. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was that the bias to the comparator method and to
sea level be ≤ ± 10%. The acceptance criteria were satisfied and supported the sponsor’s claimed
altitude of 10742 feet (3274 meters).
3. Temperature and Humidity Studies:
The operating conditions for the glucose and β-ketones test system were established in k161738.
The operating conditions for the cholesterol functionality were assessed in the current
submission and demonstrated that the cholesterol assay functions as intended within the labeled
operating conditions of 50-104o F (10-40o C) and relative humidity of 10-85%.
4. Sample Volume Study:
A sample volume study was conducted on the FORA ADVANCED GD40 Glucose, β-Ketone
and Cholesterol Monitoring System to verify the robustness of the system to variations in the
intended five (5) μL sample volume and to test the meter’s functionality at detecting insufficient
volumes. Five (5) meters and three (3) different venous blood samples at different levels of total
cholesterol (140, 240, and 340 mg/dL) were used in the study. Sample volumes from 4.7µL to
5.2µL were tested under normal operating conditions (25℃ (77°F) at 60% RH). Reported results
were within ±5% bias and sample volumes between 4.7µL and 4.8µL provided an error for
insufficient volume in 100% of the readings. Sixty percent of the (60%) readings for the 4.9µL
volume provided a result and 40% provided and error for insufficient volume. The results
support the recommended 5µL volume.
5. Infection Control Studies:
The FORA ADVANCED GD40 Glucose, β-Ketone and Cholesterol Monitoring System is
intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were previously performed
(k161738) on the exterior materials of the meter by an outside commercial laboratory service to
demonstrate complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with Micro-Kill Wipes (EPA Reg.
No. 59894-10-37549). Robustness studies were performed by the sponsor (in k161738 for
glucose and ketones and in the current submission for cholesterol) demonstrating that there was
no change in performance or in external materials of the meters after 10,950 cleaning and
disinfection cycles with Micro-Kill Wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5
years of single-patient use. The labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the cleaning
and disinfection procedures.

and controls package inserts demonstrating that they are written at an 8th grade reading level or
less.
