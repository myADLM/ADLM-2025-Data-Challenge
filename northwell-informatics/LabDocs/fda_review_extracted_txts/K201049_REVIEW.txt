B Principle of Operation:
G6PD activity is measured from a whole blood sample input. Red blood cells are lysed
osmotically in the cartridge by combining whole blood with water. The lysed blood cells are then
incubated with β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) and glucose-6-phosphate
(G6P), resulting in the production of NADPH. Kinetic fluorescence measurements are used to
quantify the rate of NADPH production, which is proportional to G6PD enzymatic activity. The
reaction occurs in the presence of maleimide, which is used to improve the specificity of the test
by inhibiting the production of NADPH from 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Hemoglobin
present in the lysed sample is measured by absorbance and used to normalize G6PD enzymatic
activity, resulting in a final reported unit of U/gHb.
The FINDER G6PD test reports the hemoglobin normalized G6PD activity in U/gHb and a
percentage of the site-specific Adjusted Male Median (%AMM). The site-specific AMM is
calculated using a minimum of 36 normal male samples and can be set by the user.
Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
FINDER Instrument
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is performed by use of a barcode reader in the FINDER Instrument.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Venous whole blood samples are collected into lithium-heparin devices. Blood collection
devices should be used in accordance with the manufacturer’s labeling, including adhering to
specific fill volume requirements. To perform a test on the FINDER device, 50 μL of
lithium-heparin whole blood sample is required.
4. Calibration:
Each lot of FINDER cartridge is factory calibrated by the manufacture and the calibration
data for each test is included within the 2D barcode label that is placed on the Cartridge. This
barcode is scanned at the beginning of each test.
5. Quality Control:
Performance of the FINDER system can be verified by analyzing commercially available off-
the-shelf hemolysate quality control materials. The quality control material should be run at
the start of each day.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were designed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3.
Single-site precision study was performed at one internal site over a period of 21 non-
consecutive days with two runs per day and two replicates per run. Three hemolysate quality
control samples were used to create three concentrations of G6PD (low = 1.4 U/gHb,
medium = 7.0 U/gHb, high = 17.4 U/gHb). Samples were tested by two qualified operators
on a total of three FINDER instruments. Three lots of FINDER G6PD Test Cartridges were
used in the study.

The reproducibility study was conducted at three separate laboratories using fresh whole blood
samples that were prepared each of five days by appropriate dilution to obtain three target
G6PD levels (low ≤ 2.0 U/gHb, medium = 3.0–5.0 U/gHb, and high ≥ 8.0 U/gHb). Each day,
aliquots at the three sample levels were delivered to each testing lab, where they were
subdivided into eight samples that were evaluated on two instruments running by two
operators, with two replicates each. A total of 15 samples (three G6PD levels, prepared on each
of five days) were evaluated, and each sample was measured by the FINDER Instrument 24
times (across three sites, two instruments, two operators per site, two replicates), resulting in a
total of 360 measurements for analysis.

2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP06-A. The linearity test for FINDER
G6PD test was conducted in two separated studies and linearity range was determined to be
0.8 to 19.7 U/gHb.
The first linearity study used contrived samples of recombinant G6PD enzyme spiked into
whole blood to achieve activity levels that cover the intended linear range of the product.
Nine samples were generated with increasing levels of G6PD activity from 2.0 to 19.7
U/gHb. Each level was tested in eight replicates using a single lot of the FINDER G6PD Test
Cartridge by three operators on six FINDER instruments.
The second study used whole blood from a normal donor and a G6PD-deficient donor. The
native linearity study was performed to ensure that linearity demonstrated in the contrived
study is not an artifact associated with usage of recombinant G6PD. Nine whole blood
samples were prepared with increasing levels of G6PD activity from 0.8 to 13.9 U/gHb. Each
level was tested in eight replicates using a single lot FINDER G6PD Test Cartridge by two
operators on six FINDER instruments.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP07.
One lot of FINDER G6PD Test Cartridges was used at the internal site. Whole blood test
samples were spiked with possible interfering substances at concentrations equal to or greater
than the guideline. Each whole blood sample was tested at two G6PD enzymatic activity
levels: normal G6PD activity (>7.0 U/gHb) and near the medical decision level (2.0–4.0
U/gHb). Spiked samples (test pools) were compared to control pool without the interfering
substances.
Hematocrit values greater than 40% did not interfere with the G6PD test result. A bias of
-15.3% was observed for a normal sample at 29% hematocrit (8.9 g/dL hemoglobin on
FINDER) as compared to the control pool of 50% hematocrit (15.3 g/dL hemoglobin on
FINDER). A bias of -11.1% was observed for a sample near the medical decision level at
30% hematocrit (11.3 g/dL hemoglobin on FINDER) as compared to the control pool of 50%
hematocrit (15.3 g/dL hemoglobin on FINDER).

extinction coefficient of 6.3 mM-1cm-1 .
(2) FINDER G6PD Test Cartridge Shelf-Life Stability:
The shelf-life stability was conducted as per EP25-A at one internal site. Real-time
stability studies were conducted at 2–8°C at different time points (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10,
12, 17, 21, 27, 39, 40, 50, 68, 77 and 83 weeks) using three lots of FINDER G6PD Test
Cartridges. Five replicates of two hemolysate controls (G6PD Low and G6PD high) were
tested on six FINDER instruments. The expiry date for FINDER G6PD Test Cartridges is
currently set at 77 weeks at 2–8°C based on the results of the real-time stability study.
(3) FINDER G6PD Test Cartridge Pouch Stability:
In-Use/Open Pouch Stability
An in-use/open pouch stability study was conducted at one internal site. One control
hemolysate sample (G6PD high) was tested at 0, 1 and 2 hours with three lots of
FINDER G6PD Test Cartridges at room temperature (18–25°C) after its removal from
the foil pouch. Six replicates were tested for each time point on six FINDER instruments.

The storage conditions ranged from 19.4–20.1°C at 24.3–27.9 %RH. The data supports
the open pouch (cartridge outside of the foil) stability of one hour at room temperature.
In-Use Unopened Pouch Stability
A real-time stability study to determine the storage stability at room temperature of the
unopened cartridge in the foil pouch was performed. The study evaluated FINDER G6PD
Test Cartridges stored at the upper end of room temperature (~30°C) using two levels of
hemolysate samples, G6PD high and G6PD intermediate. Five replicates of each sample
at each time point (0, 4, 8 and 10 hours) were tested. Cartridge in-use stability in an
unopened foil pouch was determined to be eight hours at room temperature.
(4) Sample Stability
Two different sample stability studies were conducted at one internal site. Five venous
whole blood samples from healthy adults collected in lithium heparin tubes were
measured with FINDER G6PD test under refrigerated storage (2–8°C) for up to 77 hours
and at room temperature (18–25°C) for up to 4 hours. One lot of FINDER G6PD
cartridge was used in this study. Three replicates of each sample were tested at each time
point on six FINDER instruments.
Another sample stability study was conducted to include additional G6PD deficient
samples: one sample near the medical decision level (3.1 U/gHb) and one deficient
sample (<2.0 U/gHb). The real-time sample storage stability was determined by
evaluating venous whole blood samples collected in lithium heparin tubes and stored at
both room temperature (18–25°C) and refrigerated conditions (2–8°C). Each sample was
analyzed on the FINDER for a total of six replicates for each of the five time points
tested. The study was performed with one cartridge lot at a single site.
Both studies support the whole blood sample stability of one hour stored at room
temperature (18–25°C) and 71 hours under the refrigerated condition (2–8°C).
(5) Controls
Performance of the FINDER system can be verified by analyzing commercially available
off-the-shelf hemolysate quality control materials.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
for the FINDER G6PD test were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. The studies
were conducted using three lots of FINDER G6PD Cartridges on six FINDER instruments at
one internal site. The LoB was evaluated using samples with blank G6PD activity. The LoD
was evaluated using samples at low G6PD activity. The LoQ was evaluated using four whole
blood samples with increasing levels of G6PD activity prepared by spiking a blank pool with
increasing concentrations of a normal pool.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The reference range study was conducted with 136 healthy subjects. The 95% reference range
was determined to be 7.1–14.1 U/gHb for the FINDER G6PD test.
F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. FINDER G6PD Cartridge Packaging Validation, Environmental/Transit Testing
The study was conducted to verify the FINDER cartridge transit packaging meets the
packaging requirements as defined by the FINDER Product Requirements Document when
subjected to summer/winter shipping conditions. Six transit packages of cartridge cartons
were used in this study and each carton holds 16 individual cartridges. The packaging
validation study demonstrated that no significant damage was sustained on the transit
package, the cartridge cartons, or the individually packaged cartridges. The cartridge transit
packaging successfully maintained cartridges at 2–25 °C while exposed to the applied testing
temperatures (-10–35 °C)
2. FINDER Instrument Packaging Validation, Environmental/Transit Testing
The study was conducted to verify the FINDER instrument meets environmental and transit
requirements when subjected to different humidity levels (30 %RH and 80 %RH),
temperatures (-10–35°C), altitude (0 to 2000 meters), transit shock and vibration conditions.
All tests successfully passed with no effect on performance or noticeable damage occurring.
The transit/environmental test conditions are claimed as: -10–35°C, 30 %RH to 80 %RH, up
to 2000 meters above mean sea level for the storage and transit conditions.
