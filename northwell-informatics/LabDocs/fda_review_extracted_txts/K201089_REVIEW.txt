B Indication(s) for Use:
The ARK Lacosamide Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay intended for the
quantitative determination of lacosamide in human serum on automated clinical chemistry
analyzers. The measurements obtained are used in monitoring levels of lacosamide to help
ensure appropriate therapy.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Performance characteristics studies were conducted on the Beckman AU680 clinical chemistry
analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ARK Lacosamide Assay consists of:
• Reagent R1: anti-lacosamide polyclonal antibody, glucose-6-phosphate, nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide, bovine serum albumin, sodium azide, and stabilizers
• Reagent R2: lacosamide labeled with bacterial G6PDH enzyme, buffer, bovine serum
albumin, sodium azide, and stabilizers
B Principle of Operation:
The device is a homogenous enzyme immunoassay based on competition of free drug in the
sample and drug labeled with enzyme for antibody binding sites. In the absence of free drug in
the sample, the antibody binds the enzyme-labeled drug, resulting in inhibition of enzyme
activity. In the presence of drug in the sample, enzyme activity increases and is directly related to
the drug concentration. The enzyme activity is measured spectrophotometrically on an automated
clinical chemistry analyzer.

2. Analytical Recovery and Dilution Linearity:
To evaluate linearity, a lacosamide-negative human serum pool spiked with lacosamide at
25.00 µg/mL was serially diluted with lacosamide-negative human serum to generate ten
intermediate levels (0.00, 0.40, 1.50, 3.00, 6.00, 9.00, 12.00, 15.00, 18.00, 21.00, and 25.00
µg/mL). Each sample was run in replicates of six, and the average was used to determine
percent recovery compared to the expected target value. The observed result (y) and the
target expected result (x) were compared using the first-order polynomial regression method.
The regression equation and correlation obtained were:
y = 0.9998x - 0.0170; r2 = 0.9994
This evaluation supports linearity within the claimed measuring range of 0.40 to 24.00
µg/mL.

Recovery
An analytical recovery study was conducted on the Beckman Coulter AU680 to determine
the effect of differing concentrations of lacosamide on recovery by spiking lacosamide into
human serum negative for lacosamide. Two analytical runs of three replicates of each sample
were assayed; the results of all six replicates of each sample were averaged and compared to
the target concentration. The results are as follows:
Theoretical Concentration Mean Recovered Percent Recovery (%)
(µg/mL) Concentration (µg/mL)
0.40 0.36 90.4
0.50 0.47 93.3
1.00 1.04 104.2
3.00 3.07 102.3

20.00 21.15 105.8
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference from Endogenous Substances:
Interference from elevated lipid levels or endogenous substances was evaluated by spiking
compounds into lacosamide-negative human serum spiked with lacosamide stock solution to
a final concentration of 2.00 µg/mL and 15.00 µg/mL. The samples were tested in two
analytical runs of three replicates (n = 6) for each sample, and mean measurements were
calculated. Percentage recovery of lacosamide in the presence of elevated endogenous
interfering compound was calculated versus the respective mean control lacosamide
measurement. A substance was considered to not interfere if the mean measurement of
lacosamide in its presence was equivalent to its corresponding mean control measurement
±10%. Concentrations tested and results are shown below. No significant interference was
observed.

Interference from Exogenous Substances:
Cross-reactivity or potential interference from the lacosamide metabolite O-desmethyl-
lacosamide or potentially coadministered compounds was assessed by supplementing pooled
human serum with the potential interferent, then spiking the serum with a lacosamide stock
solution to a final concentration of 2.00 µg/mL and 15.00 µg/mL. The samples were tested in
two analytical runs of three replicates (n = 6) for each sample, and mean measurements were
calculated. Percentage recovery of lacosamide in the presence of elevated endogenous
interfering compound was calculated versus the respective mean control lacosamide
measurement. No significant interference was observed.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
Human serum containing 0.40 to 24.00 µg/mL lacosamide
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The ARK Lacosamide Calibrator is traceable to a certified reference standard (Cerilliant),
and the uncertainty in the lacosamide concentration is 5% relative to the concentration in the
certified reference standard.
Specimen Stability:
Real-time stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
adequate. Simulated serum specimens were shown to be stable for at least 48 hours at room
temperature (22°C), 28 days when refrigerated (2-8°C), and after three successive
freeze/thaw cycles; clinical specimens were shown to be stable when frozen (-20°C) for at
least 34 months.
Product Stability/Shelf Life:
Protocols for real-time and accelerated stability and shelf life studies were reviewed and
found to be acceptable. Results supported a shelf-life stability claim of up to 18 months for
the ARK Lacosamide Reagents when stored unopened at 2-8°C. Reagents were stable up to
60 days when stored on-board the instrument.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
determined according to CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. Samples were prepared by spiking
lacosamide-negative human serum with a stock solution of lacosamide.

LoB and LoD were evaluated by testing 60 replicates of pooled human serum and 60
replicates of the first positive level, 0.10 µg/mL lacosamide. The analyzer was then
calibrated and three analytical runs were performed; in each, 20 blank replicates and 20
replicates of 0.10 µg/mL lacosamide were analyzed, for each of four device lots. The grand
mean and root mean square standard deviation (RMSD) were calculated. The LoB was
calculated to be 0.00 µg/mL lacosamide, and the LoD was calculated to be 0.02 µg/mL
lacosamide.
LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration for which acceptable inter-assay precision
(≤20% CV) and recovery (±15%) were observed. To determine LoQ, three levels were tested
below the lowest positive calibrator concentration (0.75 µg/mL). Pooled human serum
representative of the patient specimen matrix was supplemented with lacosamide to give
concentrations of 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 µg/mL lacosamide. Eight replicates of each sample
were tested in each of five runs to give a minimum of 40 replicates of each LoQ sample
tested for each of four device lots. The grand mean, RMSD, and coefficient of variance for
each test sample were calculated. The LoQ was determined to be 0.40 µg/mL lacosamide.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The package insert includes the following statement:
“Therapeutic drug monitoring of antiepileptic drug (AED) is used worldwide as an aid to
individualize drug therapy, and various guidelines have been published that highlight the
particular properties of AEDs and the features of epilepsy that make TDM useful.1-4
Observational studies have suggested reference ranges for lacosamide concentrations, with
dosage as a contributing factor. Recommended reference ranges vary from 2.2 to 20 mg/L,5 and
ranges of 5 µg/mL to 10 µg/mL6 or 10 µg/mL to 20 µg/mL7 have also been proposed. Altered
serum lacosamide disposition may result in serum concentrations that are too low to maintain
efficacy, or elevated with the increased potential to cause adverse effects or toxicity, suggesting
the potential need for TDM. Factors that may affect lacosamide pharmacokinetics include renal
function, pregnancy status, age, and critical illness.5
Steady state concentrations may be achieved after 3 days of treatment.8 Lacosamide
concentrations in serum increased dose dependently, were age independent, and were higher in
women compared with men.9 Monitoring lacosamide may benefit retention of therapy among
patients with intellectual disability.10 Coadministration of carbamazepine and phenytoin
(inducers of drug-metabolizing enzymes) may decrease serum concentrations of lacosamide
substantially.9,11
Case reports associated with lacosamide toxicity have included: (1) a 70-year-old female
experienced life-threatening ventricular tachycardia,12 (2) a 26-year-old male, who after
ingestion of 6,000 mg of lacosamide in a suicide attempt, a 10 h post-ingestion was well above
the reference range at 44.5 µg/mL,13 and (3) another case in which mental status changes and
abnormal ECG occurred and for which hemodialysis brought the patient back to baseline.14
Generally, clinicians using reference ranges such as these should be aware that, because of
individual variation, patients may achieve therapeutic benefit with serum drug concentrations
outside of these ranges and may experience toxicity with levels below the lower limit of the
reference range. Lacosamide drug concentrations should not be the only means of therapeutic
drug management. The assay should be used in conjunction with information available from
clinical evaluations and other diagnostic procedures. Clinicians should carefully monitor patients
during therapy and dosage adjustments.”
