B Indication(s) for Use:
The microINR® System measures prothrombin time (PT) expressed in International Normalized
Ratio (INR), for monitoring oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin.
The microINR® System consists of a microINR® Meter and microINR® Chip and uses fresh
capillary whole blood from a fingerstick.
The microINR® System is intended for patient self-testing use as well as for healthcare
professionals at Point of Care settings.
The microINR® System is intended for use in patients 18 years old or older. Patients must be
stable on warfarin medication for at least 6 weeks before starting to use the microINR® System.
For Self-testing use: The System is intended for properly trained users under specific
prescription of a physician.
Caution: The microINR® System is not intended for use in patients who are transitioning from
heparin treatment to VKA therapy. The microINR® System is not intended to be used for
screening purposes.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

D Special Instrument Requirements:

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The microINR System is comprised of a portable measuring device (microINR Meter) and test
strips (microINR Chips) in which the capillary blood sample flows through capillary action.
The microINR Chip contains a reagent in dried form which consists of thromboplastin, and
contains two symmetrical regions, the measuring channel and a control channel. The microINR
Meter measures International Normalized Ratio (INR) based on a Prothrombin Time (PT) assay
carried out in the microINR Chip based on microfluidic technology with machine vision
detection.
The microINR System has a multi-level On-board Quality Control. Multiple key functions and
elements of the system are checked and if deviations are detected, error messages are displayed
and test results are not reported.
B Principle of Operation:
The microINR System was previously cleared for professional use under premarket notification
K180780. The test principle has not been modified:
The microINR System is a closed system, which is intended to be used exclusively with the
microINR Chips manufactured by iLine Microsystems, S.L. The microINR System is a handheld
in vitro diagnostic medical device that uses microfluidic technology with machine vision
detection to measure the prothrombin time from a fresh capillary (fingerstick) whole blood
K201185 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
sample. The fresh capillary (fingerstick) whole blood sample is applied to the microINR Chips
(test strips) for testing. The microINR Chip is inserted into the analyzer. Two microcapillary
channels in the test strip are filled with the blood sample by capillary action. The microINR Chip
contains a preparation of human recombinant tissue factor, synthetic phospholipids and
stabilizers. The microINR Meter measures the International Normalized Ratio (INR) based on
the Prothrombin Time (PT) assay carried out in the microINR Chip and displays the International
Normalized Ratio (INR) on the screen.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
microINR System
2. Specimen Identification:
Manual entering of patient identification
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The microINR Chip is intended for single-use only. Once the Chip is inserted into the device,
a drop of fresh capillary whole blood sample collected by fingerstick is manually applied to
the Chip and analyzed by the microINR Meter.
4. Calibration:
Each lot of microINR Chips is calibrated to a reference lot of human recombinant
thromboplastin traced to International Reference Thromboplastin of the World Health
Organization.
These calibration parameters (International Sensitivity Index (ISI) and Mean Normal
Prothrombin Time (MNPT)) are encoded in the printed Datamatrix of each microINR Chip
along with information related to expiration date. Therefore, every test is automatically and
individually calibrated eliminating risk of human error.
5. Quality Control:
The microINR System provides both the Meter´s functional Quality Controls and On-Board
Quality Controls.
First, Meter performance is automatically checked for electronic components, correct power
battery level and environmental temperature conditions.
Then, On-Board Controls provide a quality control check for each individual microINR Chip
used with the microINR Meter. The microINR System has been designed to detect errors
prior to and during the test in order to prevent inaccurate INR results through a multi-level
strategy.

A Home Use (self-testing) Study was performed at four point-of-care (POC) sites, where a
total of 117 eligible subjects (patients stabilized on warfarin therapy and 18 years of age and
older) were enrolled. The home use study was conducted with two microINR Meters per site
and one lot of microINR Chips. Enrolled patients visited the POC site twice. At each visit,
enrolled patients and the health care professionals alternately performed duplicate
measurements. In addition, a venipuncture was performed at the second visit for INR
determinations on the reference laboratory method (ACL TOP 500 with HemosIL
RecombiPlasTin 2G) and the hematocrit assessment. The results obtained by trained users
were compared with those obtained by health care professionals as well as the reference
laboratory method. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed to assess the accuracy
of the microINR measurements obtained by patients against results obtained by the health
care professionals and the results from the reference laboratory method. All results met the
pre-defined acceptance criteria.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
The On-Board Quality Control (QC) System of the microINR System was validated for
analyzing the effect of short sample application and different incorrect sample application
methods including sample perturbation and intermittent applications. For each tested condition,
clinical samples were collected to test the microINR System performance. A total of 55 fresh
venous whole blood samples were obtained from 18 normal subjects and 37 patients under
vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy with INR ≤ 4.5. Immediately after sample collection, the
hematocrit level of patients was measured using the Mission Plus Hb Hemoglobin Testing
System. The INR value was determined by the CoaguChek XS System to classify the samples in
the required INR ranges.
To assess short sample detection, blood samples with different reduced volumes were measured
on the microINR System.
A sample perturbation study was performed to assess the effect of potentially reducing the
volume of the applied sample. The remnant of the drop was absorbed using a piece of paper once
the measurement started.
An intermittent sampling study was conducted by applying a short sample volume to the
microINR Chip, and once the INR measurement began, adding more sample volume before the
