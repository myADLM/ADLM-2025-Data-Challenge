III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The HemoCue® Hb 301 System is intended for quantitative determination of hemoglobin in
primary care or blood donation settings.
The HemoCue® Hb 301 System is intended to be used to determine the hemoglobin
concentration for adults, adolescents, children, and infants above 1 month old in primary care
setting.
The HemoCue® Hb 301 System is intended to be used to determine the hemoglobin
concentration for adults in blood donation setting.
The HemoCue® Hb 301 System is for professional in vitro diagnostic use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The HemoCue Hb 301 System provides a direct reading of the hemoglobin concentration in a
sample using single-use microcuvettes and a photometer (analyzer). The HemoCue Hb 301
System consists of the following components:
• An analyzer supporting the following features:
Photometric determination of hemoglobin
o
Presentation of results on a display
o
• Power supply by power adapter or batteries
• Single use microcuvettes made of polystyrene plastic which do not contain reagents or
active ingredients
B Principle of Operation:
K201217 - Page 2 of 7

--- Page 3 ---
The microcuvette serves both as a pipette and as a measuring cuvette. No dilution or other
preparation of the blood sample is required before filling of the microcuvette. A whole blood
sample of approximately 10 μL is drawn into the cavity in the microcuvette by capillary action.
The measurement takes place in the analyzer, which measures the absorbance of whole blood at
an Hb/HbO2 isosbestic point. The analyzer measures at two wavelengths (506 and 880 nm) in
order to compensate for turbidity. The measurement is performed directly on the whole blood
through measurement of the transmitted and scattered light and using an algorithm for translation
into the hemoglobin concentration of the sample.
The HemoCue Hb 301 System is traceable to the hemiglobincyanide (HiCN) method, the
international reference method according to International Council for Standardization in
Hematology (ICSH) for the determination of the hemoglobin concentration in blood.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
HemoCue® Hb 301 System
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no specimen identification function for the HemoCue Hb 301 system.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The HemoCue 301 microcuvette draws a small amount (approximately 10μL) of venous or
capillary blood by capillary effect. The filled microcuvette is inserted into the microcuvette
holder in the HemoCue Hb 301 analyzer.
4. Calibration:
The HemoCue Hb 301 System is factory calibrated and needs no further calibration.
5. Quality Control:
The HemoCue Hb 301 Analyzer has an internal quality control, a self-test. Every time the
analyzer is turned on, it will automatically verify the system performance. This test is
performed at regular intervals if the analyzer remains switched on.
If an external quality control is required by local or other regulations, commercially available
controls recommended by HemoCue should be used.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
The HemoCue Hb 301 System was previously cleared under K061047 for adults in the primary
care setting and BK060048. The purpose of the current 510(k) submission is to expand the age of
the target population from adults to ≥ 1 month old. The previously submitted analytical
performance studies are documented in K061047 and BK060048.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The sponsor conducted a method comparison study in which 71 venous and capillary
pediatric samples were analyzed on the HemoCue Hb 301 system, HemoCue Hb 801 system,
and reference method ICSH. The reference hemiglobincyanide (HiCN) method used by
HemoCue AB is a manual method set up according to CLSI H15-A3 Reference and Selected
Procedures for the Quantitative Determination of Hemoglobin in Blood; Approved Standard
– Third Edition.
Deming regression analyses were performed to estimate the parameters of the regression
model (i.e. slope, intercept, 95% confidence intervals). The results of this comparison study
are provided in the table below.
