B Indication(s) for Use:
The Psychemedics homogeneous enzyme immunoassay for cocaine in hair is an enzyme
immunoassay for the preliminary qualitative detection of cocaine in human head and body hair
using a cocaine calibrator of 5 ng/10 mg hair for the purpose of identifying cocaine use. This
product is intended exclusively for in-house professional use and not for sale to anyone.
The Psychemedics EIA Cocaine Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. To
confirm positive results, a more specific alternate chemical method (e.g. LC/MS/MS) must be
used. Clinical consideration and professional judgement should be applied to the interpretation of
any drug-of-abuse test result.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The Psychemedics HEIA For Cocaine in Hair assay requires an Automated Clinical Chemistry
Analyzer at 340 nm. The Olympus AU 640 analyzer was used for validation of the candidate
assay.
The confirmation assay uses an AB Sciex 3200 LC/MS/MS linked to two LC-20AD Prominence
Liquid Chromatograph Pump and a LEAP PAL HTC-xt autosampler or a AB Sciex 6500
LC/MS/MS linked to two Shimadzu LC-30AD pumps and a LEAP PAL-HTC-xt autosampler
with a DLW wash system.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Psychemedics homogeneous enzyme immunoassay (HEIA) test for cocaine in hair consists
of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to extract cocaine from the solid hair
matrix to a measurable liquid matrix) and the screening assay, the Psychemedics Cocaine HEIA.
Performance of the HEIA requires a sample extract solution and cocaine-glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) conjugate. The Psychemedics Cocaine HEIA consists of reagents R1
(anti-cocaine monoclonal antibody with substrate) and R2 (cocaine labeled recombinant
G6PDH).
The confirmation assay consists of an AB Sciex 3200 LC/MS/MS linked to two LC-20AD
Prominence Liquid Chromatograph Pump and a LEAP PAL HTC-xt autosampler or a AB Sciex
6500 LC/MS/MS linked to two Shimadzu LC-30AD pumps and a LEAP PAL-HTC-xt
autosampler with a DLW wash system.
B Principle of Operation:
Hair sample extracts are combined with antibody and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PDH)-cocaine immunoconjugate in a cuvette in a clinical chemistry analyzer. The assay is
K201228 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
based on competition between the cocaine-labeled G6PDH and free drug from the extracted hair
sample for a fixed amount of specific antibody binding sites. Int the absence of free drug from
the samples, the specific antibody binds the cocaine-G6PDH and causes a decrease in enzyme
activity. This phenomenon creates a direct relationship between the drug concentration in hair
and enzyme activity. The enzyme activity is determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by
measuring the conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.
For samples that are presumptive positive by the screening assay, a new aliquot of the hair
sample is weighed, washed extensively to remove externally derived cocaine, extracted by a
different procedure and confirmed by LC/MS/MS for the presence of cocaine.

2. Linearity:
The screening immunoassay is a qualitative test only; therefore, a linearity evaluation is not
applicable.
Linearity of the LC-MS/MS confirmation method
The linearity of the confirmation method was evaluated by spiking cocaine and cocaine
metabolites into negative hair. The following concentrations were analyzed in replicates of 5
for each analyte: 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 50, 100 and 150 ng cocaine per 10 mg hair;
0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 50 and 100 ng benzoylecgonine, cocaethylene and norcocaine

Immunoassay: Cross-reactivity with structurally related compounds
Hair samples (8 mg each) were spiked with the compounds listed in the tables below.
Compounds that are potentially unlikely to cross-react were tested in duplicate at
concentrations of 100 ng/10 mg hair. Potentially cross-reacting compounds were tested
individually in duplicate up to concentrations of 1000 ng/10 mg hair. The samples were then
extracted and analyzed by the assay device, followed by comparison to results from the
cutoff calibrator. For structurally related compounds that were expected to show cross-
reactivity, additional concentrations were tested to determine the concentration that is
equivalent to the cutoff shown in the 1st table below. Compounds that did not show cross-
reactivity are shown in the 2nd table below.

Immunoassay: Effect of cosmetic treatments
Ten cocaine-negative head hair samples were treated with perm, dye, shampoo and relaxer
and the results compared to the same samples without treatments. Seven cocaine-positive head
hair samples were treated with perm, dye, shampoo and relaxer and the results compared to
the same samples without the treatments. All of the positive samples were previously
analyzed by the confirmation procedure for cocaine. After the treatments these samples and an
aliquot of the same hair samples untreated were extracted for cocaine analysis and then
assayed by the HEIA cocaine assay. The EIA results with and without treatment are compared

to detect interference in the assay or loss of drug due to the treatments. In each case of the 10
negative samples treated with a type of cosmetic product, all samples remained negative
before and after the treatments. In each case of the 7 cocaine positive samples treated with a
type of cosmetic product, all samples remained positive before and after the treatments.
Specificity of the LC-MS/MS method
An interference study was conducted for the LC-MS/MS method by spiking potential
interferents into hair specimens containing cocaine and cocaine metabolites, and the results
were compared to hair specimens containing cocaine and cocaine metabolites without
potential interferent. All of the samples spiked with the potential interfering compounds and
cocaine (2 ng/10 mg hair) and cocaine metabolites (Benzoylecgonine, Cocaethylene,
Norcocaine each at 0.2 ng/10 mg hair and Para-hydroxycocaine, Meta-hydroxycocaine,
Ortho-hydroxycocaine each at 0.4pg/mg hair) produced a concentration within ± 20% of the
target value. The sponsor concluded that the potentially interfering compounds listed below
did not cross-react or cause interference with the LC-MS/MS assay.
Interferents tested at 20 ng/10mg hair: Clonazepam, Estazolam, Flurazepam,
Flunitrazepam, Midazolam, Nitrazepam, Prazepam, Triazolam, Zolpidem, Phentermine, R,R-

4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable. The screening immunoassay is a qualitative test only.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The cocaine calibrator is traceable to a commercial standard with a certified reference
material Certificate of Analysis.
K201228 - Page 10 of 13

Sample Storage and Shipping Stability:
Five hair samples containing cocaine were stored in the same collection foil and card-
envelope provided with the hair collection kit. After a period of 5 months, the samples were
shipped overnight to another location and returned to the original location by overnight
shipping. Samples were tested by the routine LC-MS/MS procedure both before being
shipped and after their return. The sponsor stated that all samples that tested positive via the
HEIA device and confirmed positive via LC-MS/MS before shipping and storage remained
positive after shipping and storage.
6. Detection Limit:
The screening immunoassay is a qualitative test only; therefore, a detection limit evaluation
is not applicable. See section VII.A.1. above for sensitivity around the immunoassay device
cutoff.
Detection Limit of the LC-MS/MS method
The sponsor performed a study to determine the Lower limit of Quantitation (LLOQ) of the
LC-MS/MS assay for cocaine and cocaine metabolites.
The LLOQ is the lowest claimed concentration that can be quantitated within 20% of the
expected value for COC, BE, CE and NCOC, and within ± 25% for p-OHCOC, m-OHCOC,
o-OHCOC . This was found to be 0.25 ng/10 mg hair for COC, BE, CE and NCOC and 0.4
pg/mg hair for p-OHCOC, m-OHCOC, and o-OHCOC.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in precision
section VII.A.1 above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
