IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Procise CRP is used to measure CRP level in human serum. The Procise CRP assay system
includes the Procise CRP Assay Kit, ProciseDx Calibration Cartridge, and the ProciseDx
Analyzer. Each Procise CRP Assay Kit includes Procise CRP reagent cartridges, buffer bulbs,
and Procise CRP low and high assay controls as follows.
• Twenty pouched Procise CRP reagent cartridges for single use
• Twenty buffer bulbs
• Two pouched Low assay controls (~ 8mg/L)
• Two pouched High assay controls (~ 45 mg/L)
• Product Insert
The ProciseDx Analyzer is a benchtop instrument designed to test the Procise CRP assay.
B Principle of Operation:
The Procise CRP assay is a homogeneous assay that uses a fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) signal to detect the presence and quantity of CRP. FRET is a process in which a
donor molecule, in an excited state, transfers excitation energy to an acceptor fluorophore when
K201256 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
the two are brought into close proximity. Upon excitation at a characteristic wavelength, the
energy absorbed by the donor is transferred to the acceptor, which in turn emits light energy. The
level of light emitted from the acceptor fluorophore is directly proportional to the degree of
donor/acceptor complex formation.
The Procise CRP assay format is designed as a competitive format. A monoclonal anti-CRP
antibody and exogenous CRP antigen are labeled with donor and acceptor fluorophores,
respectively. The monoclonal antibody specific for CRP is labelled with the donor fluorophores
and the CRP antigen is labelled with the acceptor fluorophore. Similar to other competitive assay
formats, as the concentration of CRP increases a proportional decrease in the signal is observed.
Blood specimens are collected by venipuncture and allowed to clot. The serum is collected from
the clotted blood specimen, and the sample, buffer, and assay chemistry are mixed in a cartridge
and loaded into the analyzer. The concentration of CRP is measured by the analyzer.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
ProciseDx Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
It is recommended that the sample is collected in a barcoded serum collection tube. When the
sample has been loaded into the cartridge, the collection tube barcode may be scanned into
the Sample ID field on the analyzer as described in Specimen Sampling and Handling (#3)
below. Alternatively, the Sample ID may be entered manually by using the touch keyboard
on the screen.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A manual precision pipette is used to dispense 20 μL of sample into the cartridge. The
operator obtains a sample, adds the 1.0 mL buffer included in the kit and sample to the
cartridge, and inverts the cartridge multiple times to mix sample buffer and reagents. The
operator then enters the Operator ID and the Patient ID. Entry may be performed by scanning
a barcode on the sample tube or by using the touch keyboard on the screen. When input is
complete, the operator presses run and inserts the cartridge when prompted. When a cartridge
is inserted in the analyzer, the cartridge barcode is automatically read and this determines the
appropriate assay method and associated assay parameters.
4. Calibration:
Calibration check must be completed at least once every 30 days using ProciseDx Calibration
Cartridge. The calibration function is selected from the main menu and the operator enters
their User ID, either by scanning a barcode or by using the touch keyboard on the screen. The
operator presses run and inserts the Calibration Cartridge when prompted. The Pass/Fail
result will be displayed automatically.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a. Within-Laboratory Precision:
The within-laboratory precision of the Procise CRP was evaluated based on CLSI
guideline EP05-A3. A panel of six serum samples was tested in duplicates per run, two
runs per day for 20 days using two reagent lots on two analyzers (each lot per each
analyzer). Each sample was tested to generate a total of 160 test results (2 replicates x 2
runs x 20 days x 2 lots = 160). The total SD and CV% calculation was based on the
within-run, between-run, between-day, and between-lot data. The results are shown in the
table below.

b. Site-to-Site Reproducibility:
The reproducibility study of the Procise CRP was conducted at three different sites using
five serum samples (three patients and two QCs) with different CRP concentrations
across the measuring interval. Within-run, between-run, between-day, between-
operator/instrument and site-to-site reproducibility were evaluated. The SDs and %CVs
for each sample were calculated based on 180 determinations per sample performed with
three replicates per run, two runs per day for five different days on two
operators/instruments at three test sites using a single reagent lot (3 replicates x 2 runs x 5
days x 2 instruments x 3 sites = 180). The results are shown in the table below.

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the Procise CRP was evaluated by testing a series of 11 dilution levels
prepared evenly covering the CRP concentration range of 3.6 to 161.0 mg/L by pooling the
high and low human serum samples. Each sample dilution was measured in one run with
three or four replicates; the mean of the three replicates or four replicates was calculated for
each sample. Linear regression analysis was performed based on expected value vs observed
CRP value. The linear regression results for nine samples within the measuring interval are
shown in the table below.
Slope Intercept
Range (mg/L) R 2 Bias (%)
(95%CI) (95% CI)
0.99 0.05
3.6 – 161.0 1.00 -3.3 – 8.1
(0.97 – 1.00) (-0.94 – 1.05)
The results support the linearity of the claimed analytical measuring range for the Procise
CRP: 5.0 – 150 mg/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To investigate the performance of the Procise CRP with presence of potential endogenous
and exogenous interferents, three pooled human serum samples with various CRP
concentrations (12.3, 52.9, and 89.7 mg/L) were prepared and spiked with potential
interfering substances. The CRP level in the test samples was measured in three replicates
and the %bias in relation to the unspiked sample without interferent was calculated. The
acceptance criterion: No significant interference (%bias < 10%), was observed at the
concentration of the potential interfering substances shown in the table below.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay reportable range of the Procise CRP is 5 to 150 mg/L.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The calibrators are traceable against ERM-DA474/IFCC.
Stability:
Shelf-Life Stability: The real-time reagent stability at ambient room temperatures was
evaluated by testing three serum samples (~5, ~50, and ~100 mg/L) in six replicates each,
using two lots of the Procise CRP stored at 15°C, 23°C, and 30°C up to 26 months. The
results support that the Procise CRP is stable for 24 months at ambient room temperatures of
15–30°C.
The reagent stability for long-term storage was evaluated by testing ten native and three
pooled human serum samples with CRP concentrations ranged 5.0 to 73.3 mg/L, using two
reagent lots stored at -80°C. The results support that the Procise CPR is stable for up to 24
months at -80°C. The long-term stability evaluation is ongoing.
Shipping Stability: The shipping stability was evaluated by testing two serum samples with
CRP concentrations around 5 and 50 mg/L, using four pouched Procise CRP Assay kits, each
containing 20 Procise CRP cartridges (reagent), 20 buffer bulbs, and 2 pouches of assay
controls (low and high). The packed Procise CRP Assay Kits were placed at 38°C for 72
hours and then at 60°C for 6 hours followed by a stress test in a sequence of compression,
random vibration, drop (in carton), random vibration, low pressure, and a bubble test. The
Procise CPR reagent is stable for up to 72 hours at 38°C followed by 6 hours at 60°C under
the simulated shipping conditions.
Calibration Stability: Stability of the calibration cartridge was evaluated on ProciseDx
Analyzer by testing six calibration cartridges stored at 23°C after an initial calibration. The
CRP calibration cartridge is stable at 23°C for up to 18.5 months.
Sample Stability: CRP in serum is stable for 11 days at 20–25°C, 2 months at 4–8°C, and 3
years at -20°C. (Reference: Use of Anticoagulants in Diagnostic Laboratory Investigations.

6. Detection Limit:
For limit of blank (LoB), a set of four analyte depleted serum samples was investigated using
two reagent lots over three days. Each sample was tested in five replicates per run, one run
per day for three days to reach a total of 60 measurements per reagent lot. LoB was
determined per CLSI EP17-A2. The higher value from both lots was taken for the LoB at 0.9
mg/L. The claimed LoB is 1.1 mg/L.
For limit of detection (LoD), a set of five low level serum samples in the range below the
measuring interval was investigated using two reagent lots. Each sample was tested in four
replicates per run, one run per day for three days to reach a total of 60 measurements per
reagent lot. The LoD was determined per CLSI EP17-A2. The higher value from both lots
was taken for the LoD at 1.5 mg/L.
For limit of quantitation (LoQ), a set of five low measurand content serum samples from the
lower end of the measuring interval was investigated. Each sample was tested in four
replicates per run, one run per day for three days using two lots to reach a total of 24
measurements. The LoQ was determined as 2.0 mg/L following CLSI EP17-A2, the sample
with the highest value for the %CV in accordance with the specification for both reagent lots
(< 20%). The claimed LoQ is 5.0 mg/L.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
See below for Expected Values/Reference Range
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
The ProciseDx Analyzer accuracy was evaluated using ERM-DA474/IFCC that was serially
diluted with CRP-depleted human serum for preparation of 11 dilution levels, ranging 1.0 to
41.2 mg/L CRP. Each diluted serum sample was tested in three replicates while the original
ERM-DA474/IFCC (highest concentration) was tested in six replicates. The recovery for all
samples was within 100±10% from the expected values based on dilutions of ERM-
DA474/IFCC.
9. Carry-Over:
Not applicable, the Procise CRP cartridge is single use.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A total of 81 serum samples spanning the assay measuring interval were tested by both the
Procise CRP and a comparator (Orion QuikRead go CRP). Measurement comparison
between these two assays was evaluated using Passing-Bablok regression analysis and the
result is shown in the table below. At the medical decision point of 5.0 mg/L, the calculated
bias was 2.7%.
