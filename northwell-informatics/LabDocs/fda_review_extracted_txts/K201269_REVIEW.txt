III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Accula Strep A Test performed on the Accula Dock is a molecular in vitro diagnostic test
utilizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and lateral flow technologies for the qualitative, visual
detection of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus, Strep A) bacterial
nucleic acid. It is intended to aid in the rapid diagnosis of Group A Streptococcus bacterial
infections from throat swabs of patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis.
All negative test results should be confirmed by bacterial culture because negative results do not
preclude infection with Group A Streptococcus and should not be used as the sole basis for
treatment.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Additional follow-up testing by culture is required if the Accula Strep A result is negative and
clinical symptoms persist, or in the event of an outbreak of acute rheumatic fever (ARF).
D Special Instrument Requirements:
To be used only with the Accula Dock Instrument
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Accula Strep A Test is a semi-automated, colorimetric polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
nucleic acid amplification test to qualitatively detect Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A β-
hemolytic Streptococcus, Strep A) bacterial nucleic acid from unprocessed throat swabs that
have not undergone prior nucleic acid extraction. The system integrates nucleic acid extraction, a
novel Mesa Biotech PCR nucleic acid amplification technology, and hybridization-based visual
detection into a completely self-contained and automated system. The Accula Strep A system
consists of a small reusable Dock to drive the automated testing process, and a single-use
disposable test cassette that contains all the enzymes and reagents.
B Principle of Operation:
Upon insertion of an Accula Strep A Test cassette, the dock will detect and identify the cassette
type. After the user transfers a clinical sample into the cassette and closes the dock lid, the
embedded firmware will control fluid flow of the sample into the various chambers of the
cassette.
Amplicon detection requires the hybridization of two internal probes to generate a signal on the
Accula Strep A detection strip. Dyed polystyrene microspheres are conjugated to oligonucleotide
probes to form an amplicon-microsphere complex by hybridization to an internal region of the
K201269 - Page 2 of 19

--- Page 3 ---
amplicon. The complex migrates through the pores of the detection strip membrane and across
capture zones which contain oligonucleotides complementary to an amplicon region distinct
from the detection probe binding site. Hybridization of the amplicon-microsphere complex to a
capture zone probe retards the flow of the specific amplicon. This allows for the generation of a
visible signal in the form of a colored line at the capture zone.
Interpretation of results:
Results are interpreted visually by the operator after the test has completed. The appearance of
any shade of blue at the “Strep” position on the test strip indicates a valid result that is
interpreted as positive for Strep A. A positive control (“C”) line at the beginning of the strip tests
for amplification effectiveness and is necessary to interpret a test as “negative” for Strep A. A
negative control (“NC”) line at the end of the test strip controls for non-specific binding or
amplification and must be absent for a valid result.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility / Near the Cut-off Study
To demonstrate the reproducibility of the Accula Strep A Test, a panel of contrived throat
swabs were tested at three CLIA-waived sites by two non-laboratory operators at each site.
The nine-member panel consisted of triplicate swab preparations spiked with varying Strep A
concentrations, described in Table 1: low positive (~1X LoD), moderate positive (~2X LoD),
and negative (no Strep A). Each positive sample was prepared by spiking Streptococcus
pyogenes (BAA-946), diluted into a pooled negative throat swab matrix prepared with Strep
A buffer (PNTS), onto a swab. The negative sample consisted of the PNTS alone. Each
operator tested the coded, randomized panel on 5 non-consecutive days over a period of two
weeks (3 sites x 2 operators x 3 replicate swabs x 5 days = 90 results/panel member).

system errors). After retesting, one invalid result remained unresolved (1/290 = 0.3%).
Agreement between observed and expected results was acceptable (>95%). No significant
differences were observed within run (replicates tested by one operator), between runs
(across five days), between operators or between sites.
Within-Laboratory Repeatability
To demonstrate the reproducibility of the Accula Strep A Test within the laboratory, a panel
of contrived throat swabs (Table 1) were tested at an internal site by two operators using
three lots of reagents over ten days. In addition, each operator used a set of dedicated Accula
Docks (18 each). On each testing day, each operator performed three runs (one with each
reagent lot) in two technical replicates (i.e., one swab eluant used for two tests) for each
panel member (2 operators x 3 reagent lots x 2 replicate tests x 10 days = 120 results/panel
member).
Results are reported as percent agreement: observed result/expected result x 100. Agreement
is summarized in Table 3. Reproducibility evaluated by operator, day, reagent lot and Accula
Dock was acceptable (>95%).

2. Linearity/Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable
3. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Quality Control:
The Accula Strep A Test incorporates four controls:
• Internal Positive Control: The positive control line, “C”, is for detection of positive
control DNA (plant gene segment rbcL) that is present in the cassette. It monitors
nucleic acid amplification and detection, as well as the automated testing process and
performance of the Accula Dock. Detection of the internal positive control is not
required for considering a positive test result as valid but is required for considering a
negative test result as valid.
• Internal Negative Control: The negative control line, “NC”, is for detection of
nonspecific hybridization between labeled latex particles and capture probes
immobilized onto the membrane. It monitors improper hybridization artifacts, which
can result from faulty fluid movement, mixing, or rehydration of dyed latex particles.
The absence of signal at the negative control line is required for a valid test.

• External Positive Control: The external positive control swab is provided with the
Accula Strep A Test. It contains inactivated S. pyogenes to monitor nucleic acid
extraction, amplification and detection.
• External Negative Control: The external negative control swab is provided with the
Accula Strep A Test. It contains a dried buffer solution without S. pyogenes.
The external controls are recommended to verify reagent integrity when a new lot or new
shipment of Accula Strep A kits is received, or once for each untrained operator.
Evaluation of Control Performance:
During the Clinical Study to validate performance of the Accula Strep A Test, 2-3 contrived
control swabs were tested by the intended user each day participants were enrolled in the
study. Users were blinded as to the identity of the contrived control samples being tested.
The performance when testing the positive and negative control swabs was acceptable
(>95%), as shown in Table 4.

1Sixty-nine (7.5%) of the 917 control swabs tested did not yield an invalid result after
initial testing (34 invalid results and 35 system errors). After re-testing, seven results
(4 invalid results and 3 system errors) remained unresolved (7/986 = 0.7%).
Sample Stability:
The IFU for the Accula Strep A Test states that a direct throat swab can be stored in its
original packaging at room temperature (15°C to 30°C) for up to 2 hours or refrigerated (2°C
- 8°C) for 24 hours prior to testing. In addition, after elution with Strep A buffer, samples
may be stored at 15°C to 30°C (room temperature) for up to one hour prior to testing. To
evaluate sample stability, ~2X LoD Strep A contrived specimens (or PNTS alone) were
spiked onto swabs and held at 15-30°C and 2-8°C. Additionally, to evaluate stability of the
eluate, ~2X LoD Strep A contrived specimens were spiked onto swabs and eluted with PNTS
and held at 15-30°C, 2-8°C, -20°C, -90°C to -60°C, or for three freeze-thaw cycles at -20°C.
Samples were tested at multiple time points depending on the storage temperature.
Sample storage conditions and test results are summarized in Table 5.

three freeze/thaw cycles at -20°C.
The swab samples yielded the expected test results after being held for: 24 hours at 15-30°C
(room temperature) and 24 hours at 2-8°C.
4. Analytical Sensitivity (Detection of Limit):
The limit of detection (LoD) of the Accula Strep A Test is the concentration at which ≥ 95%
of samples with the Strep A target yield positive results. The LoD was determined by testing
two Strep A strains (BAA-946 and ATCC 19615) that were serially diluted into a pooled
negative throat sample matrix and spiked onto a swab.
A range-finding study was first conducted to establish the lower limit of analytical sensitivity
using 2-fold bacterial dilutions tested in five replicates. Bacterial concentrations which
produced ≥ 4/5 positive results were tested in twenty replicates across multiple days with
multiple reagent lots. If the dilution tested did not result in at least 19/20 positive results, a
two-fold higher concentration was tested again with twenty replicates. The final bacteria
amount at which ≥ 95% of results were positive for the Strep A target is the LoD and ranged
from 25 – 188 CFU (10 – 75 CFU/mL; Table 6):

5. Analytical Sensitivity (Inclusivity):
Wet testing - The analytical reactivity of the Accula Strep A Test was evaluated with four
strains of S. pyogenes that were not evaluated in the LoD study. Each strain was tested in
triplicate at 1.5X LoD and 3X LoD, based on the LoD determine for Strep A strain BAA-946
(75 CFU/mL). Contrived samples were prepared by diluting bacteria into a pooled negative
throat sample matrix and spiking onto a swab. Each strain at 3X LoD was detected 100%
(3/3) with the Accula Strep A Test (Table 7).

In silico analysis - An in silico evaluation was performed to assess the predicted reactivity of
the Accula Strep A Test with a broad spectrum of S. pyogenes isolates. A screen of the NCBI
nt database with Accula Strep A Test primer and probes sequences with stringent search
criteria (allowing no more than 2 mismatches in the primers and enforcing perfect homology
for 6 nucleotides in primer 3’ ends) resulted in 272 hits, all of which were S. pyogenes whole
genome sequences. In addition, when querying the 276 S. pyogenes whole genome sequences
(including duplicate sequences) retrieved from a NCBI search (“Streptococcus pyogenes”
[Organism] AND “complete genome” [All Fields]), 272 sequences were again identified that
met the stringent search criteria. The four entries that failed to meet the search criteria
represented two S. pyogenes genomes (due to the presence of duplicate sequences in the
database) that were isolated from skin or skin/soft tissue infection; neither isolate was
associated with Streptococcal throat infection. Therefore, the primers and probes of the
Accula Strep A Test are conserved across different strains of S. pyogenes.
6. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical Exclusivity/Cross-reactivity
Wet testing - To evaluate potential cross-reactivity of the Accula Strep A Test, analytical
specificity was evaluated by testing 47 potentially cross-reactive microorganisms (Table 8).
Each microorganism was initially tested in triplicate at ≥ 106 CFU/mL for bacteria and yeast
and ≥ 106 TCID50/mL for viruses in the absence of Strep A.

Interference with the Accula Strep A Test was evaluated by testing the same 47
microorganisms, in triplicate, in the presence of Strep A strain BAA-946 at 3X LoD. As a
positive control, 3X LoD Strep A strain BAA-946 was tested in the absence of potentially
cross-reacting organisms. A summary of the analytical specificity study is provided in Table
8.

1 Escherichia coli was originally tested at 2 x 107 CFU/mL and gave the expected 0/3 positive results in the
absence of Strep A but 2/3 positive results in the presence of Strep A. No cross-reactivity was observed at 1
x 107 CFU/mL.
2 Rhinovirus was tested at 1 x 106 TCID50/mL and gave the expected 0/3 positive results in the absence of
Strep A and 3/3 in the presence of Strep A. However, the visually graded maximum line intensity of “3” was
not observed. No interference with line intensity was observed at a concentration of 5 x 105 TCID50/mL.
Cross-reactivity was not detected in any of the 47 organisms tested with in the Accula Strep
A Test at the levels tested; in the absence of the 3X LoD Strep A strain, all samples were
negative.
In general, 3X LoD Strep A samples were detected in the presence of each potentially cross-
reacting microorganisms tested. Escherichia coli was originally tested at 2 x 107 CFU/mL
and gave the expected 0/3 positive results in the absence of Strep A but 2/3 positive results in
the presence of Strep A suggesting interference of E. coli at this concentration with Strep A
detection. Further dilutions were tested; no cross-reactivity was observed at 1 x 107 CFU/mL.
This is included as a footnote in the device labeling.
Rhinovirus was tested at 1 x 106 TCID50/mL and gave the expected 0/3 positive results in
the absence of Strep A and 3/3 in the presence of Strep A. However, the visually graded
maximum line intensity of “3” was not observed on the test strip with at least one replicate,
suggesting interference of Rhinovirus at this concentration with Strep A detection. Further
dilutions of this virus were tested; no interference with line intensity was observed at a
concentration of 5 x 105 TCID50/mL. This is included as a footnote in the device labeling.
In silico analysis - To evaluate potential cross-reactivity and interference with the Accula
Strep A Test, in silico analyses were performed. Queries of the NCBI nt database allowing
up to 11 mismatches in the Strep A primer sequences while requiring only a single perfect
match at the 3’ end of each primer failed to identify hits other than S. pyogenes strains.
Additional focused queries were performed using local and publicly available databases for
organisms and viruses included in Table 9.

BLASTn results were analyzed to identify any hits predicted to generate a PCR amplicon of
88 to 2000 bases. No database sequences were predicted to generate amplicons. However, of
the databases evaluated, only the non-S. pyogenes Streptococcus spp. database generated hits
that met the search criteria for one primer (reverse). Further evaluation identified an 86%
homology of the reverse primer and 67% homology of the forward primer with S.
dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis sequences. Despite significant homology
with the reverse primer, cross-reactivity and interference studies using high levels of S.
dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis failed to identify any cross-reactivity or interference with
Strep A detection (Table 8). In addition, the forward primer shares 12 bases of homology
with S. canis at the 3’ end. After a single gap, the remaining 33 bases in the 5’ portion shares
almost 88% homology with S. canis. The reverse primer shares less than 36% homology with

S. canis sequence. Experimental testing for S. canis cross-reactivity and interference with
Strep A detection failed to detect any cross-reactivity or interference (Table 8). Therefore,
despite some homology with the primers and probes of the Accula Strep A Test, the presence
of other organisms or viruses are unlikely to cross-react or interfere with Strep A detection.
Interfering Substances
To evaluate substances with the potential to interfere with the performance of the Accula
Strep A Test, samples with and without S. pyogenes (strain BAA-946) were tested in
triplicate with potentially interfering substances. To prepare contrived samples, swabs were
dipped into a liquid sample containing the potential interferent at a concentration likely to be
found in a respiratory sample. Swabs were then eluted into PNTS (prepared with Strep A
buffer). Next, Strep A positive swabs were prepared at a final concentration of 3X LoD (225
CFU/mL) and eluted into the PNTS with or without the potential interferent. Substances
shown to interfere with the detection of Strep A (for positive samples) or the internal control
(IC, for negative samples) were further diluted and re-tested in the presence and absence of
Strep A. The highest concentration that showed no interference (i.e., 3/3 = 100% agreement
with expected results) is shown in Table 10.

1Eucalyptus oil was used in place of Halls Triple Soothing Cough Drops due to a lack of availability. Eucalyptus oil is an
active ingredient in the Halls cough drops.
Expected results were obtained with all potential interferants at the final concentration noted in
Table 10. However, prior to obtaining the final concentration, interference was observed for
some substances at higher concentrations. This is addressed as a footnote in the device labeling
and described below:
• Human blood showed inhibition at 100% concentration for Strep A detection in the
positive sample, but no inhibition at 50% concentration.
• Human blood showed inhibition at 100%, 50% and 25% concentrations for IC detection
in the negative sample, but no inhibition at 12.5% concentration.
• Tums was initially tested with a solution of 1.5 g/mL (1 Tum dissolved into 2.5 mL of
Strep A Buffer). This inhibited all reactions. The Strep A Positive sample was inhibited
when tested with an additional 8x and 32x dilution. No inhibition was observed at a
concentration of 20 mg/mL for the Strep A Positive sample. The Negative Strep A
sample showed inhibition when tested with an additional 8x dilution. No inhibition was
observed at a concentration of 30 mg/mL for the Strep A Negative sample.
• Milk showed inhibition at 100%, 50% and 25% concentrations for Strep A detection in
the positive sample, but no inhibition at 12.5% concentration.
• Milk showed inhibition at the 100% concentration for IC detection in the negative
sample, but no inhibition at 50% concentration.
• Orange juice showed inhibition at 100% concentration for detection of Strep A in the
positive sample, but no inhibition at 50%.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The performance of the Accula Strep A Test was evaluated in a prospective, multi-center
study conducted at nine point of care (POC; e.g., physician office laboratory, urgent care,
outpatient clinics) investigational sites representative of a CLIA-waived environment in the
United States between May 2019 and January 2020. Fresh throat swab specimens were
collected from patients with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis: pharyngeal pain (sore
throat), tonsillar swelling with exudates, pharyngeal erythema (reddened throat), tender
cervical lymphadenopathy, or fever. Two throat swab specimens were collected from each
participant: one Copan FLOQswab for use with the Accula Strep A Test and one Copan
eSwab Liquid Amies Collection System for concurrent testing by Blood Agar culture and an
FDA-cleared molecular assay.
Swab specimens were tested with the Accula Strep A Test on the same days as collection by
non-laboratory health professionals who are representative of typical intended use operators
(e.g., nurses, physician assistants, medical assistants) in POC locations. eSwab Liquid Amies
samples used for comparator testing were stored refrigerated and shipped refrigerated to the
reference laboratory within 24 hours of collection. Swabs were used to inoculate Blood Agar
culture plates while swab eluates in Liquid Amies were used for testing with the FDA-
cleared molecular assay.
Table 11 summarizes the number of evaluable results included in the Accula Strep A
performance analysis. Throat swabs were collected from 669 participants; however, only 663
Accula Strep A Test assays were performed due to exclusion of six samples with protocol
deviations or incidents. An additional four samples with unresolved invalid/error Accula
Strep A Test results were excluded from analysis. When using the Blood Agar culture
comparator, an additional five results were excluded from the analysis due to protocol
deviations or incidents, for a total of 654 Accula Strep A Test and Blood Agar culture results
available for analysis. When using the molecular assay comparator, an additional 11 results
were excluded from the analysis (six results excluded due to protocol deviations or incidents,
and five results excluded due to invalid results), for a total of 648 Accula Strep A Test and
molecular assay comparator results available for analysis. All samples with valid Accula
Strep A Test and comparator results are included in the performance analysis. All samples
with discrepant results when compared to either culture or the molecular comparator assay as
well as 10% of samples with non-discrepant results were also tested with a second FDA-
cleared molecular assay.

not generate a result due to system errors caused by the Dock (e.g., cassette failure or misuse,
inappropriate sample volume, or amplification error). After repeat testing of the 56 samples,
seven results (5 invalids and 2 system errors) remained unresolved (7/719 = 1.0%). The
seven samples were tested for a third time; three provided valid results while four remained
