See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The X100 with Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear Application is intended to locate and display
images of white cells, red cells, and platelets acquired from fixed and stained peripheral blood
smears and assists a qualified technologist in conducting a WBC differential, RBC morphology
evaluation, and platelet estimate using those images. For in vitro diagnostic use only. For
professional use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
X100 with Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear (PBS) Application automatically locates and
presents images of blood cells on peripheral smears. The user browses through the imaged smear
to gain high-level general impression. The user reviews the suggested classification of each
white cell according to type and may manually change the suggested classification of any cell.
The user can also characterize red cell morphology on observed images. In addition, the system
suggests the location of platelets. The user reviews each detected platelet and the suggested
platelet estimation and may manually change the detections or the estimation. The Full Field
PBS is intended to be used by skilled users, trained in the use of the device and in the
identification of blood cells.
The Full Field PBS consists of two major components: 1) The X100 Microscope, an optic
scanning unit where sample slides are inserted to the digital microscope for imaging, and 2) The
X100 Scopiobox, an operating and analyzing computer which controls the X100 microscope and
serves the Full Field PBS application.
To acquire a high-resolution image, the sample slide is moved by the X100 microscope
positioning stage under its main optic tube, which has a microscope objective with a tube lens
and high-resolution camera. The X100 microscope captures multiple images of the sample under
a plurality of illumination conditions (different durations, different illumination angles, different
illumination patterns, different wavelengths), without the need for immersion oil. Using a
physical model and the captured images, the X100 Scopiobox reconstructs high-resolution
images of the sample.
B Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
X100 with Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear Application
2. Specimen Identification:
K201301 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
The slide’s barcode is captured automatically and assigned to each case. The device also
supports typing the barcode manually.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A peripheral blood sample collected in K EDTA or K EDTA tubes is mixed manually or
2 3
automatically. A thin blood film is wedged on a clean dry glass slide (a blood smear) and
stained with Romanowsky stain. After the staining process is completed, the slide is covered
using any standard cover slipping method.
4. Calibration:
The Full Field PBS system requires initial calibration for its mechanical and optical
performances. An initial calibration process is performed on a standard blood smear slide as
part of the manufacturing process of the device. The calibration is verified after installation
by a technician or a qualified operator. Calibration can also be performed if a problem arises
in the daily QC testing.
5. Quality Control:
Quality Control (QC) testing is performed on a daily basis (“daily QC”). The daily QC
involves testing a standard blood smear slide prepared on the same day. During the daily QC
the user reviews the images received from the Full Field PBS and verifies that at least 95% of
the WBCs in the scanned image were identified and located correctly by the system. The Full
Field PBS application maintains a digital QC log, enabling the user to review and to track the
history of QC testing performed by the Full Field PBS.

A Method Comparison study was conducted to compare the results achieved by trained
examiners using the X100 with Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear Application (the Test
Method) to the results achieved by using a manual light microscope. The study was
performed according to the CLSI H20-A2: Reference Leukocyte (WBC) Differential Count
(Proportional) and Evaluation of Instrumental Methods; Approved Standard— Second
Edition.
A total of 645 specimens were collected and analyzed at three sites. 335 specimens were
from normal (healthy) subjects and 310 were from subjects with specific disease conditions.
Slides were prepared from each specimen. The slides were randomly selected, blinded and
evaluated by two examiners at each site.
White Blood Cells
Following analysis at each site, a pooled analysis of the multi-center results was conducted.
The following table summarizes the results of the Deming regression comparison method for
the multi-center study. All 95% CI of slope and intercept and Pearson correlation coefficient

Method Comparison Study of 100 to 200 WBC Differential and 5 to 10 FOV Platelet
Estimation
All slides from the Method Comparison study were also analyzed by Full Field PBS device
using 100 WBC differential and 5 FOV platelet estimation. The results were compared to the
200 WBC differential and 10 FOV platelet estimation of the manual light microscope.
Accuracy (Deming Regression), efficiency, sensitivity and specificity were measured.
