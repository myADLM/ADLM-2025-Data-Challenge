B Principle of Operation:
The VITROS® NT-proBNP II Reagent Pack utilizes a one-step immunometric bridging assay
design. A well is pushed from the pack and patient sample is dispensed into the antibody coated
well. The assay reagent and the conjugate reagent are then dispensed into the well with the
patient sample. NT-proBNP present in the sample binds with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
labeled antibody conjugate which is captured by biotinylated anti-NT-proBNP capture antibody
which is bound to streptavidin coated microwells. The well is incubated for 8 minutes, before
unbound materials are removed by washing. The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a
luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrate (a luminol derivative and a
peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound
conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron
transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its
emission. The light signals are read by the instrument. The amount of HRP conjugate bound
and the corresponding signal is directly proportional to the concentration of NT-proBNP present.

† Control Samples
2. Linearity:
The claimed measuring range is 20-30,000 pg/mL. Three (3) reagent master lots of
VITROS® NT-proBNP II Reagent Packs were tested on one VITROS 3600
Immunodiagnostic System. Low and high serum sample pools were prepared and mixed to
produce sample pools with 14 intermediate concentrations. A total of 16 serum samples with
NT-proBNP concentrations ranging from 1.6 pg/mL to 39800 pg/mL were tested in triplicate.
The sponsor performed the analysis recommended in CLSI guideline EP06-A and the results
support that the assay is linear from 20-30,000 pg/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The VITROS® NT-proBNP II Reagent Pack was evaluated for potential interference
following the CLSI EP07 A3 and CLSI EP37 (1st edition) guidelines. Several endogenous
and exogenous compounds were tested with the candidate device in the presence of NT-
proBNP at approximate concentrations of 125 pg/mL and 2000 pg/mL using three master
reagent lots. No interference was defined as a mean percent recovery of samples containing
each interference listed below within 100±10% of control. No interference was observed
with the compounds up to the concentrations listed in the table below.

The interference study demonstrated that cefoxitin sodium and sodium azide interferes with
the VITROS® NT-proBNP II assay. Cefoxitin sodium interfered with the candidate device at
concentrations above 311 mg/dL, which is above the expected therapeutic concentration of
this compound and is therefore not expected to cause significantly interfere with this device.
Sodium azide interfered with the candidate device at concentrations above 85.9 mg/dL.
Sodium azide is a preservative used in some hospital and laboratory equipment that is not
expected to be found in patient samples; therefore, sodium azide is not expected to
significantly interfere with this device. The results are shown below.

The sponsor has the following limitation statements included in the labeling:
• Heterophilic antibodies in serum or plasma samples may cause interference in
immunoassays. These antibodies may be present in blood samples from individuals
regularly exposed to animals or who have been treated with animal serum products.
Results that are inconsistent with clinical observations indicate the need for additional
testing.
• The VITROS® NT-proBNP II test has no high dose hook effect up to a concentration
of 300,000 pg/mL (35,400 pmol/L).
Cross-reactivity in the absence and presence of NT-proBNP: The cross-reactivity of the
VITROS® NT-proBNP II Reagent Pack was evaluated by adding the substances listed in the
tables below to a human serum sample that did not contain NT-proBNP and to a sample
containing NT-proBNP at a concentration of 125 pg/mL. Percent cross-reactivity was
expressed as the mean result obtained for the cross-reactant sample minus the mean result
obtained for the control sample divided by the cross-reactant concentration multiplied by
100. The results showed that the cross-reactivity of proBNP (glycosylated) and proBNP
(nonglycosylated) was greater than 1.0% when tested in samples in which NT-proBNP was
and was not present. Cross-reactivity of NT-proBNP assays to proBNP has been documented
previously. The results of the cross-reactivity testing are presented below.

High dose hook effect:
The VITROS® NT-proBNP II Reagent Pack was evaluated for high dose hook effect using
nine levels of recombinant NT-BNP II. The results support that the VITROS® NT-proBNP
II Reagent Pack does not show a high dose hook effect up to 300,000 pg/mL of NT-proBNP.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Based on the results from linearity and detection limit studies, the sponsor claims an assay
reportable range of 20.0 to 30,000 pg/mL for the VITROS® NT-proBNP II Reagent Pack on
the VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System.
Dilution of high samples:
Serum or plasma (K EDTA or lithium heparin) samples with concentrations up to 41,570
2
pg/mL can be measured after a 10-fold dilution. The percent recovery of diluted samples (up
to 41,570 pg/mL) ranged from 91.5% to 109.6%.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The product calibrators for the VITROS® NT-proBNP II Reagent Pack are traceable to
reference calibrators consisting of recombinant NT-proBNP in citrate buffer that were value
assigned using a commercially available assay. The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products
NT-proBNP II Calibrators are value assigned using the reference calibrators on a lot-to-lot
basis.
Sample Stability:
The sponsor provided data to support sample stability at different temperatures:
• K EDTA plasma, lithium heparin plasma, and serum samples are stable for up to
2
96 hours stored at 68-77°F (20-25°C).
• K EDTA plasma, lithium heparin plasma, and serum samples are stable for up to
2
26 weeks stored at ≤-4°F (≤-20°C).
The sponsor also provided data to support that samples stored frozen at ≤-4°F (≤-20°C) may
be subjected to up to three (3) freeze-thaw cycles.
6. Detection Limit:
The CLSI EP17-A2 guideline was referenced to design the limit of blank (LoB), limit of
detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) studies.
Limit of Blank (LoB):
LoB was determined by running 100 replicates for each of four (4) blank samples consisting
of human serum/buffer matrix fluid over five days, measuring two runs per day, ten
replicates per run, across three lots using the VITROS® NT-proBNP II Reagent Pack on one
VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System. A parametric method was used to evaluate the
data, and the highest value obtained from three lots was claimed.
• The LoB for the VITROS® NT-proBNP II assay is estimated to be 0.034 pg/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
LoD was assessed using seven (7) samples with low levels of NT-proBNP. These samples
were prepared using bulk human serum samples to give approximate target levels in the
range of one to six times the estimated LoB. The LoD was calculated by assaying ten
replicates of each sample, on two runs per day for five days giving a total of 100
determinations of each sample lot. These determinations were run using three VITROS®
NT-proBNP II Reagent Pack master lots on one VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System.
The limit of detection (LoD) for the VITROS® NT-proBNP II assay was determined by
parametric analysis to be 0.46 pg/mL.
• The LoD claimed for the VITROS® NT-proBNP II assay is 0.49 pg/mL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ):
The LoQ was calculated as the lowest concentration of NT-proBNP that can be measured
with a coefficient of variation (CV) of at least 20%. The LoQ was calculated using the seven
K201312 - Page 11 of 32

--- Page 12 ---
sample results from the LoD testing. The % CV for each sample was plotted vs. the mean
concentration of NT-proBNP measured in each sample and a power function model was fit to
the data. The limit of quantitation (LoQ) for the VITROS® NT-proBNP II assay was
determined to be 0.18 pg/mL (highest value obtained from three reagent lots tested). Since
the calculated LoQ is lower than the claimed LoD, the LoQ is set to be equal to LoD at 0.46
pg/mL.
• The sponsor claims the LoQ as 20.0 pg/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
See expected values below.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not Applicable: see clinical studies in Section C.
2. Matrix Comparison:
The sponsor conducted a matrix comparison study to support their matrix claims. 160
unaltered matched serum, K EDTA plasma and lithium heparin plasma samples containing
2
NT-proBNP concentrations from 21.7 pg/mL to 26550 pg/mL were tested. Each serum
sample was tested in duplicate while the lithium heparin plasma and K2-EDTA plasma
samples were assayed in singleton using one VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System. The
results were analyzed using Passing-Bablok regression and Pearson correlation coefficient
(r). The study results support claims for testing serum, K EDTA plasma, and lithium heparin

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Aid in Diagnosis of Heart Failure (HF):
Population 1 Emergency Department (ED):
A multi-center prospective study including 20 collection sites across the United States was
conducted to establish the performance characteristics of the VITROS® NT-proBNP II
Reagent Pack. Subjects 22 years and older presenting to the ED with dyspnea (acute or
worsening) and clinical suspicion of heart failure (HF) were enrolled in the study. Subjects
with terminal kidney failure on chronic dialysis and subjects with dyspnea clearly not
secondary to HF were excluded from the study. The final clinical diagnosis was adjudicated
by independent cardiologists or ED physicians experienced in diagnosing HF. The
VITROS® NT-proBNP II Reagent Pack results were determined from samples collected
from 2200 ED subjects consisting of 1016 (46.18%) female subjects and 1184 (53.82%) male
subjects ranging in age from 22 to 106 years. Individuals in the population were African
American (36.55%) and Caucasian (59.59%), with the remaining 3.86% represented by other
races. Samples were frozen prior to analysis. Data supporting the stability of the samples for
the storage time and condition were provided by the sponsor.
The descriptive statistics for the VITROS® NT-proBNP II Reagent Pack results (pg/mL)
were determined within and across sex by age group and are summarized in the following

The pretest probability of HF (prevalence of HF in the study), posttest probabilities,
likelihood ratios and the two-tailed 95% CIs of the VITROS® NT-proBNP II test result
versus adjudicated diagnosis were determined for the relevant clinical subgroups using the
age-dependent rule-in (450 pg/mL for subjects 22–<50 years old; 900 pg/mL for subjects 50–
<75 years old; 1800 pg/mL for subjects ≥75 years old) and age-independent rule-out (300
pg/mL) cutoffs and are summarized in the following tables:

Population 2 – Outpatient Setting:
The VITROS® NT-proBNP II Reagent Pack results were determined from 777 subjects, 391
females and 386 males ranging in age from 23 to 94 years presenting to cardiology clinics
and other outpatient facilities with a clinical suspicion of HF (not previously diagnosed) and
at least one HF sign, symptom or risk factor at 10 collection sites across the United States.
Subjects with terminal kidney failure on chronic dialysis and subjects with dyspnea clearly
not secondary to HF were excluded from the study. The final clinical diagnosis was
adjudicated by independent cardiologists or ED physicians experienced in diagnosing HF.
Individuals in the population were African American (31.66%) and Caucasian (64.74%),
with the remaining 3.60% represented by other races. The clinical performance and the two-
tailed 95% CIs of the VITROS® NT-proBNP II Reagent Pack results versus adjudicated
diagnosis for subjects presenting to cardiology clinics and other outpatient facilities was
determined using the rule-out cutoff (125 pg/mL) and are summarized in the following

drugs, and renal dysfunction will elevate NT-proBNP levels; obesity, flash pulmonary edema,
cardiac tamponade, and pericardial constriction are conditions associated with reduced NT-
proBNP.
The sponsor included the following statements in their instructions for use concerning the
performance of their device in ED settings in certain clinical subgroups:
• The posttest probability of heart failure in female subjects between the ages of 50 and
<75 with a positive result was low (77.0%). In the study, 23% of female subjects
between the ages of 50 and <75 with a positive test result did not have an adjudicated
diagnosis of heart failure (HF, false positives).
• The posttest probability of heart failure in subjects with no history of HF with a
positive result was low (69.0%). In the study, 31.0% of subjects with no history of HF
who had a positive test result did not have an adjudicated diagnosis of HF (false
positives).
• The posttest probability of not having heart failure in subjects with no history of HF
between the ages of 22 and <50 with a negative result was low (81.8%). In the study,
18.2% of subjects between the ages of 22 and <50 with no history of HF with a
negative test result had an adjudicated diagnosis of HF (false negatives).
• The posttest probability of heart failure in subjects with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2
≥75 years of age with a positive result was low (78.2%). In the study, 21.8% of
subjects with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 ≥75 years of age with a positive test result
did not have an adjudicated diagnosis of HF (false positives).
• The posttest probability of heart failure in subjects with BMI <30 kg/m2 between the
ages of 22 and <50 with a positive test result was low (68.8%). In the study, 31.2% of
subjects with BMI <30 kg/m2 between the ages of 22 and <50 with a positive test
result did not have an adjudicated diagnosis of HF (false positives).
• The posttest probability of heart failure in subjects without Comorbidities (diabetes,
renal insufficiency (eGFR values <60), hypertension (HTN) and/or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) between the ages of 22 and <50 was low
(79.8%). In the study, 20.2% of subjects without comorbidities between the ages of 22
and <50 with a positive test result did not have an adjudicated diagnosis of HF (false
positives).

The sponsor included the following statement in their instructions for use concerning the
performance of their device in outpatient settings:
This test has very low positive predictive value (PPV) in an outpatient population (<23%). In the
study, >77% of patients with a positive result did not have an adjudicated diagnosis of HF (false
positives).
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The reference interval was conducted in accordance with the CLSI EP28 guidance. The
VITROS® NT-proBNP II Reagent Pack reference interval (RI) was established for six
subgroups, based on age and gender from the serum of 385 female and 374 male healthy donors.
The exclusion criteria used to exclude subjects were:
• Current smokers, subjects with cardiac conditions and disease, high blood pressure,
kidney disease, diabetes, cancer within the last five years, stroke, and asthma or other
lung disease within the last five years.
• Subjects who have reported high cholesterol, high triglycerides, thyroid disease, and
females who are pregnant.
• Additional exclusion criteria:
a. Troponin > 99th percentile (> 0.034 ng/mL - VITROS Troponin I ES assay)
b. HbA1c > 6.5%
c. Creatinine (eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min)
Analysis at the 95% confidence level yields the reference ranges shown in the table.
