III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Psychemedics homogeneous enzyme immunoassay (HEIA) for opiates is an enzyme
immunoassay for the preliminary qualitative detection of opiates in human head and body hair
using a morphine calibrator at 2 ng morphine/10 mg hair for the purpose of identifying opiate
use. This is an in vitro diagnostic device intended exclusively for Psychemedics use only and is
not intended for sale to anyone. The Psychemedics homogeneous enzyme immunoassay provides
only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be
used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Liquid Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.
The Psychemedics homogeneous enzyme immunoassay (HEIA) for oxycodone is an enzyme
immunoassay for the preliminary qualitative detection of oxycodone in human head and body
hair using an oxycodone calibrator at 2 ng oxycodone/10 mg hair for the purpose of identifying
opioid use. This is an in vitro diagnostic device intended exclusively for Psychemedics use only
and is not intended for sale to anyone. The Psychemedics homogeneous enzyme immunoassay
provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method
must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Liquid Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
The Psychemedics homogeneous enzyme immunoassay (HEIA) for opiates and homogeneous
enzyme immunoassay (HEIA) for oxycodone combine a screening method (immunoassay) with
a confirmation method (LC/MS/MS) in one test system.
The assay is to be performed only at Psychemedics Corporation.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Performance data for the Psychemedics homogeneous enzyme immunoassay (HEIA) for opiates
in hair and Psychemedics homogeneous enzyme immunoassay (HEIA) for oxycodone in hair
screening assays was collected on the Olympus AU 640 analyzer.
The confirmation assay consists of an AB Sciex 3200 LC/MS/MS linked to two Perkin Elmer
Series 200 Micro pumps and a Perkin Elmer Series 200 autosampler.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The homogeneous enzyme immunoassay (HEIA) test (screening assay) consists of two parts; a
pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to extract opiates from the solid hair matrix to form a
measurable liquid matrix) and the screening assay, the Psychemedics Opiates HEIA and the
Psychemedics Oxycodone HEIA.
The Psychemedics Opiates HEIA consists of reagents R1 (anti-opiates monoclonal antibody with
substrate) and R2 (morphine labeled recombinant G6PDH). The Psychemedics Oxycodone
HEIA consists of reagents R1 (anti-oxycodone monoclonal antibody with substrate) and R2
(oxycodone labeled recombinant G6PDH).
The confirmation assay consists of an AB Sciex 3200 LC/MS/MS linked to two Perkin Elmer
Series 200 Micro pumps and a Perkin Elmer Series 200 autosampler.
B Principle of Operation:
Hair specimens are extracted in a phosphate buffer solution at an acidic pH at high temperature.
After the extraction, the sample is analyzed with opiates antibody and opiate-labeled G6PDH or
oxycodone antibody and oxycodone-labeled G6PDH using a chemistry autoanalyzer. The cutoff
calibrator and controls are also processed through the extraction and autoanalyzer steps.
The immunoassay is based on competition between the morphine-labeled G6PDH or oxycodone-
labeled G6PDH and free drug from the extracted hair sample for a fixed amount of specific
antibody binding sites. In the absence of free drug from the samples, the specific antibody binds
the opiate- G6PDH or oxycodone-G6PDH and causes a decrease in enzyme activity. This
phenomenon creates a direct relationship between the drug concentration in hair and enzyme
activity. The enzyme activity is determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by measuring the
conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.
A change in milli-absorbance units (ΔmAU) greater than or equal to the ΔmAU of the 2 ng
morphine/10 mg hair cutoff calibrator is indicative of the presence of opiates; a change in milli-
absorbance units (ΔmAU) greater than or equal to the ΔmAU of the 2 ng oxycodone/10 mg hair
cutoff calibrator is indicative of the presence of oxycodone.
For samples that are presumptive positive by the screening assay, a new aliquot of the hair
sample is weighed, washed extensively to remove externally derived opioids, extracted by a
different procedure and confirmed by LC/MS/MS for the presence of opioids or oxycodone.

Opiates Immunoassay: Effect of cosmetic treatments
Hair samples negative for opiates and hair samples positive for opiates were
treated with the following cosmetic treatments: permanent wave, relaxer, dye
(which includes bleach), and shampoo. After the treatments these samples and an
aliquot of the same hair samples untreated were extracted for opioids analysis and
assayed by the opiates screening assay. The screening results with and without
treatment were compared to evaluate any interference in the assay or loss of drug
due to the treatments. Fifteen (15) hair samples negative for opiates were
evaluated before and after the following cosmetic treatments: permanent wave,
relaxer, dye (which includes bleach), and shampoo. Nine of the samples were
described as brown, four as dark brown, and two as light brown.
All fifteen of the opiates negative samples produced a negative result both before
and after the cosmetic treatments.
Forty (40) samples (ten for each of the four cosmetic treatments) positive for
opiates were evaluated before and after the following cosmetic treatments:
permanent wave, relaxer, dye (which includes bleach), and shampoo. Thirty-one of
the samples were described as black, seven as brown, and two as salt and pepper.
All forty of the opiates positive samples produced a positive result both before and
after the cosmetic treatments.
Oxycodone Immunoassay: Cross-reactivity with structurally related compounds
The cross-reactivity characteristics of the oxycodone screening immunoassay
were evaluated by spiking various concentrations of potential cross-reactants into
drug-free hair samples and comparing the result to the cutoff calibrator. The table
below lists the percent cross-reactivity and the approximate concentration of each

Oxycodone Immunoassay: Effect of cosmetic treatments
Hair samples negative for oxycodone and samples positive for oxycodone were
treated with the following cosmetic treatments: permanent wave, relaxer, dye
(which includes bleach), and shampoo. After the treatments these samples and
an aliquot of the same hair samples untreated were extracted for analysis and
assayed by the oxycodone screening assay. The screening results with and
without treatment are compared to evaluate any interference in the assay or loss
of drug due to the treatments. The study included 15 negative samples and 10
oxycodone-positive samples with each of the treatments.
Fifteen (15) hair samples negative for oxycodone were evaluated before and
after the following cosmetic treatments: permanent wave, relaxer, dye (which
includes bleach), and shampoo. Nine of the samples were described as brown,
four as dark brown, and two as light brown.
All fifteen of the oxycodone negative samples produced a negative result both
before and after the cosmetic treatments.
Forty (40) samples (ten for each of the four cosmetic treatments) positive for
oxycodone were evaluated before and after the following cosmetic treatments:
permanent wave, relaxer, dye (which includes bleach), and shampoo. Thirty-
one of the samples were described as black, seven as brown, and two as salt and
pepper. All forty of the oxycodone positive samples produced a positive result
both before and after the cosmetic treatments.

Specificity of the LC-MS/MS method
An interference study was conducted for the LC-MS/MS method by spiking
potential interferents into negative hair specimens that did not contain any drug,
and individually into hair specimens containing 0.8 mg/10 mg hair of morphine,
codeine 6-AM, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and oxymorphone.
All of the samples spiked with interferent but no drug produced a negative result
and all of the samples spiked at 0.8 ng / 10 mg hair quantitated at ± 20% of the
target value in the presence of interfering substances. The sponsor concluded
that the potentially interfering compounds listed below did not cross-react or
cause interference with the LC-MS/MS assay.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
An assay reportable range is not applicable for the opiates and oxycodone screening
assays because they are qualitative only.
The claimed reportable range for the analytes measured by the LC-MS/MS method
are as follows:
Morphine: 0.25 ng/10 mg hair to 100 ng/10 mg hair
Codeine, 6-Acetylmorphine, Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone, Oxycodone, and
Oxymorphone: 0.25 ng/10 mg hair to 150 ng/10 mg hair
These reportable ranges are supported by the linearity, precision, and lower limit of
quantitation (LLOQ) studies.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
Calibrators and control materials are prepared using drug stocks purchased from a
commercial vendor with a certificate of analysis. The commercially obtained
stock is made into calibrators and controls to the desired concentrations, which
are confirmed by LC/MS/MS.
Sample shipping and storage stability:
Seven hair samples containing morphine, 6-AM, and codeine and six samples
containing oxycodone and hydrocodone were stored in the same collection foil and
card-envelope provided with the hair collection kit.
After a period of two months, the samples containing morphine, 6-AM, codeine,
and hydrocodone were shipped overnight to another location and returned to the
original location by overnight shipping. Samples were tested by the routine LC-
MS/MS procedure both before being shipped and after their return. The sponsor
stated that all samples that tested positive via the HEIA device and confirmed
positive via LC-MS/MS before shipping and storage remained positive after
shipping and storage.
After a period of four months, the samples containing oxycodone were shipped
overnight to another location and returned to the original location by overnight
shipping. Samples were tested by the routine LC-MS/MS procedure both before
being shipped and after their return. The sponsor stated that all samples that tested
positive via the HEIA device and confirmed positive via LC-MS/MS before
shipping and storage remained positive after shipping and storage.

6. Detection Limit:
The screening immunoassays are qualitative tests only; therefore, a detection limit
evaluation is not applicable. See section VII.A.1. above for performance around
the immunoassay device cutoff.
The sponsor performed a study to determine the lower limit of quantitation
(LLOQ) of the LC-MS/MS assay for morphine, codeine, 6-acetylmorphine,
hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone and oxymorphone.
The LLOQ is the lowest concentration that meets chromatographic and retention
time criteria, and that can be quantitated within 20% of the expected value. The
method LLOQ was determined to be 0.25 ng/10 mg for morphine, codeine, 6-
MAM, oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone and hydromorphone. The LLOQ
for this method has been administratively raised to 0.5 ng/10 mg for codeine,
oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Analytical performance of the devices around the claimed cutoff is described in
precision section VII.A.1 above.
