III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Dexcom G6 System) is a real time,
continuous glucose monitoring device indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 2
years and older.
The Dexcom G6 System is intended to replace fingerstick blood glucose testing for diabetes
treatment decisions. Interpretation of the Dexcom G6 System results should be based on the
glucose trends and several sequential readings over time. The Dexcom G6 System also aids in
the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-
term therapy adjustments.
The Dexcom G6 System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally connected
devices, including automated insulin dosing (AID) systems. The Dexcom G6 System can be used
alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected medical devices for the purpose of
managing diabetes.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
• Remove the Dexcom G6 sensor, transmitter, and receiver before Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat
(diathermy) treatment. The magnetic fields and heat could damage the components of the
Dexcom G6 System, which may cause it to display inaccurate blood glucose readings or may
prevent alerts.
• When wearing the device, ask for hand-wanding or full-body pat-down and visual inspection
instead of going through the Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) body scanner. Also avoid
putting any part of the device through baggage x-ray machine.
• This device is not intended for pregnant women, people on dialysis, or critically ill patients.
• The device should not be used to make diabetes treatment decisions when:
• The user has not used the iCGM before or is unfamiliar with the Dexcom G6 System. (It
may take days, weeks or months for a user to gain confidence in using the iCGM to make
treatment decisions.)
• The user’s symptoms do not match the glucose values displayed by the device.
• The device does not show a glucose value or a trend arrow.
• During the first two hours of sensor warm-up period, the user should use a blood glucose
meter to make treatment decisions.
• The user’s glucose is rising or falling rapidly.
• Although standard dosing of acetaminophen (1000 mg per every 6 hours) does not appear to
cause significant bias, higher supra-therapeutic levels of acetaminophen have shown
significant positive bias.
• Sensor glucose readings will be falsely higher if the user is taking hydroxyurea. Do not use
the device for diabetes treatment decisions when taking hydroxyurea.

--- Page 3 ---
• Adult users should only use the abdomen and pediatric users should only use the buttock or
abdomen. Sensor performance has not been evaluated in other insertion sites and may differ
from expected iCGM performance.
• If a sensor wire breaks or detaches from the sensor, it could remain under the user’s skin. The
user should contact their healthcare practitioner if this occurs.
• The transmitter should not be shared to avoid transmission of bloodborne illnesses.
• When using Bluetooth headphones, speakers, etc., the user's alarm/alerts may sound on the
primary smart device or on the accessory. Each accessory is different. The user should test
their device so that they know where they will hear the alarm/alerts.
• Before updating the smart device hardware or operating system, verify the compatibility of
the updated hardware/software with the device system.
• The software application may not be used in environments not currently cleared for Dexcom
G6 CGM System (e.g. hospital for inpatient care).
• The Partner Web APIs is not intended to be used by automated insulin delivery systems
(AID).
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System uses a subcutaneous glucose
sensor that measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and consists of three main
components: a sensor, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitter and a BLE enabled display
device (receiver and/or mobile application). The user can view glucose data on the receiver or on
the G6 CGM App (i.e., a mobile medical application) running on a compatible mobile device, or
on both simultaneously. An adhesive patch sits on the surface of the skin to position and hold the
sensor, electrical contact elements, and an attachment point for a transmitter, which receives
sensor signals, processes these, and sends glucose information to a dedicated receiver or mobile
app.
G6 CGM SENSOR
The sensor component is a sterile device that consists of the sensor applicator, plastic base
(“transmitter holder”), and sensor probe. The applicator is a single use, disposable unit that
contains an introducer needle holding the sensor probe. The applicator deploys the needle and
inserts the sensor under the skin. The needle is retracted back into the applicator after insertion.
The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and can be
worn for up to 10 days.
G6 CGM TRANSMITTER
The G6 CGM Transmitter is a miniature radio transmitter that incorporates data processing
functionality. The transmitter contains a Bluetooth radio transceiver for communication with a
compatible display device (i.e., receiver and/or smart device). The transmitter attaches to the
sensor and can be re-used for multiple sensing sessions up to three months.
G6 CGM RECEIVER
The G6 CGM Receiver is small hand-held device that wirelessly receives glucose information
from the transmitter every five minutes and includes a touchscreen display. The 5 receiver
displays the current glucose reading and glucose trends to the user. It alerts the user when
glucose levels are outside of a target zone and when other important system conditions occur.
K201328 - Page 3 of 10

--- Page 4 ---
DEXCOM G6 System MOBILE APP
The G6 CGM App for iOS and G6 CGM App for Android provides an alternative display device
to the receiver for users with a compatible, BLE-enabled smart device and behaves similarly to
the receiver. The G6 CGM App is compatible with certain iOS, Android and Smart Device
watches. A link to a list of compatible devices is included in the instructions for use.
The Dexcom G6 System is an interoperable connected device that can communicate glucose
readings and other information wirelessly and securely to and from interoperable electronic
interfaces; including compatible AID systems. The G6 CGM system is designed to communicate
with interoperable devices in several ways, such as described below:
• Wireless communication from the transmitter directly to an interoperable device
communicating through the same protocol.
• The app communicates to another app on a single mobile platform.
• The app communicates through the cloud to another software device
DEXCOM Partner Web APIs
The newly added software component, which consists of cloud-based application programming
interfaces (APIs) enables communication of iCGM data to client software intended to receive
that data through the cloud. The transmitted data can be used by authorized client software for
specific and permitted use cases including non-medical device application, medical device data
analysis, CGM secondary display alarm, active patient monitoring, and treatment decisions. The
Partner Web APIs is not intended to be used by automated insulin delivery systems (AID).
Dexcom display devices (receiver and mobile app) continue to serve as a primary display device
for the (iCGM) data, which directly receives the data from the transmitter. The receiver and/or
mobile app also continues to alert the user when glucose levels are outside of a target zone.
B Principle of Operation:
The Dexcom G6 CGM System uses a subcutaneous sensor to detect glucose levels from the fluid
just beneath the skin (interstitial fluid). The sensor probe continuously measures the glucose
concentration in the interstitial fluid via an enzymatic electrochemical reaction using glucose
oxidase. The enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and produces hydrogen
peroxide. The production of hydrogen peroxide generates an electrical current that is
proportionate to the interstitial glucose concentration. The transmitter converts the signal using
an algorithm to a glucose value read in mg/dL, the data is transmitted to a compatible display
device for display to a user.
