II Review Summary:
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the submitter's own
CLASS II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable.
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER'S previously cleared device. The Oh'Care
Lite Smart Blood Glucose Monitoring System (K182286).
2. Submitter's statement that the INDICATIONS FOR USE/INTENDED USE of the
modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed
labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available,
advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do
not affect the intended use).
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams,
engineering drawings, photographs, user's and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to

demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified
device has not changed. This change was for:
- Change in color and texture of exterior meter housing materials and change in shape of
the meter buttons.
- Dimensions of the meter were changed from 83 x 56 x 18 ±1 (mm) to 81 x 52 x 16±1
(mm).
- The meter weight with batteries changed from 43±1 g to 46±1 g.
- The meter memory capacity was changed from 365 test results to 500 test results.
4. Comparison Information (i.e., similarities and differences) to the submitter's legally marketed
predicate device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics.
5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification
on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation
activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter's description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information
between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific
technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as
specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined
substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
previously performed on the exterior meter materials (k103021) by an outside testing laboratory
demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant
CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA Registration 46781-8). A robustness study was
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external
materials of the meter after 1,095 cleaning and disinfection cycles with the CaviWipes
Disinfecting Towelettes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 3 years of single
patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
