VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:
Special Controls under 21 CFR 866.3920
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
An external site precision study was performed with the NATtrol BD MAX Vaginal Panel
External Run Controls on the BD Max system. The performance of the controls was evaluated by
observing the data collected during multiple studies performed by six (6) operators using two (2)
lots of BV Positive (NATBVPOS-BD), two (2) lots of BV Negative (NATBVNEG-BD), and
one (1) lot of CTV Positive (NATCTVPOS-BD) controls. All controls were added to the BD
Molecular Swab Sample Buffer Tube and processed according to the BD Vaginal Panel Assay
package insert. A total of 381 external controls were tested (86 BV Positive Controls, 104 CTV
Positive Controls, and 191 BV Negatives). The results are shown in the Tables below:

Real-Time Stability Program:
The NATtrol BD MAX Vaginal Panel External Controls stability study is an ongoing study
designed to support a 12-month shelf-life claim at 2-8˚C. Testing is performed at multiple
timepoints within the anticipated shelf-life with an additional test performed at least four (4)
months after the proposed expiration date. The BD MAX Vaginal Panel will be used to test
each control three times at each time point according to the package insert instructions for
use. Acceptance criteria for each test is a positive or negative result for the appropriate
targets at all time points.
The controls were tested using the BD MAX Vaginal Panel with the UVE Sample Buffer
Tube for initial stability testing. Release testing (post dispense and assembly) of each lot
served as the initial time point of the study (T0). For Real-Time Stability, controls in their

final packaging were placed at 2-8°C, and three replicates (n = 3) from three separate tubes
were tested at each time point per the testing methods. All three replicates for each control
produced the same expected result, which is summarized in Table 8.
