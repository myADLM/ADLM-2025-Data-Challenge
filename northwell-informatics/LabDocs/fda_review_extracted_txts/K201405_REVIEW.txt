B Indication(s) for Use:
LabPro Data Management System is a Microsoft Windows based software program and
is intended to manage both microbial identification (ID) and antimicrobial agent
susceptibility testing (AST) data generated from Beckman Coulter instruments or manually
entered microbiology test results, for use by trained laboratory personnel.
LabPro AlertEx is a functional subset of the LabPro Data Management System that
analyzes Beckman Coulter ID and AST data, or other pre-defined parameters, against a series of
established rules/ alerts and notifies the user of unusual, and/or critical conditions, which
may warrant further analysis or action.
LabPro-MBT software is a functional subset of the LabPro Data Management System
intended to electronically transfer and display organism identifications from the Bruker
MALDI BioTyper System to the LabPro Data Management System. LabPro-MBT software
is a device that is intended to electronically transfer medical device data, without controlling
or altering the functions or parameters of any connected medical devices.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The proposed LabPro Data Management System (LPDMS) software device is a system intended
to be used in laboratory settings by trained personnel to manage both microbial identification
(ID) and antimicrobial agent susceptibility testing (AST) data generated from Beckman Coulter
instruments, manually entered data and/or data from select third party microbiology instruments.
The LPDMS consists of two functional subsets. The first subset is The LabPro AlertEx that
analyzes Beckman Coulter ID and AST data against a series of established rules/alerts and
notifies the laboratory user of unusual, and/or critical conditions. The second subset is the
LabPro MBT software that allows for transfer and display of organism identifications from the
Bruker MALDI BioTyper System to the proposed LabPro Data Management System.
