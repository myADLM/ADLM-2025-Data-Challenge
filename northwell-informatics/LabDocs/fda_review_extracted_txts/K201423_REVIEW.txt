II Review Summary:
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the submitter's own
Class II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER'S previously cleared device.
2. Submitter's statement that the INDICATIONS FOR USE/INTENDED USE of the
modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed
labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION was provided in sufficient detail to
demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified
device has not changed. This change was for the addition of Acinetobacter spp. as an
indicated species for testing with meropenem.
4. Comparison Information (i.e., similarities and differences) to the submitter's legally marketed
predicate device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification
on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation
activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter's description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information
between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific
technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as
specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined
substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission referred to the breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA in K192355. This protocol addresses future revisions to device
labeling in response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that Beckman Coulter
intends to use to evaluate the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panels with
Meropenem (Mer) (0.004 - 32 µg/mL) when revised breakpoints for meropenem are published
on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol indicated that if specific criteria are
met, Beckman Coulter will update the meropenem device label to include (1) the new
breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket
notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined by their
evaluation.
