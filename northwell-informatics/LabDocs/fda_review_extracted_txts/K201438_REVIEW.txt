III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The ASI Automated RPR (rapid plasma reagin) Test for Syphilis, for use on the ASI Evolution
Automated Analyzer, is a qualitative and semi-quantitative flocculation test for the detection of
nontreponemal antibodies in human serum and plasma to aid in the diagnosis of syphilis. All
reactive RPR test samples should be further tested with a treponemal test to determine
serological evidence of syphilis infection. The test is intended to be used for in vitro diagnostic
testing.
The ASI Automated RPR Test for Syphilis is for professional use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
ASI Evolution Automated Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ASI Evolution is an integrated digital particle analyzer designed to objectively interpret
certain slide agglutination tests manufactured by Arlington Scientific, Inc. (ASI). The ASI
Evolution fully automates the sample and reagent handling steps of the test procedure, including
fluid handling, mixing, timing, image capture, image processing and result reporting.
The RPR (rapid plasma reagin) Test for Syphilis is sold in two kit sizes, 480 tests and 4800 tests.
Each reagent kit contains RPR Carbon Antigen, three Controls (Reactive, Weak Reactive and
Nonreactive) and 48-well Microwell Plates.
The test uses serum or plasma samples which are loaded directly onto the analyzer along with
microwell plates in the designated area. The instrument automatically dispenses the specified
sample volume and the reagents into the microwells where the reaction occurs. The instrument
can accommodate up to 4 microwell plates and process up to 192 samples, including controls.
K201438 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
The ASI Evolution further provides tools that enable the creation, storage, retrieval and
transmittal of the test results.
B Principle of Operation:
The ASI Evolution employs a camera to create a high-resolution image of an agglutination
immunoassay. The software has been developed with an optical recognition feature capable of
recognizing each well boundary to ensure accurate positioning prior to image capture. The image
is then analyzed by the proprietary software algorithm that interprets the agglutination pattern
based on the number and size of the carbon particles in the image. This count is then compared
to preset parameters to determine the test result. If the value is below the parameter, it is
interpreted as Nonreactive, and if the value is above the parameter, it is interpreted as Reactive.
All images are stored on the hard drive and results are labeled reactive or non-reactive. This
interpretation is then displayed on the User Interface.
Barcode labeled patient samples can be imported with the use of a hand-held barcode scanner. A
printout or file export is provided after the results are determined. The reactive samples can be
batched for determination of titers using another protocol contained in the instrument software.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
ASI Evolution Automated Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Barcode or manual.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Direct from the sample collection tube.
4. Calibration:

To demonstrate the reproducibility of the system after the interpretation algorithm was
modified, a study was conducted testing seven serum samples with a range of RPR titers. The
testing was performed over five testing days using three lots of Carbon Antigen each day.
Each sample was tested in duplicate, in two runs per day for a total of 60 measurements per
sample (5 days x 2 runs/day x 2 replicates x 3 lots of Carbon Antigen). The sample panel
consisted of two nonreactive samples, two samples with a titer of 1:2, one sample with a titer
of 1:4, one sample with a titer of 1:8 and one sample with a titer of 1:16. All tests gave
expected results. A summary of the reproducibility data is shown below.

A comparison of the digital interpretation of results from the ASI Evolution using the
original interpretation algorithm to the interpretation made by the ASI Evolution using the
new interpretation algorithm was conducted by testing 1,762 retrospective samples (872
serum and 890 plasma). All samples were deidentified and the testing was performed over
multiple days by multiple operators, using one lot of Carbon Antigen. Reactive, Weak
Reactive and Nonreactive controls were run on each day of testing. The results are presented
below, by matrix.

There were 12 samples that gave discordant results (6 serum and 6 plasma) between the two
versions of the interpretation algorithm. These samples were tested with the TPPA assay
(treponemal test) as well as with the manual RPR. The results of both treponemal testing and
manual RPR testing were consistent with the results obtained using the modified algorithm, as
shown below.

Additional investigation of the images from the 12 discordant samples revealed the
following:
1. The seven samples that were Reactive by the modified algorithm and Nonreactive by
the original algorithm, were found to be misidentified by the original algorithm due to
the identified “bug” in the software.
2. The five samples that were Reactive by the original algorithm and Nonreactive by the
modified algorithm, were all found to have a bubble or an artifact in the test well,
which was mis-identified by the original algorithm as a “clump.” The image analysis
of the modified interpretation algorithm is able to account for these in the aggregation
totals.
2. Interpretation of Images by the Software
The modified algorithm was evaluated using a bank of well images that have been collected
from multiple ASI Evolution analyzers. The images were passed through the algorithm and
the interpretation result was given as Nonreactive or Reactive. A total of 18,017 images were
passed through the algorithm. These included 8,631 reactive images and 9,386 nonreactive
images. The results were compared to those obtained when tested on the ASI Evolution using

3. Challenge Panel
The interpretation algorithm was further evaluated with 30 clinical samples representing
“challenge” samples. These samples tested Nonreactive with the original algorithm but were
Reactive with a manual RPR test. The archived images of these samples were reassessed
with the new interpretation algorithm and all samples were interpreted as Reactive.
4. Testing of Pregnant Women
Serum samples from pregnant women were tested on the ASI evolution using the modified
interpretation algorithm. The results were compared to the results obtained with the ASI RPR
Card test on the ASiManager-AT. There were 250 specimens with Nonreactive results and 30
specimens with Reactive results. There was 100% agreement between the results obtained
with both test systems.

In order to evaluate the titer functionality of the ASI Automated RPR on the ASI Evolution and
to assess the accuracy of the semiquantitative test procedure, nine samples with known RPR

the ASI Evolution using the modified software. The test panel consisted of the following

Each sample was tested in eight replicates on 10 different days, for a total of 80 data points for
each sample. Acceptance criteria were: (a) all Nonreactive samples must be Nonreactive on the
ASI Evolution, and (b) all Reactive samples must generate a titer result that is within one titer of
the manual RPR titer result. All samples generated expected results, as shown in the table below.
