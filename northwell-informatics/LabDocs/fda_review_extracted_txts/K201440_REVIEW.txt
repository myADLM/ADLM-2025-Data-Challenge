B Indication(s) for Use:
The ROTEM sigma thromboelastometry system is a fully integrated and automated in vitro
diagnostic system designed to monitor and analyze a patient’s coagulation status by measuring
the viscoelastic properties of a 3.2% citrated venous or arterial whole blood sample. The
ROTEM sigma system is indicated for use with adult patients 21 years and older where a semi-
quantitative evaluation of their blood coagulation properties is desired, in the point of care and
laboratory settings. Coagulation evaluations on the ROTEM sigma instrument, together with the
ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridge, are used to assess peri-operative hemorrhage and/or
thrombosis in cardiovascular surgery and liver transplantation.
The single use, multichannel cartridge ROTEM sigma complete + hep contains the following
assays:
INTEM C is a semi-quantitative assay used to monitor coagulation via the intrinsic pathway in
citrated whole blood samples.
EXTEM C is a semi-quantitative assay used to monitor coagulation via the extrinsic pathway in
citrated whole blood samples.
FIBTEM C is a semi-quantitative assay used to monitor coagulation via the extrinsic pathway in
citrated whole blood samples, after blocking platelet contribution to clot firmness.
HEPTEM C is a semi-quantitative assay used to monitor coagulation via the intrinsic pathway in
citrated whole blood samples, after inactivating heparin.
Results from the ROTEM sigma should not be the sole basis for a patient diagnosis; ROTEM
sigma results should be considered along with a clinical assessment of the patient’s condition and
other laboratory tests.
For in vitro Diagnostic use. For professional use only.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ROTEM sigma Thromboelastometry System is an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) whole blood
hemostasis system intended for use in the evaluation of coagulopathies in Point of Care (POC) or
laboratory settings. It uses rotational thromboelastometry to provide semi-quantitative
information about the coagulation state of a blood sample. The ROTEM sigma system records
the kinetic changes in a 3.2% citrated whole blood sample during clot formation, as well as when
the sample clot retracts and/or lyses. Several parameters, including clotting time, clot firmness,
and clot lysis index, are measured and reported for this purpose. The graphical presentation, or
reaction curve (TEMogram) created in real time and displayed along with numerical values of

--- Page 3 ---
associated parameters, reflects the various physiological results, which describe the interaction
between coagulation factors and inhibitors, fibrinogen, platelets, and the fibrinolysis system.
Additionally, the test can detect the effect of anticoagulant heparin on hemostasis.
The ROTEM sigma Thromboelastometry System consists of:
• ROTEM sigma instrument
• ROTEM sigma cartridges
ROTEM sigma complete + hep (with assays INTEM C, EXTEM C, FIBTEM C,
o
HEPTEM C)
• ROTEM sigma system QC (Quality Control) cartridge
• ROTEM sigma controls
ROTEM sigma ROTROL N
o
ROTEM sigma ROTROL P
o
B Principle of Operation:
The ROTEM sigma Thromboelastometry System technology uses rotational thromboelastometry
that is based on a fixed cylindrical cup and an oscillating vertical axis. The axis is supported by a
high precision ball bearing and oscillates through an angle. Oscillation of the axis is driven by a
motor. For the measurement, the channel’s measurement axis engages the plastic pin in the cup
of the disposable heated cartridge holding the blood sample. The oscillation is detected optically.
If no clotting takes place, the pin movement is not restricted. As a clot forms and attaches itself
between the pin and cup surfaces, the pin movement becomes increasingly restricted. As the clot
becomes firmer, the oscillation amplitude of the axis is reduced.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
ROTEM sigma
2. Specimen Identification:
The user can scan information from blood samples and ROTROL vials in the instrument
using the barcode reader.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Blood samples are to be collected in accordance with CLSI GP41: Procedures for the
Collection of Diagnostic Blood Specimen by Venipuncture; Approved Standard - Seventh
Edition.
Samples should be stored at room temperature and not placed on ice. Do not shake or roll
sample tubes. Sample pipetting is automated, and the instrument is capable of cap piercing.
4. Calibration:
The ROTEM sigma instrument is factory calibrated.
5. Quality Control:
Different levels of quality control (QC) are implemented to ensure that the ROTEM sigma
system functions as intended. This includes internal system QC with the ROTEM sigma
system QC cartridge for system functionality testing, and external QC using ROTROL N /
ROTROL P:

--- Page 4 ---
• System QC:
System QC checks the functional integrity of the instrument hardware and should be
performed weekly or according to local regulations. The system QC cartridge is a
cartridge like the assay cartridges, except without needle, reagents, and mixing ball
and with more robust fluidic valves to withstand repeated testing. If the ROTEM
sigma system QC cartridge is not available, any other unused test cartridge can be
used for system QC. In order to ensure the ROTEM sigma is not damaged, it is
important to use a new test cartridge when performing the system QC.
• External QC (EQC) with ROTEM sigma ROTROL N and ROTROL P:
Tests with standardized 2-level quality control (QC) materials (ROTEM sigma
ROTROL N and ROTROL P) are performed to identify potential issues with the
reagents in the ROTEM sigma cartridges. EQC is recommended to be performed on
every new cartridge lot, every new cartridge delivery, and after system
maintenance/repair.

Precision Studies Using Control and Whole Blood – CT, A5, A10, A20, and MCF
To evaluate the precision performance of the new ROTEM sigma instrument and its assays
with ROTROL controls, whole blood samples, and contrived whole blood samples, an
internal repeatability study was performed on three lots of ROTEM sigma complete + hep
cartridges. The control repeatability study involved three lots of each of the controls ROTEM
sigma ROTROL N and ROTEM sigma ROTROL P. The whole blood repeatability study
involved native donor normal whole blood samples and contrived hypocoagulable and
hypercoagulable samples. The control study was run in duplicate, twice a day for 20 days, for
a total of 80 replicates per control, using five instruments and four operators. The whole
blood study was run in triplicate in one day on five instruments, for a total of 15 replicates
per sample type. Due to the sample stability, the whole blood repeatability study was
performed in one day and one run. For each assay type, except for FIBTEM C, the CT, A5,
A10, A20, and MCF parameters were evaluated. CT is not a claimed parameter for FIBTEM
C assay and was not evaluated in the repeatability study. The study mean, total SD and total
%CV for each precision parameter on each instrument were calculated for CT, A5, A10,
A20, and A30 (controls) or MCF (whole blood).
Repeatability Results Summary – CT, A5, A10, A20, and MCF
In the summary tables below, the highest %CV for individual assay parameters from the
repeatability studies using ROTROL N, ROTROL P and whole blood samples on three lots
of cartridges are presented. Overall, the study results demonstrated performance repeatability
of the ROTEM sigma system with respect to measuring CT, A5, A10, A20, and MCF
parameters for control and whole blood samples.

Lysis Precision Study – LI60 and ML
In an internal lysis precision study, the lysis parameters, LI60 and ML, were assessed for the
INTEM C and EXTEM C assays of the ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridge using normal
donor whole blood and abnormal hyperfibrinolysis blood. This study was performed with three
(3) lots of ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridges. One donor per sample type and cartridge
lot was tested on five instruments, with three replicates per instrument (N = 5 instruments x 3
replicates/instrument). Overall, the lysis precision study demonstrated the performance of the
ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridge and the associated assays in measuring the lysis
parameters LI60 and ML. The highest SD and % CV of the three cartridge lots for the parameters
LI60 and ML are summarized below.

Lot-to-Lot Variability Study with Normal Donor Whole Blood.
To assess performance variability between lots of ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridges, a
precision study was conducted using donor whole blood. The study was for five days, with two
runs per day, three replicates per run per cartridge lot. For each run, the same donor sample is
used across all three cartridge lots. Ten different donor samples were used for the five-day study.
Data was analyzed using a two-factor nested ANOVA with donor nested within lot. Overall, the
data shows that similar results can be expected for different cartridge lots when running the same
sample.

Reproducibility
To assess the device’s performance reproducibility, reproducibility studies were performed at
three (3) external point of care sites on one (1) lot of ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridges
using four (4) ROTEM sigma instruments per site and three (3) lots each of the controls ROTEM
sigma ROTROL N and ROTEM sigma ROTROL P. The study was run in triplicate twice a day
for five (5) days, for a total of thirty (30) replicates per control.
Estimates of reproducibility based on the aggregate data were obtained via a three-way nested
ANOVA. The pooled data from three (3) external sites for each control lot are presented below.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference – UF Heparin, LMW Heparin, Tranexamic acid, ε-Aminocaproic acid,
Acetylsalicylic Acid (Aspirin), Ticagrelor, and Lupus Anticoagulant
Interference studies were conducted to assess the interference of UF Heparin, LMW Heparin,
Tranexamic acid, ε-Aminocaproic acid, Acetylsalicylic Acid (Aspirin), Ticagrelor, and lupus
anticoagulant on the ROTEM sigma with each of the sigma assays (INTEM C, EXTEM C,
FIBTEM C, and HEPTEM C). Three interference levels were evaluated (baseline, claim and
greater than claim) for each interference substance. For all interferent except lupus
anticoagulant, normal donor whole blood and abnormal hypocoagulable whole blood were
used. For each interferent and blood sample type, a single pool was prepared from whole
blood from one donor. This pool was distributed evenly into baseline, claim, and above claim
levels. Each level was spiked with the interferent to the desired concentration and evenly
aliquoted. The results of each interferent level were compared to the results at baseline
(normal) level. If the % difference from baseline exceeded the predetermined acceptance
criteria, then interference has occurred.
Another interference study was performed using normal whole blood samples to determine
the impact of lupus anticoagulant on the same assays. Eleven normal whole blood samples
were used. Each donor sample was run on three instruments with one replicate per
instrument. Three interferent levels were tested, including baseline, claim, and greater than
claim as shown in the table below.

Interference – Hematocrit
Whole blood samples with three different hematocrit (Hct) levels (low-23% Hct, normal-
40% Hct and high-55% Hct) were evaluated. The results for low and high hematocrit
samples were compared to the results for normal hematocrit sample. The study results
showed that compared to normal hematocrit samples, low hematocrit samples showed little
change or a shortening of CT and an increase in amplitude parameters (A5, A10, A20, MCF),
while compared to normal hematocrit samples, high hematocrit samples showed a
prolongation of CT and a decrease in amplitude parameters (A5, A10, A20, MCF).

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Shelf-Life Stability
A study was conducted to evaluate the shelf-life stability of the ROTEM sigma complete +
hep cartridge. The study tested three lots of cartridge using normal whole blood and
contrived whole blood samples and two lots of normal control ROTROL N. The trended
ROTROL N testing was performed to ensure that the base set of reagents in the extrinsic and
intrinsic assays were stable over time independently of the inhibitors that are present in the
other assays. The test cartridges were stored at 25˚C and tested at different time points.
Overall, the shelf-life test results support a 24-month shelf-life claim for ROTEM sigma
complete + hep cartridges at 25˚C.
In-Use Stability
An in-use stability study was performed to support the claim that the ROTEM sigma
cartridges are stable if they are used within 10 minutes of opening the sealed pouch. One lot
of ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridge was tested. Sample type included normal whole
blood, abnormal hypocoagulable blood, and abnormal hypercoagulable blood. Opened
sample cartridges were stored in a temperature and humidity-controlled chamber set to room
temperature (21.6–23.5˚C) and 55.3–59.6% relative humidity. Cartridges were used at three
time points. Overall, the study results support the cartridge in-use stability claim of 10
minutes at room temperature.
Transport Stability
To assess transport stability for the reagents used in the ROTEM sigma cartridges, a study
simulating the influence of elevated and freezing temperatures, which might occur during
transport, by subjecting the cartridges to different stressing conditions including no
precondition room temperature (15–25˚C), low temperature preconditioning (≤ -20˚C for at
least 24 hours) and high temperature preconditioning (40˚C for 5 days), was conducted. The
study evaluated one lot of ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridge using normal whole
blood samples, contrived whole blood samples and one lot of normal control (ROTROL N).
Each test run consists of three cartridges, each having undergone a different preconditioning
as described above. The results with temperature precondition were compared to the results
without precondition. Overall, the transport stress testing for the ROTEM sigma complete +

ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridge at temperatures ≤-20˚C for 24 hours and 40˚C for 5
days.
Sample Stability
A sample stability study was performed to assess the stability of fresh citrated whole blood
samples at room temperature used on the ROTEM sigma. Test samples included normal
whole blood samples, abnormal hypocoagulable samples, and abnormal hypercoagulable
samples. One lot of ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridge was used. Samples were run at
three time points. Overall, the results meet the predetermined acceptance criteria and support
the sample stability claim of 4 hours for whole blood samples ran on the ROTEM sigma
using the ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridges.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted at four clinical sites, with a minimum of two
trained POC operators at each site, to compare the performance of ROTEM sigma instrument
and assays to that of the predicate ROTEM delta instrument and assays using venous or
arterial whole blood patient samples from the intended use populations (cardiac surgery and
liver transplantation) and contrived samples. Citrated whole blood samples, collected from
181 patients 21 years and older, were used in this method comparison study.
The evaluated ROTEM parameters included CT, A5, A10, A20, MCF, LI60 and ML for
EXTEM C and INTEM C assays, A5, A10, A20 and MCF for FIBTEM C assay, and CT,
A5, A10, A20, and MCF for HEPTEM C assay. Parameter results were obtained from tests
run in singlicate. All evaluated parameters were analyzed using Passing-Bablok regression
and Bland-Altman plots. Slopes and intercepts, along with 95% confidence intervals, were
calculated from the respective regression fit. Correlation coefficients were also computed.
The bias (with 95% confidence intervals) between ROTEM sigma results and the ROTEM
delta predicate results was calculated from the regression fit at the extremes of the reference

interval and is presented along with Bland-Altman difference plots over the entire reference
interval. For the FIBTEM assay the parameter CT, LI60, and ML were not evaluated, since
they are not claimed parameters for this assay. Also, LI60 and ML were not evaluated for
HEPTEM C, as they are not claimed parameters for this assay.
The results for ROTEM sigma with ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridge versus the
ROTEM delta are presented below.

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison study using 74 matched venous and arterial citrated whole blood
samples was performed at two external clinical sites to evaluate the difference in test results
for venous and arterial blood on the EXTEM C, INTEM C, FIBTEM C, and HEPTEM C and
assays. The study was performed using four ROTEM sigma instruments at each site.
Seventy-four matched venous and arterial citrated whole blood samples were collected into
evacuated collection tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate and analyzed in singlicate on
ROTEM sigma systems using ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridges.
The pointwise biases of the paired differences were calculated. The pooled data summary
results for the ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridges are presented in the tables below.
Overall, the results demonstrated that venous and arterial whole blood samples are equivalent
on the ROTEM sigma system with the ROTEM sigma complete + hep cartridges.
