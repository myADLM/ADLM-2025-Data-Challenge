IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 is a one-step sandwich immunoassay. The assay uses
streptavidin-coated microparticles, a biotinylated monoclonal anti-cardiac Troponin T-specific
antibody, a monoclonal anti-cardiac Troponin T-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium
complex and electrochemiluminescence detection. Results are determined using a calibration
curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2-point calibration and a master
curve (6-point calibration) provided with the reagent bar code.
The Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 reagent kit includes:
• M Streptavidin-coated microparticles (transparent cap), 1 bottle, 6.5 mL: Streptavidin-
coated microparticles 0.72 mg/mL; preservative.
• R1 Anti-troponin T-Ab~biotin (gray cap), 1 bottle, 8 mL: Biotinylated monoclonal anti-
cardiac troponin T-antibody (mouse) 2.5 mg/L; phosphate buffer 100 mmol/L, pH 6.0;
preservative; inhibitors.
• R2 Anti-troponin T-Ab~Ru(bpy) (black cap), 1 bottle, 8 mL: Monoclonal chimeric
anti-cardiac troponin T-antibody (mouse/human) labeled with ruthenium complex 2.5
mg/L; phosphate buffer 100 mmol/L, pH 6.0; preservative.
For the neutralization of free biotin in Li-Heparin plasma patient samples, the sponsor developed
a monoclonal biotin scavenging antibody which binds to free biotin. The scavenger antibody is
specific for free biotin in the Li-Heparin plasma patient samples and blocks potential interference
from free biotin. The scavenger antibody does not bind to or interact with the biotin-linker
conjugates.

The labeling states “All human material should be considered potentially infectious. All products
derived from human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested individually
and shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods applied
were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II,
List A.”
B Principle of Operation:
The test uses both ruthenium-labeled and biotin-labeled antibodies to form a sandwich complex
with cardiac troponin T (cTnT). The formed immune complexes are immobilized onto the
surface of magnetic microparticles via biotin-streptavidin binding. The sample is mixed with
biotinylated monoclonal cTnT-specific antibody and a ruthenium labeled-monoclonal cTnT
antibody that reacts with TnT in the sample to form a sandwich complex. During this incubation
to form the sandwich complex, the complex is also captured to the solid phase. Microparticles
are magnetically captured onto the measurement electrode. Current is applied to the electrode to
stimulate chemiluminescent emission that is measured by a photomultiplier. Test results are
determined via a calibration curve. The measured electrochemiluminescence signal is
proportional to the amount of troponin T in the sample.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability and Intermediate Precision
Repeatability (within-run precision) and intermediate precision (within-laboratory precision)
studies were conducted according the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. Six lithium-heparin plasma
samples (samples ≤100 ng/L cTNT were native and samples >100 ng/L were spiked with
cTNT to achieve the targeted concentration) and two PreciControl Troponin controls were
assayed in two runs per day over 21 days using three reagent lots on a single cobas e 801
analyzer. For each lithium-heparin plasma sample and PreciControl Troponin control, 2
replicates were measured in each run. The analysis did not differentiate between runs
conducted on the same day, therefore, the precision estimates reported below are for 21 days,
1 run/day, and 4 replicates. Results from one representative lot of the three lots tested are
described in the table below. Within laboratory precision includes within-run and between-
day variability.

A reproducibility study was conducted according to the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. Five lithium-
heparin plasma samples (samples ≤100 ng/L cTNT were native and samples >100 ng/L were
contrived) and two PreciControl Troponin controls were assayed at three different sites (one
internal and two external sites) on three cobas e 801 analyzers over 5 days. Each sample was
measured in five replicates. A single reagent lot was used at each site. Repeatability, between

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted according to the CLSI EP06-A guideline. A 15-step dilution
series was prepared using a mixing scheme by mixing one native Li-heparin plasma sample
with cTnT concentration >10,000 ng/L (single donor) with low troponin T (~5 ng/L) native
patient samples (pooled single samples). The dilution series was measured on a single cobas
e 801 analyzer using five replicate measurements. The mean of these replicates was used to
calculate the reported results. Data were analyzed using weighted linear regression analyses.

Deviation from linearity within the claimed measuring range of the candidate test was up to
14.6%. The results confirm that the assay is linear across the measuring range of 6 to 10,000
ng/L.
3. Hook Effect
A study was performed to support the claim that there was no hook effect up to 100,000 ng/L
cTnT.
4. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous Interference
The effect of endogenous interfering substances on the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 assay was
determined on the cobas e 801 analyzer for the following seven interfering substances:
intralipid, biotin, bilirubin, hemoglobin, rheumatoid factors, cholesterol and human serum
albumin (HSA).
Three native Li-Heparin plasma samples spiked with low (20 ng/L), medium (100 ng/L), and
high (900 ng/L) concentrations of Troponin T were used to prepare dilution series. The series
were tested with one lot of the reagent for intralipid, hemoglobin, rheumatoid factors,
cholesterol and HSA and three reagent lots were used to evaluate interference from biotin.
For each dilution series, the sample pool spiked with troponin was divided into two parts.
One part of each sample pool was spiked with the interfering endogenous substance and the
other part of the same sample pool was spiked with the same volume of the solvent of the
interfering endogenous substance (without interfering substance). Three replicate
measurements were performed on each sample. For each interferent concentration level, the
recovery was calculated based on the mean value of the three replicates. Interference was
determined to be recovery > 100 ± 10%.
Highest concentration

Biotin 1,500 ng/mL
Intralipid (lipemia) 2,000 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 200 mg/dL
Rheumatic Factor 1,200 IU/mL
HSA 7 g/dL
Cholesterol 310 mg/dL
The labeling contains the following limitations:
It is recommended to run serum indices on samples for troponin T measurement.
Samples showing visible signs of hemolysis may cause interference. Falsely depressed
results are obtained when using samples with hemoglobin concentrations > 0.1 g/dL.
To evaluate potential interference from bilirubin, three native Li-Heparin plasma samples
spiked with low (20 ng/L), medium (100 ng/L), and high (1000 ng/L) concentrations of
Troponin T were used to prepare a dilution series. The series was tested with one lot of the
reagent. For each dilution series, the sample pool spiked with troponin was divided into two

parts. One part of each sample pool was spiked with the interfering endogenous substance
(conjugated or unconjugated bilirubin) and the other part of the same sample pool was spiked
with the same volume of the solvent of the interfering endogenous substance (without
interfering substance). Five replicates measurements were performed on each sample. For
each interferent concentration level, the recovery was calculated is based on the mean value
of the five replicates. Interference was determined to be recovery > 100 ± 10%.

The labeling contains the following limitation:
There are reports of autoantibodies to troponin T in the medical literature. Use caution
when interpreting a troponin T test result that does not appear to reflect the clinical
picture. The Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 assay may be interfered with by these
autoantibodies causing a falsely elevated or depressed result.
Exogenous Interference
The effect of exogenous interfering substances on the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 assay was
determined on the cobas e 801 analyzer for 22 cardiac drugs. Native Li-Heparin plasma
samples with low Troponin T (~20 ng/L) and Li-heparin plasma samples spiked with
Troponin T (9,000 ng/L) were used to prepare dilution series. For each dilution series, the
samples were divided into two parts. One part of each sample pool was spiked with the
interfering endogenous substance and the other part of the same sample pool was spiked with
the same volume of the solvent of the interfering endogenous substance (without interfering
substance). Three replicate measurements were performed on each sample (except for
ascorbic acid, which was measured in five replicate measurements). The series were tested
with one lot of the reagent in one run on two different cobas e 801 analyzers. For each
interferent concentration level, the recovery was calculated based on the mean value of the
replicates tested. Interference was determined to be recovery > 100 ± 10%. At the tested
concentrations, all drugs caused <10% interference.

Cross-Reactivity
To evaluate potential interference due to cross-reacting substances (listed in the following
table), the interferents were added to pooled lithium heparin plasma samples targeting cTnT
at low, medium, and high concentrations of cTnT (19-19.8 ng/L, 4,934-5,109 ng/L, and
6,762-7,501 ng/L). The low samples were native samples, and the medium range and high
range samples were samples spiked with recombinant troponin. Three replicate
measurements on a single cobas e 801 analyzer were recorded for each sample. For each
substance tested, interference was analyzed by comparing the true value sample (no
interferent added) to the test sample (interferent added) and calculated according to the
following formula: % recovery = test sample/true sample X 100. The potentially cross-
reacting compounds, at the following concentrations, did not interfere with the performance
of the device (i.e., did not result in bias >10%).

HAMA
The effect of human anti-mouse-antibodies (HAMA) on the Troponin T Gen 5 assay was
assessed on the cobas e 801 analyzer using Li-heparin plasma samples with Troponin T at
~20 ng/L and ~1,000 ng/L that were spiked with up to 805 μg/L HAMA. No interference
(bias < 10%) was observed at concentrations up to 644 μg/L HAMA.
5. Assay Reportable Range:
6-10,000 ng/L. See linearity section above.
6. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The assay is traceable to the Elecsys Troponin T STAT assay (4th generation).
Calibration
Data was provided to support the recommended calibration schedule.
7. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB)
The LoB of the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 assay on the cobas e 801 was determined
according to the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. The sample used was an analyte-free native Li-
Heparin sample. The distribution of values for the analyte-free Li-Heparin plasma sample
was determined with three reagent lots on one cobas e 801 analyzer and one reagent lot on
two cobas e 801 analyzers. Each sample was measured in six runs performed over at least
three days with 10 replicates in each run (N=60 per reagent lot). The LoB was calculated
using the nonparametric option described in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. The LoB was
determined as the 95th percentile of measurements of the blank sample for each lot. The
highest observed LoB across all lots and instruments was 1.87 ng/L.
Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD of the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 assay on the cobas e 801 was determined as the
lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with a 95% probability according
to CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. The distribution of values for five low-analyte Li-Heparin
plasma samples was determined using three reagent lots on one cobas e 801 instrument and
using a single reagent lot on two cobas e 801 instruments. Each sample was measured in six
runs over at least three days and with duplicate measurements per run (N=60 per reagent lot).
A pooled estimate of the precision (SD total) of the five samples was calculated. The LoD

was calculated using the formula, LoD = highest LoB + 1.653 x SD total. The highest LoD
observed across all lots and instruments was 2.99 ng/L.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The LoQ of the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 assay was determined on the cobas e 801 analyzer
according to the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline as the lowest concentration of analyte which can
be quantified with a CV (intermediate precision) of no more than 20%. The LoQ was
determined using ten native Li-Heparin plasma pools at cTnT concentrations spanning the
low-end of the measuring range of the candidate assay. Data were collected for each sample
using three reagent lots on one cobas e 801 instrument over 21 days with 2 runs per day and
duplicate measurements per run (N=84). Estimates of the mean and within-lab precision
were calculated for each sample for each reagent lot. Total CV is based on the total variance,
calculated as the sum of the variance components from day, run and within run (N = 21 x 2 x
2 = 84 measurements). The results are summarized below:

9. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The sponsor followed the recommendations in the “Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro
Diagnostic Devices. Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff” to demonstrate equivalence
between the unmodified assay (k162085) on the cobas e601 and the candidate assay on the
cobas e801. The sponsor conducted the studies recommended in the guidance including a
method comparison study using the predicate device reagent on the cobas e601 and the
candidate assay reagents on the cobas e 801.

One set of 299 lithium-heparin plasma samples collected from individual donors were tested
with one lot of the predicate device and three different lots of the candidate device. Of those
299 samples, 267 were within the measuring range of the device. Four of the samples were
pooled native lithium-heparin plasma samples spiked with recombinant human cardiac
troponin T. Passing-Bablok and weighted Deming regression analyses were performed
comparing the concentrations from the three different lots of the candidate assay on the cobas
e 801 to the predicate device. Results for a representative lot are shown below:

The sponsor also provided information to show no significant systematic differences between
the test systems.
10. Matrix Comparison:
To support the use of lithium heparin tubes containing separator gel for specimen collection,
174 paired native samples were tested using the candidate assay. Agreement rates were
calculated at each cutoff.

specimen collection.
B Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Data from the “The Advantageous Predictors of Acute Coronary Syndromes Evaluation”
(APACE) study, a multi-center prospective study were provided in support of the diagnostic
accuracy of the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5. Lithium heparin plasma specimens were collected
at 5 emergency departments (ED) from 1074 patients presenting to the ED with chest pain,

with onset or peak of symptoms within 12 hours of presentation to the ED. The only
exclusion criterion was kidney failure that required dialysis. Serial samples were collected
from patients beginning 0-1.5 hours from presentation to the ED and at the following time-
points relative to time of presentation to ED: 1.5-2.5 hours, 2.5-3.5 hours, and greater than
3.5 hours. After collection, samples were stored frozen until testing (the sponsor provided
data to support using frozen samples). Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was
performed by an independent adjudication committee, which included cardiologists, who
reviewed the clinical data and locally measured troponin test and applied the universal
definition of AMI. Investigators and adjudicators were blinded to the candidate device’s
results. Adjudicators were also blinded to site diagnoses. Frozen samples measured by the
candidate device were compared to the adjudication committee’s diagnosis of AMI. The
clinical performance (clinical sensitivity, clinical specificity, positive predictive value (PPV)
and negative predictive value (NPV)) of the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 STAT assay in the
diagnosis of MI in this trial is shown below. The results are summarized in the following
tables.
An analysis of device performance was performed separately for males and females using the
overall 99th percentile cutoff (19 ng/L). For those subjects who had more than one draw in a
single time window, the data below reflect the first measurement only, but information was
provided to show that the performance was equivalent using the other measurements.

In this study, there were 17 false negative subjects (out of 188 subjects adjudicated with
AMI). In these subjects, no result above the cutoff was obtained with the Elecsys
Troponin T Gen 5. Ten of these 17 subjects had presented within 3 hours of onset of
chest pain (early presenters) and for 8 of these subjects, no blood draw was tested with
the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 when the standard of care (SOC) troponin test detected
troponin concentrations above the SOC cutoff. For some subjects, this occurred more

than 7 hours after presentation to the emergency room. Two of these 8 early presenters
had an adjudicated diagnosis of ST‑segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
Two of the 7 subjects that were not early presenters had an adjudicated diagnosis of
STEMI and had no blood draw tested with the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 when the SOC
troponin test detected troponin concentrations above the SOC cutoff (up to more than 7
hours after presentation to the emergency room). Serial sampling is required to determine
a rise or fall in troponin over time.
The following limitations are included in the labeling:
Use caution in interpreting troponin values in patients who have presented within 3 hours
of onset of chest pain due to the potential for false negative results. In our studies,
troponin concentrations above the cutoff were sometimes only detected in these patients
more than 7 hours after presentation to the emergency department. Serial sampling is
required to determine a rise or fall in troponin over time. Troponin results should always
be used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms.
At certain timepoints, the PPV of this device is low. Troponin results should always be
used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms. Please see PPV reported in
Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for more information.
The sponsor also included the following information in the labeling:
Using the established sex‑specific 99th percentile (14 ng/L for females and 22 ng/L for
males), the lower end of the confidence interval (CI) for the PPV at all timepoints for
female subjects was as low as 18.8 %, and for male subjects it was as low as 45.4 %. Up
to 81.2 % and 54.6 % of positive troponin results in females and males, respectively,
were not myocardial infarctions. Troponin results should always be used in conjunction
with clinical signs and symptoms.
Using the established 99th percentile (19 ng/L), the lower end of the confidence interval
(CI) for the PPV at all timepoints for female subjects was as low as 25.8 %, and for male
subjects it was as low as 41.7 %. Up to 74.2 % and 58.3 % of positive troponin results in
females and males, respectively, were not myocardial infarctions. Troponin results should
always be used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms.
In addition, clinical performance estimates were provided from a second multicenter study
performed using the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 STAT (k162895) in the United States. Serial
samples were collected from patients upon presentation to the ED and at the following time-
points relative to time of presentation to ED: 3 hours, 6-9 hours, and 12-24 hours. A total of
1679 subjects presenting emergently with chest pain were enrolled. The trial excluded chest
pain subjects with an MI within the last 3 months, subjects with surgery or hospitalization
within the last 3 months, subjects with revascularization or percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI) within the last 3 months, subjects with an established acute non-cardiac
primary illness and subjects transferred from another hospital or facility. These excluded
subjects could be expected to have elevated troponin concentrations that would likely reflect
cardiac comorbidities besides MI, and yield positive results; therefore, the estimate of
specificity and the positive predictive values of this trial may be overestimated.

Within this population, 1675 subjects were evaluated on the cobas e 601 analyzer and there
were 173 adjudicated MIs. Final diagnoses were determined by an independent adjudication
committee which included cardiologists and emergency medicine physicians using the

The sponsor includes the following information in the package insert to describe the false
negatives observed in this study:
In this study, we observed 11 false negatives (out of 173 subjects adjudicated with AMI).
In these subjects, no result above the cutoff was obtained with the Elecsys Troponin T
Gen 5. Six of these 11 subjects had presented within 3 hours of onset of chest pain (early
presenters), and for 4 of these subjects no blood draw was tested with the Elecsys
Troponin T Gen 5 when the SOC troponin test detected troponin concentrations above
the SOC cutoff. For some subjects this occurred more than 6 hours after presentation to
the emergency room. Four of these 6 early presenters had an adjudicated diagnosis of
STEMI.
The following information is included in the labeling:
Using the established sex‑specific 99th percentile (14 ng/L for females and 22 ng/L for
males), the lower end of the confidence interval (CI) for the PPV at all timepoints for
female subjects was as low as 25.8 %, and for male subjects it was as low as 37.7 %. Up
to 74.2 % and 62.3 % of positive troponin results in females and males, respectively,
were not myocardial infarctions. Troponin results should always be used in conjunction
with clinical signs and symptoms.
Using the established 99th percentile (19 ng/L), the lower end of the confidence interval
(CI) for the PPV at all timepoints for female subjects was as low as 28.8 %, and for male
subjects it was as low as 34.1 %. Up to 71.2 % and 65.9 % of positive troponin results in

females and males, respectively, were not myocardial infarctions. Troponin results should
always be used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms.
The sponsor includes the following information in the package insert about troponin in other
disease states:
Troponins are released during the process of myocyte injury. While they are cardiac
specific, they are not specific for MI and detectable levels may be seen in other disease
states that involve the heart muscle (e.g. arrhythmia, acute aortic syndrome, acute heart
failure, hypertensive crisis, myocarditis, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism and
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy). In these disease states, serial sampling of troponin can
help distinguish between acute and chronic myocyte necrosis. The ACC/ESC/AHA
guidelines and the Universal Definition of MI recommend serial sampling with a rise or
fall in troponin to distinguish between acute and chronic cTn elevations..
2. Clinical Specificity:
See clinical sensitivity above.
C Clinical Cut-Off:
This assay has three claimed clinical cut-offs. These are an overall cutoff for all patients (19
ng/L), a cut-off for females (14 ng/L), and a cut-off for males (22 ng/L). These three clinical
cut-offs all were determined using the 99th percentile upper reference limit.
D Expected Values/Reference Range:
Data establishing the reference range for the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 STAT Assay was
previously reviewed in k162895. The 99th percentile upper reference limit was demonstrated to
be 19 ng/L overall, 14 ng/L for females, and 22 ng/L for males.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports a finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification supports substantial equivalence to the
predicate.
