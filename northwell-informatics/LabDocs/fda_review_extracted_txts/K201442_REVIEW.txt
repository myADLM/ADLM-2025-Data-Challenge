III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Lin-Zhi International, Inc. (LZI) Methamphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay for Pictus
Analyzers is intended for the qualitative determination of d-methamphetamine in human urine at
a cutoff value of 500 ng/mL. The system was calibrated with d-methamphetamine. The assay
provides a rapid screening procedure for determining the presence of d-methamphetamine in
urine.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative analytical
chemistry method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas or Liquid
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) are the preferred confirmatory
methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of
abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result is positive.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Diatron Pictus 700 clinical chemistry analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The LZI Methamphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay for Pictus Analyzers is a kit comprised of
two reagents, an R1 and R2, which are bottled separately but sold together within the kit.
Antibody/Substrate Reagent (R1): Contains mouse monoclonal anti-methamphetamine
antibodies, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers,
and sodium azide (0.09%) as a preservative.
Enzyme-drug Conjugate Reagent (R2): Contains methamphetamine-labeled glucose- 6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in buffer with sodium azide (0.09 %) as a preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
The Lin-Zhi International, Inc. (LZI) Methamphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay for Pictus
Analyzers is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with ready-to-use liquid reagent. The assay
is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of antibody in the reagent. Enzyme
activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, and the drug concentration in the sample is
measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the absence of drug in the sample, methamphetamine-
labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody, and the enzyme activity is inhibited. On the
other hand, when drug is present in the sample, antibody binds to the free drug; and the unbound
methamphetamine-labeled G6PDH then exhibits its maximal enzyme activity. Active enzyme
converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change
that can be measured spectrophotometrically at a 340 nm primary wavelength.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two studies were conducted to estimate the within-run and total imprecision of the test
system following the CLSI EP05-A2 guidelines. Nine samples at 0, 125, 250, 375, 500, 625,
750, 875 and 1000 ng/mL of methamphetamine (cutoff, ±25 %, ±50 %, ±75%, and ±100 %
of the cut-off) were evaluated in these studies. The within-run imprecision study was
performed by testing each of the nine samples in 20 consecutive testing. The total
imprecision study was performed by testing each of the nine samples in duplicate twice per
day over 21 days. The data were assessed for “positive” and “negative” interpretation at
either side of the 500 ng/mL cutoff. The results are shown in the two summary tables.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Four structurally related compounds were tested in duplicate at the concentrations described
in the table below. The reagents used in this assay are the same as those used in k113661, and
the information describing analytical specificity of the device reviewed k113661 was also
considered in this review.
Compound Target
Concentration (ng/mL)
d-Methamphetamine 500
d-Amphetamine 50,000
Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) 72,500
Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) 1,500
Results:
Compound Target P700 % Cross
Concentration Qualitative Reactivity
(ng/mL) Result
d-Methamhetamine 500 Positive 103.8
d-Amphetamine 50,000 Positive 1.1
Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) 72,500 Positive 0.8
Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) 1,500 Positive 34.5
The sponsor claims that the results from the testing of these four compounds are similar to
the results from the labeling of the predicate device. These results are adequate to
demonstrate that the interference and cross reactivity testing performed in support of
k113661 are representative of the expected cross reactivity and interference of these
compounds with the candidate test system.
