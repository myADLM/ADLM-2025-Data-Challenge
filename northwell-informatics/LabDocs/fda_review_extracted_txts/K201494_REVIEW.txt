The single or multi-test panels can consist of the above listed analytes in any combination, up to
a maximum of 16 analytes, with and without on-board adulteration/specimen validity tests (SVT)
in the dip card format or in the cup format. Only one cutoff concentration per analyte will be
included per device. The drug screen tests are intended for prescription use only.
The tests provide only a preliminary result. A more specific alternative chemical method should
be used in order to obtain a confirmed presumptive positive result if the donor doesn’t admit use
or anytime required by testing procedures. Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS),
Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) and their tandem mass-spectrometer
versions are the preferred confirmatory methods. Careful consideration and judgment should be
applied to any drugs of abuse screen test result, particularly when evaluating preliminary positive
results.

D Special Instrument Requirements:

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ATTEST Drug Screen Cup and ATTEST Drug Screen Dip Card devices are
immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for the qualitative detection of 6-
Acetylmorphine, d-Amphetamine, Benzoylecgonine, Buprenorphine, EDDP, d/l-Methadone, d-
Methamphetamine, d/l-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Morphine, Nortriptyline, Oxazepam,
Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, d-Propoxyphene, Secobarbital and THC-COOH. There are two
available test formats: integrated cup and dip card. Both formats utilize the same test strip. The
ATTEST Drug Screen Cup device consists of a cup device and a package insert. The ATTEST
Drug Screen Dip Card device consists of a Dip Card device, a package insert and a urine cup for
sample collection.
B Principle of Operation:
The Advin Biotech ATTEST Drug Screen Cup and Dip Card are rapid lateral flow
immunoassays, based on the principle of competitive binding, between a chemically labeled drug
(drug-protein conjugate) and the drug or drug metabolites which may be present in the urine
sample competing for the limited antibody binding sites. If target drugs are present in the urine
specimen below the cut-off concentration of the assay, the solution of the colored antibody-
colloidal gold conjugate that has been rehydrated by the urine sample migrates by capillary
action across the membrane to the immobilized drug-protein conjugate zone on the test (T)
region. The colored antibody-gold conjugate then binds with the drug-protein conjugate to form
visible lines in the test (T) regions. If the level of drug in the urine specimen is below the cutoff,
the T line appears and if they are above the cutoff, no T line develops. A separate antibody-
antigen reaction serves as an internal quality control as control line (C) line which must appear
on the strip to interpret the results regardless of the presence of the drug.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
Analytical performance for 15 analytes, besides Marijuana-THC-COOH detected with a 20
ng/mL cutoff (6-Acetylmorphine, d-Amphetamine, Benzoylecgonine, Buprenorphine, EDDP,
d/l-Methadone, d-Methamphetamine, d/lMethylenedioxymethamphetamine, Morphine,
Nortriptyline, Oxazepam, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, d-Propoxyphene, Secobarbital, and
Marjiuana-THC-COOH at 50 ng/mL) were conducted on k122809 and k182123. The analytical
performance of the device for the measurement of these analytes continues to be supported by
data provided in k122809 and k182123.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor conducted a precision study for 11-nor-∆9 -THC-COOH at three external sites.
Eight participants tested nine (9) solutions containing ±100%, ±75%, ±50%, ±25% and cutoff
levels of 11-nor-∆9 -THC-COOH in twenty (20) replicates for each device format at each
site.
Samples were prepared with drug free urine spiked with certified 11-nor-∆9 -THC-COOH
reference standards to the target concentrations. The samples contained following drug
concentrations: negative, -75% cutoff, -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff, cutoff, +25% cutoff, +50%
cutoff, +75% cutoff and +100% cutoff.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity: Analytical specificity for both the ATTEST Drug Screen Cup and the
ATTEST Drug Screen Dip Card for each assay was determined by testing drug free urine
samples spiked with certified standards of chemically-related or structurally-similar
compounds. The relative cross-reactivity (if any) represents the minimum concentration
necessary to yield a result similar to the cutoff level of the respective assay.
Performance data for Amphetamine (500 ng/mL cutoff), Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines,
Buprenorphine, EDDP, Cocaine (150 ng/mL cutoff), Ecstasy, Methamphetamine (500 ng/mL
cutoff), Marijuana, Methadone, Opiates (2000 ng/mL cutoff), Oxycodone, Phencyclidine,
Propoxyphene, and Tricyclic Antidepressants was provided in k122809.
Performance data for 6-Acetylmorphine devices (10 ng/mL cutoff, 6-AM 10), Amphetamine
(1000 ng/mL cutoff, AMP 1000), Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Methadone (300 ng/mL
cutoff), Cocaine (300 ng/mL cutoff, COC 300), EDDP (300 ng/mL cutoff),
Methamphetamine (1000 ng/mL cutoff, MET 1000), Opiates (300 ng/mL cutoff, OPI 300),
and Marijuana (50ng/mL cutoff, THC-50) was provided in k182123.

Interference: The potential interference (whether positive or negative) from compounds
chemically dissimilar to target drugs, known endogenous agents, urine pH and specific
gravity variances was also determined. Testing of compounds and endogenous agents was
performed by spiking the substances into pooled urine containing target drugs at near-cutoff
concentrations. Unless otherwise indicated, substances were tested for potential interference
at concentrations of 100 µg/mL.
The following substances demonstrated no positive or negative interference on the assays
encompassed in this submission when tested in samples bearing target drugs at +/-50% of
stated cutoff.

To evaluate the potential effect of variances in urine pH on the assays, pooled urine specimens
containing target drugs at near-cutoff concentrations were pH adjusted from 4.0 to 9.0 in
increments of 1.0 and tested in duplicate.
To evaluate the potential effect of variances of urine specific gravity on the assays, pooled urine
specimens containing target drugs at near-cutoff concentrations were diluted using deionized
water or concentrated using sodium chloride to achieve specific gravity results of 1.003, 1.010,
1.015, 1.020, 1.025 and 1.030. Each solution was tested in duplicate.
The results demonstrated that pH levels of 4 to 9 and specific gravity levels of 1.003 to 1.030 do
not affect the results of the THC-20 assay.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The Advin Biotech ATTEST Drug Screen Cup and Dip Card are traceable to a commercially
available standard.
This device has internal process controls. A control (C) lines (lines from a separate antibody-
antigen reaction forms appearing in the control region) confirms sufficient sample volume
and proper test technique. The lack of a visible control (C) line indicates an insufficient
specimen volume or improper test technique and the test must be repeated. There are no
external controls supplied with the device.
Device stability has been evaluated through accelerated and real-time studies. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims that
the devices are stable for 28 months.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
For characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration, please refer to section VII.A.1 and VII. B.1.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The sponsor performed a method comparison study of the ATTEST Drug Screen Cup and
Dip card using clinical urine specimens previously quantitated for THC-COOH by
chemically specific quantitative methods (e.g., LC/MS). Identical results, provided in the
table below, were obtained with the two devices. The results are shown in the table below.
Method comparison studies demonstrating device accuracy when measuring previously
cleared analytes can be found in K122809 and K182123.
