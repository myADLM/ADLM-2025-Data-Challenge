III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
N Latex FLC kappa and lambda are in-vitro diagnostic reagents for the quantitative
determination of free light chains (FLC), type kappa or type lambda in human serum and EDTA
plasma. N Latex FLC kappa and lambda assays are used:
• as an aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma (MM) on the BN Systems
and Atellica CH Analyzer
• as an aid in the diagnosis of immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis (AL) on the BN
Systems and Atellica CH Analyzer
• as an aid in the monitoring of immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis (AL) on the BN
Systems
• as an aid in the evaluation of Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance
(MGUS) on the BN Systems
Results of FLC measurements should always be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory
and clinical findings.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Warning: The result of the FLC kappa or FLC lambda in a given specimen determined with
assays and/or instrument platforms from different manufacturers can vary due to differences in
assay methods and reagent specificity. The results reported by the laboratory to the physician
must include the identity of the FLC kappa or FLC lambda assay used. Values obtained with
different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably. The values of FLC kappa or FLC
lambda on BN Systems and on Atellica® CH Analyzer should not be used interchangeably.
If, in the course of serially monitoring a patient, the assay method used for determining the FLC
kappa and FLC lambda levels is changed, additional sequential testing should be carried out.
Prior to changing assays, the laboratory MUST confirm baseline values for patients being
serially monitored.
Precaution:
• The performance of N Latex FLC kappa and lambda has not been thoroughly studied in
IgM and Light Chain MGUS patients due to the low prevalence of these subtypes.
• Patients with decreased renal function may have elevated FLC kappa and FLC lambda.
• Sample populations excluded MGUS populations that were further diagnosed with a
disease/disorder in subsequent testing with another medical device such as human
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Thus, because the
samples were enriched the specificity of the test may be inflated.

D Special Instrument Requirements:
BN II (K943997) and BN ProSpec Systems (K001647)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
No modification is made to the kit components for the N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC
lambda cleared in K171742; K182098; and K193047. The assays are comprised of the following
reagents in liquid form and ready-to-use:
• N latex FLC reagents: Consist of suspension of polystyrene particles coated with
monoclonal antibodies (mouse) to either human FLC Kappa or human FLC Lambda with
preservative.
• N FLC Supplementary Reagents A and B: N FLC Supplementary Reagent A contains
mouse immunoglobulin in buffered solution and N FLC Supplementary Reagent B: consist
of a buffered salt solution containing detergent.
• N FLC Standard SL: Contains human free light chains proteins, human serum albumin and
protease inhibitors.
• N FLC Controls SL1 and SL2: contains human free light chain proteins, human serum
albumin and protease inhibitors.
B Principle of Operation:
No modification is made to the principle of operation for the N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex
FLC lambda cleared in K171742; K182098 and K193047.
The N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda assays are based upon the principles of
particle-enhanced immunoassay. Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies to
human free light chains, type kappa or lambda, respectively, are agglutinated when mixed with
samples containing free light chains. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed through the
sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the respective
protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known
concentration.

C Clinical Studies:
Clinical performance of the N Latex FLC kappa assay and the N Latex FLC lambda assay as an
aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma (MM), and as an aid in the diagnosis of
immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis (AL) was previously demonstrated in K171742 and
K182098; and as an aid in the evaluation of Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined
Significance (MGUS) was previously demonstrated in K193047.
The performance of the N Latex FLC kappa assay and the N Latex FLC lambda assay as an aid
in monitoring of disease status in subjects diagnosed with AL was investigated in a clinical study
using archived and prospective samples tested by the candidate devices in multicenter sites. A
total of 111 AL subjects from four sites were enrolled in the study. Among them, 39 subjects
were excluded (26 subjects did not return for follow-up or passed away; four subjects with
wrong diagnosis; one subject not eligible; six subjects had no informed consent available; one
subject with incorrect sample handling; and one subject with insufficient clinical information).
The remaining 72 AL subjects with a total of 313 serum samples were used in the monitoring
study analysis for analysis.
Of the 72 subjects, 19 subjects were diagnosis with Kappa AL and 53 with Lambda AL. Forty-
six (46) subjects (64%) were male and 26 (36%) were female. The median age was 60 years old
with the age ranging from 32 to 84 years. The majority of the race of subjects were European
(n=58; 81%), 10 were U.S. Caucasian (14%) and the remaining four subjects were (5%)
unknown. A total of 313 blood draws were collected from these 72 subjects. The median number
of draws per subject was four, ranging from three to eight draws. The duration of the monitoring
days ranged from 55 to 4033 days (with a median of 417 days).
The information collected for each sample included the following: (a) general information
including patient’s demographic information and date of blood sample collection; (b) clinical
information including patient’s diagnosis report/medical notes, treatment initiated, and
diagnostic response criteria; c) laboratory data including serum/ urine electrophoresis results (M-
protein), serum/ urine immunofixation electrophoresis.
To evaluate the clinical performance of N Latex FLC, the response criteria derived from N Latex
FLC for each follow-up sample of each patient were compared to respective individual clinical
status. Five response criteria: CR (Complete Response), VGPR (Very Good Partial Response),
PR (Partial Response), SD/NR (Stable Disease/No response), PD (Progressive Disease) were
K201496 - Page 6 of 11

--- Page 7 ---
used to categorize each monitoring outcome for each patient based on the FLC Kappa and FLC
Lambda results according to the following three therapy response evaluation criteria:
• Evaluation Mode 1 based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network. "NCCN
clinical practice guidelines in oncology (NCCN guidelines)." Systemic Light Chain
Amyloidosis Version 1 (2022): 1–27.
• Evaluation Mode 2 based on criteria established by Peter Mollee et al., (Mollee, P., et
al. Evaluation of the N Latex light chain assay in the diagnosis and monitoring of AL
amyloidosis, Clin Chem Lab Med 2013 (Dec); 15 (12):2303–10).
Note: This publication emphasized that FLC methods can be used for monitoring if a
dFLC value of at least 50 mg/L is reached. Therefore, the same criterion may be
applied to detect recurrence (progression) of the disease.
• Evaluation Mode 3 based on criteria established by G. Palladini, et al.1, 2
1. Palladini, G., et al. (2019) When should treatment of AL amyloidosis start at
relapse? Early, to prevent organ progression, Blood Adv. 3:212–215.
2. Milani P., et al. (2018). Novel Therapies in Light Chain Amyloidosis. Kidney
International Reports 3(3):530–541.
Note: The publication evaluated the potential of low FLC levels and concluded that
patients with initial dFLC values below 50 mg/L can be monitored and established a
specific criterion for detecting a low-level response in the partial response categories.
All therapy response criteria based on above three Modes are summarized in the table below:

N Latex FLC versus Clinical Status
For each evaluation mode, the performance of N Latex FLC as an aid in monitoring of AL
patient was evaluated by comparing the clinical status assessed by physician (taking into account
all available clinical and laboratory information) with the response criteria derived from N Latex
FLC based on changes between the initial sample draw and each consecutive blood draw
independently. The results are summarized in the following tables. The 95% confidence intervals
(CI) were calcuated by bootstrap method to account for the correlations of multiple samples
within each subject.
