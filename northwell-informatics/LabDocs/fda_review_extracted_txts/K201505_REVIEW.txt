III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II
The DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay is intended for use on
the LIAISON® MDX instrument for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of
influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA in
nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract
infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. This test is intended for
use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral infections in
humans.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established with clinical specimens collected
during the 2010/2011 influenza season when 2009 H1N1 influenza and H3N2 were the
predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging,
performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should
be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses
and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted
in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Positive Control Pack
DiaSorin Molecular’s Simplexa ™Flu A/B & RSV Positive Control Pack is intended to be used
as a control with the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct kit and the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV
Direct Gen II kit for use on the LIAISON® MDX instrument. This control is not intended for use
with other assays or systems.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Special Instrument Requirements:
LIAISON MDX instrument with LIAISON MDX Studio Software
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The system consists of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay reagents (supplied in a
quantity for 24 reactions), the LIAISON MDX (with LIAISON MDX Studio Software), the
Direct Amplification Disc and associated accessories. The LIAISON MDX instrument is a real-
time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) thermocycler used for the identification of nucleic acids
from biological specimens. The Direct Amplification Disc (DAD) is compartmentalized into
eight separate wedges and up to eight separate specimens or controls may be processed on each
disc. Each wedge contains sample and reagent input wells, microfluidic channels and laser
activated valves to control the fluid flow, and a reaction chamber. The user adds 50 μL of
Reaction Mix to the reagent input well and 50 μL of unextracted specimen to the sample input
well. The reverse transcription, amplification and detection are performed automatically by the
instrument.
B Principle of Operation:
The Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay uses bi-functional fluorescent probe-primers
together with corresponding reverse primers to amplify Flu A, Flu B, RSV and internal control
RNA. The assay targets conserved regions of influenza A viruses (matrix gene), influenza B
viruses (matrix gene) and RSV (M gene) to identify these viruses in direct nasopharyngeal
swabs.
The LIAISON MDX uses fluorescence to quantify the amount of targeted nucleic acid sequences
in a sample. The LIAISON MDX has four optical detection channels, allowing for simultaneous
detection of up to four targets. Each module is optimized for a specific detection dye based on its
spectral characteristics. Each module contains a LED excitation source, filters, lenses and a fiber
port. Fluorescence is collected at the fiber port and transmitted to a single photomultiplier
detector. A sample is considered positive for a particular target if intensity of the optical reading
(fluorescence) crosses a particular threshold before a predetermined cutoff cycle.
An RNA internal control is used to detect RT-PCR failure and/or inhibition.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The modified device was evaluated in a reproducibility study testing a panel of eight
samples, representing a Low Positive (2x LoD) and a Moderate Positive (4x LoD) level for
each virus. The panel members were prepared by diluting viral stocks of influenza A,
influenza B and RSV strains (re-grown and titered) into pooled negative clinical matrix (NP
swabs collected in UTM). The panel included a Positive Control and a negative sample
consisting of UTM (no-template control).

The study was conducted at three distinct locations/work environments within the sponsor’s
facility to simulate three testing sites, where each site had two designated LIAISON MDX
instruments and two dedicated operators. Each of the two operators used a unique lot of the
reaction mix (for a total of two lots). Each panel member was tested in three replicates, in
two runs per day, over five days, at three locations. A total of 90 measurements (3 replicates
x 2 runs/day x 5 days x 3 sites) were generated for each panel member. The study design
allowed for evaluation of multiple components of variance.
The data was assessed for (a) qualitative results, i.e., percent agreement with expected
results, and (b) quantitative analysis of variance components, i.e., average Ct values and
calculated SD and %CV.

3. Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity
The Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay’s analytical specificity was evaluated in a
study testing samples containing organisms that are present as normal flora in the
nasopharyngeal passages as well as organisms that cause clinical symptoms similar to illness
with influenza A, influenza B, and/or RSV infection. Thirty-two different bacteria and
viruses were included in the study, with each organism tested in three replicates. No cross
reactivity was observed with the organisms at the concentrations tested, as shown below.

Microbial Interference
The performance of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay was evaluated for its
ability to accurately detect influenza A, influenza B, and RSV in the presence of other clinically
relevant pathogens. The same panel as above, consisting of 32 potentially inhibitory organisms,
was individually spiked into a pool containing low concentrations (approximately 2x LoD)
each of the influenza A, influenza B and RSV (A2) viruses. Samples were assayed in three
replicates. No inhibition was observed for influenza A, influenza B, or RSV by the organisms
at the concentrations shown below.

Competitive Interference
The performance of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay was evaluated for its
ability to accurately detect influenza A, influenza B, and RSV in cases of co-infection with the
assay’s target organisms. A low-level sample (Baseline Sample) was contrived at 4x LoD for
each target (influenza A, influenza B, RSV A, and RSV B), and a baseline Ct was determined
for each sample, as shown below.

Each potential concomitant infecting virus was spiked into the Baseline Samples at
approximately 10,000x LoD and assayed in triplicate. The following combinations were
tested.

Because the study revealed interference of Flu A, when at concentrations of 10,000x LoD,
additional testing was conducted with Flu A “interferent” samples contrived at 5,000x LoD
and 1,000x LoD to determine the approximate concentration where no interference was
observed with Flu B and RSV. The testing results from the study are summarized below.

The results indicate that the assay is subject to competitive inhibition in cases of co-infection,
where high levels of influenza A (i.e., >2.0 x 103 TCID /mL) will likely suppress the
50
detection of influenza B or RSV when those viruses are present at low levels. A limitation to
the labeling has been to disclose this vulnerability of the assay to competitive inhibition from
Flu A.
Interfering Substances
The performance of the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay was evaluated with
potentially interfering substances that may be present in nasopharyngeal passages. A total of
10 potentially interfering substances were individually spiked into a pooled nasopharyngeal
swab matrix containing influenza A (Influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68), influenza B (Influenza
B/Massachusetts/02/2012) and RSV (A2), each at a targeted concentration approximately 2x
LoD; each sample was tested in three replicates. No interference was observed with the
substances at the concentrations shown below.

the Reaction Mix. At each study time-point, the test samples were removed from the storage
conditions and equilibrated to room temperature prior to testing. The stability was evaluated
by the change in Ct values from baseline Ct (at day 0).
For Flu A in UTM samples:
a. After storage at 2-8°C for 7 days, the observed average change from the baseline Ct,
across all concentration levels, ranged from -0.1 to 0.1 Ct.
b. After 4 F/T cycles (7-day storage at 2-8°C followed by storage at -70°C), the
observed average change from the baseline Ct, across all concentration levels, ranged
from 0.1 to 0.6 Ct.
For Flu B in UTM samples:
a. after storage at 2-8°C for 7 days, the observed average change from the baseline Ct,
across all concentration levels, ranged from -0.1 to 0.5 Ct.
b. After 4 F/T cycles (7-day storage at 2-8°C followed by storage at -70°C), the
observed change from the baseline Ct, across all concentration levels, ranged from
0.0 to 0.3 Ct.
For RSV in UTM samples:
a. after storage at 2-8°C for 7 days, the observed average change from the baseline Ct,
across all concentration levels, ranged from -0.1 to 0.1 Ct.
b. After 4 F/T cycles (7-day storage at 2-8°C followed by storage at -70°C), the
observed average change from the baseline Ct, across all concentration levels, ranged
from -0.3 to 0.1 Ct.
The results demonstrated acceptable stability of samples collected in UTM when stored at the
above conditions for the time period under evaluation.
Specimens Collected in Other Collection Media
Additionally, specimen stability was evaluated when samples were collected in three other
collection media: Copan ESwab Liquid Amies, Remel M5, and Remel M6. The test samples
were prepared by diluting viral stocks of Flu A, Flu B, and RSV into each of the selected
media at concentrations ranging from approximately 2x LoD to 50x LoD. The samples were
aliquoted and stored at 2-8°C for three days, then frozen at ≤-70°C, to evaluate three
freeze/thaw cycles. The study utilized six LIAISON MDX instruments and one lot of the
Reaction Mix. At each study time-point, the test samples were removed from the storage
conditions and equilibrated to room temperature prior to testing.
Summary of results from the stability evaluation of samples collected in three other media, is
shown below.

The results demonstrated acceptable stability of samples collected in the three types of media
tested, when stored at the above conditions for the time period under evaluation.
The package insert includes the following storage and transport recommendations:
• Specimens collected in UTM should be transported on ice and may be stored at 2 to 8°C
for up to seven (7) days.
• Specimens collected in Remel M5, Remel M6, or Copan ESwab™ (Liquid Amies) should
be transported on ice and may be stored at 2 to 8°C for up to three (3) days.
6. Reaction Mix Open Vial Stability at Room Temperature
The stability of the Reaction Mix after opening was evaluated for room temperature stability
at 30 and 60 minutes timepoints. The study was conducted using Positive Control neat and
diluted 1:10 in UTM, testing two lots of reagents across two LIAISON MDX instruments.
Each neat sample was tested in duplicate at each time point with each lot of reagents. The
1:10 diluted sample was tested in 12 replicates at each timepoint with each lot of reagents.
All replicates were detected at all timepoints (0 (after preparation), 30 minutes and 60
minutes) and the observed change in Ct values was ≤ 1.2% for all three targets.
7. Quality Controls
External controls, the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Positive Control Pack, are available from
DiaSorin and may be used to monitor the assay performance and integrity of the reagents
over time.
Three lots of Positive Control were included in the evaluation of the Simplexa Flu A/B &
RSV Direct Gen II assay. The summary of the QC results is presented below.

8. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed using six LIAISON MDX Instruments,
two lots of Reaction Mix and two lots of Positive Control. A total of 67 runs were performed
by two operators over three days. The test samples were prepared by diluting viral stocks of
influenza A, influenza B, and RSV into pooled nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens
collected in UTM. Two strains of each virus were tested. The viral stocks were previously
titered in TCID /mL (Tissue Culture Infectious Dose at 50% per mL) and in copies/mL
50
using digital droplet PCR technique. Each of the virus strains was tested at four or more
concentrations near the expected LoD during the initial screening, followed by confirmation
testing at one or more concentrations with two lots of the Reaction Mix, in 20 replicates. The
LoD was defined as the concentration of the virus that resulted in at least 95% detection
during confirmation testing for each of the virus strains. The confirmed LoD values are
shown below.

9. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
The analytical reactivity of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II with various strains
of influenza A, influenza B and RSV, was evaluated by testing dilutions of quantified virus
stocks prepared by spiking into into pooled negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix (swabs
collected in UTM) at concentrations near the LoD. A total of 65 Flu A strains, 25 Flu B
strains and 11 RSV strains were tested in three replicates. Samples that were not detected in
all three replicates at the initially contrived concentrations were retested at a higher
concentration. The strains shown below were positive in all three replicates at the
concentrations shown.

Overall, the modified device demonstrated higher analytical reactivity with contemporary
strains of human influenza viruses than the original device.
.
10. Assay Cut-Off:
The fluorescent thresholds and assay Ct cutoffs were adjusted to optimize the sensitivity and
specificity of the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II based on the LoD data and results
from testing of 880 No-Template-Control samples, using three lots of the Reaction Mix
reagents, across 11 LIAISON MDX instruments. The overall positive and negative percent
agreements obtained from the method comparison testing with clinical samples were
determined to be satisfactory.
11. Carry-Over:
The potential for carry-over contamination using the LIAISON MDX instrument was
previously evaluated and reviewed under K120413. The study was performed by testing high
positive and negative samples in alternate positions on each disc. No carry-over
contamination effect was seen in the Flu A, Flu B or RSV channels.
An additional study was conducted with the modified device to evaluate the risk for cross-
contamination and to demonstrate the re-usability of the DAD consumable up to eight times.
In the first part of the study, two lots of DADs were evaluated, testing 10 DADs/lot and
utilizing 12 LIAISON MDX instruments. Each DAD was used to test two wedges at a time

In the second part of the study, four DADs were tested using Positive Control (PC) and
Universal Transport Media (UTM) as a No Template Control (NTC). Since each Disc can
accommodate up to eight samples, the purpose of the study was to demonstrate that each disc
can be used up to eight times, without a risk of contamination Each wedge of the DAD was
run one wedge at a time per run for a total of eight runs per DAD and 16 replicates of each
sample.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A clinical agreement study was performed using retrospective pre-selected positive and
negative leftover nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens collected in 3 mL Universal
Transport Media (UTM) from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract
infection. The specimens were collected at three collection sites at two geographical
locations. A total of 240 pre-selected positive and negative nasopharyngeal swabs, collected
between January 24, 2018 and December 15, 2019, were included in the evaluation. The
specimens were shipped on dry ice and stored at ≤ -70°C until testing. All specimens were
pre-selected for positive and negative status based on routine laboratory results at the
collection sites. The specimens were re-blinded and randomized prior to distributing them to
the internal clinical testing site at DiaSorin Molecular. Each specimen was tested using the
predicate device, Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct, and the modified device, Simplexa Flu
