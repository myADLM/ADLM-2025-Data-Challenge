5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Shelf life: The shelf life for the Merit Cultura Collection and Transport System was
determined to be 12 months from the date of manufacture. The shelf life of the Merit Cultura
Collection and Transport System was established using an accelerated stability study.
Accelerated stability was assessed by storing components at 55°C ± 2°C with a relative
humidity (RH) of 8.7 % ± 5% for 57 days to simulate storage at 22°C with an RH of 50% for
18 months.
Results were elaborated by calculation of expected real time stability using the Arrhenius
equation on a total of three lots. Shelf life stability was assessed using residual clinical
specimens at the Wyoming Public Health Laboratory using the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time
RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. Extraction was performed on the Qiagen QIAcube using the
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and testing was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500
Fast Dx PCR System with SDS v1.4 software, according to the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR
assay Instructions for Use. Lots subjected to accelerated stability testing were spiked with
one positive specimen in triplicate, one negative specimen, and a control containing nuclease
free water. Samples were held at 25°C (± 2°C) until hour 240 with aliquots taken at time 0,
120 and 240. All replicates at all timepoints gave a positive result (Ct < 40); the negative
controls also performed as expected.
Real-time stability testing was conducted concurrently and is continuing to verify shelf life
and determine if it can be extended beyond the current labeled shelf life of 12 months.
Sterilization: The Cultura Collection and Transport System VTM is provided to the end user
as a sterile media per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Standard Operating
Procedure: “Preparation of Viral Transport Medium.” 1 The manufacturing process includes
sterilization by gamma radiation set at a dose of 25 KiloGray (KGy) in accordance with ISO

K201674 - Page 5 of 9

--- Page 6 ---
11137-2:20152. Sterility was confirmed using sterility checks in lots subjected to accelerated
stability testing demonstrating no growth detected.
Transport: The stability of the Merit Cultura Collection and Transport System during
transport was established using a simulated transport study. Extreme simulated transport
testing was performed in accordance with ISO 2233:20003: 9 hours at -35°C at ambient RH
(Condition #2) followed by 9 hours at 20°C and 90% RH (Condition #6) followed by 9 hours
at 55°C at 30% RH (Condition # 12), with 2 hours of ramp time between conditions and 24
hours of equilibrium time at ambient lab conditions at the end. Simulated distribution testing
was performed in accordance with ASTM D4169-164, Distribution Cycle DC-13, Assurance
Level II to include simulations of product handling, vehicle stacking, loose load vibration,
and vehicle vibration.
Performance testing demonstrated that the candidate device provides adequate protection of
the contents during normal handling, transit, and storage.
6. Detection Limit:
Viral Recovery:
Culture-Based Viral Recovery Studies: Performance of the Merit Cultura Collection and
Transport System was evaluated for virus viability at different incubation times and
temperatures.
Stock Preparation. Strains of Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A (H1N1) virus,
influenza B virus (IBV), and rhinovirus 14 were used for media validation. The following
cell lines were obtained from ATCC and used for viral recovery: HEp-2 (for RSV), MDCK
(for H1N1 and IBV), and H1-HeLa (for rhinovirus). Ten-fold serial dilutions were performed
in cell culture medium (MEM with 10% FBS) and inoculated into the susceptible host cell
line. Host cells were plated at a suitable density in cell culture medium in microwell plates 24
hours prior to inoculation. Virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) of each dilution was
determined by microscopic observation.
Estimated Limit of Detection (LoD). The LoD was determined. Virus was inoculated in 1, 10,
and 100 particles in replicates of 3 into the susceptible host cell line. Host cells were plated at
a suitable density in cell culture medium in microwell plates 1-2 days prior to testing. Virus-
induced CPE of each dilution was determined in replicates of 4. The LoD is the minimum
concentration of virus that can be reliably detected (CPE in ≥ 50% wells). The LoD was
determined to be 1-9 virus particles for all viruses.
Viability Assay. Virus was inoculated to attain 2x LoD (~10 viral particles) in replicates of 4
into 3 lots of Merit VTM (600 μL in 2.4 mL). Tubes were stored refrigerated (2 to 8°C) or at
ambient temperature (23 to 25°C) up to 5 days. Aliquots of each replicate were recovered at
0, 48, 72 or 120 hours, serially diluted, and inoculated in replicates of 4 into the susceptible
host cell line. Host cells were plated at a suitable density in culture medium in microwell

plates 1-2 days prior to testing. The following controls were run: a viability control
containing no virus to ensure cell viability and no contamination; a virus control containing
virus stock to ensure infectivity of virus; a cytotoxicity control containing Merit VTM to
observe any CPE from the VTM; and, a recovery control containing virus in culture medium
stored and tested under the same conditions as the test samples. Viability was determined by
microscopic observation of virus induced CPE to determine the fifty-percent tissue culture
infective dose (TCID ). The Reed-Muench method was used: TCID = (% mortality above
50 50
50% - 50%)/(% mortality above 50% - % mortality below 50%) × log of the dilution factor.

Merit VTM demonstrated virus viability of RSV, IAV and rhinovirus for all replicates in all
lots, incubation times, and storage temperatures. For IBV, Merit VTM demonstrated virus
viability of all undiluted samples (2x LoD), but at a 10-1 dilution (below LoD) some
replicates demonstrated a loss of viability. The studies demonstrate that the Merit Cultura
Collection and Transport System maintains the viability of all viruses tested out to 120 hours
at refrigerated (2-8°C) and ambient (23-25°C) temperatures.
Amplification-Based Studies: Performance of the Merit Cultura Collection and Transport
System was evaluated by amplification of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid.
Extraction and Downstream Amplification. Molecular testing was performed with 12 unique
SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens at the Wyoming Public Health Laboratory using
the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, which detects SARS-CoV-2 (N1
and N2 nucleoprotein) markers. Extraction was performed on the Qiagen QIAcube using the
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and testing was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500
Fast Dx PCR System with SDS v1.4 software, according to the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR
assay Instructions for Use.
Serial dilutions of specimens from the SereCare AccuPlex SARS-CoV-2 Verification Panel
were spiked in the Merit Cultura Collection and Transport System at the LoD of the CDC
2019-nCoV RT-PCR assay to confirm that results are comparable to the LoD of the original
authorization. The results confirmed that the LoD is at 1,000 copies/mL (20/20 positive,
mean N1 Ct=35.13, mean N2 Ct=37.29).
For verification and evaluation of acceptable specimen transport time and temperature, 12
clinical specimens were spiked in triplicate at a dilution of 1:10 (300 μL in 3mL) into each of
