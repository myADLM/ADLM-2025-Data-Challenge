D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using VITEK 2 Systems 9.02 software
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Meropenem has the following concentrations in the card: 0.5, 2, 6
and 12 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL. The MIC result
range for the VITEK 2 AST-GN Meropenem test is ≤0.25 to ≥16 µg/mL. For all species, the
K201675 - Page 3 of 14

--- Page 4 ---
MIC result range indicates that the VITEK 2 system is capable of producing the following MIC
results: ≤0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and ≥16 µg/mL for the AST-GN Meropenem test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Meropenem was conducted at
three external clinical sites using a panel of ten gram-negative bacilli consistent with the
indications for use (i.e., one Enterobacter cloacae, and nine Pseudomonas aeruginosa
isolates). The majority of isolates evaluated in the reproducibility study were P. aeruginosa
as members of this species were more likely to provide on-scale MICs than isolates
belonging to the Enterobacterales. Each isolate was tested in triplicate over three days for a
total of 270 data points. Inocula were prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual
dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2 System. In addition, inocula were prepared by
the manual dilution method for use with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode of MIC values
was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was calculated based on the number
of MIC values that fell within ±1 doubling dilution of the mode.
All MIC values were on-scale and within one doubling dilution of the mode MIC and
therefore only best case results are reported. The testing resulted in overall reproducibility of
100% (270/270) for the auto dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2
System (auto-dilution and manual dilution) and 98.9% (267/270) for the VITEK 2 Compact
System (manual dilution only).
The results are acceptable.

Quality Control (QC) Testing
The CLSI recommended QC strains for meropenem, E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa
ATCC 27853, were tested a sufficient number of times (i.e., at least 20/site) at each testing site
using both the VITEK 2 card and broth microdilution (BMD) reference methods. Both the
automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual
dilution method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact.
K201675 - Page 6 of 14

--- Page 7 ---
Testing with E. coli ATCC 25922 provided off-scale results with the VITEK 2 card and the
BMD reference. The acceptable range for this strain is lower than the lowest dilution on the
BMD panel as well as the reported values for meropenem. In the device labeling the sponsor
indicated the expected QC range (0.008 – 0.06 µg/mL) and included the following footnote to
the device labeling QC table:
Does not include the full CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution range for QC testing with this
organism.
Results obtained using the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods for VITEK 2 and the
manual dilution for VITEK 2 Compact QC results are summarized in Table 1 below. Since The
expected range for P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 is contained withing the meropenem concentration
range included on the VITEK card, the quality control results were determined to be acceptable.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Testing of meropenem on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card was performed at three
external sites and one internal site. Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative
card with meropenem were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution
reference panel. The meropenem concentration range for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative
meropenem is ≤0.25 to ≥16 µg/mL for all species. The reference panel contained two-fold
serial dilutions with a concentration range of ≤0.03 to ≥64 µg/mL. The testing conditions for
the reference method consisted of the following:
Medium – Cation adjusted Mueller Hinton broth
Inoculation – Direct colony suspension
Incubation – 35° C in ambient air for 16-20 hours
The VITEK 2 cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test
inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using
the DensiCHEK Plus Instrument.
A total of 747 clinical isolates belonging to all genera were evaluated. of these 69.7% of
isolates were contemporary (tested within six months of isolation) and 30.3% of isolates were
stock isolates.
A total of 335 Enterobacterales clinical isolates were tested from indicated species (16 C.
freundii, 8 C. koseri, 53 E. cloacae, 109 E. coli, 2 H. alvei, 45 K. oxytoca, 53 K. pneumoniae
K201675 - Page 8 of 14

--- Page 9 ---
(including both K. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae pneumoniae), 7 M. morganii, 26 P.
mirabilis, 16 S. marcescens. A total of 179 P. aeruginosa and 176 isolates of Acinetobacter
spp. were also evaluated. The Acinetobacter spp. tested included the following species: 163
A. baumannii, 2 A. haemolyticus, 1 A. junii, 6 A. lwoffii, 4 Acintetobacter spp.
In addition to the testing performed using indicated species, isolates from the following non-
indicated species were also evaluated as clinical isolates: C. amalonaticus, C. braakii, C.
farmeri, E. tarda, K. aerogenes, E. asburiae, E. hermannii, K. pneumoniae ozaenae, M.
morganii, Pantoea agglomerans, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii, Raoutella planticola, S. enteritidis,
S. enteritidis enterica, Salmonella spp., S. rubideae, S. boydii, S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, and
S. sonnei. As isolates belonging to non-indicated species numbered approximately 10 percent
of the total number of Enterobacterales species, the performance with non-indicated species
was included in the overall performance calculations for Enterobacterales.
A total of 177 challenge isolates of Enterobacterales were evaluated using autodilution and
VITEK 2 including: 1 C. freundii, 18 E. cloacae, 26 E. coli, 1 H. alvei, 17 K. oxytoca, 81 K.
pneumoniae ( including K. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae pneumoniae), 7 M. morganii
(including 1 M. morganii sibonii and 6 M. morganii), 7 P. mirabilis, and 19 S. marcescens.
In addition,103 challenge isolates of P. aeruginosa and 43 challenge isolates of
Acinetobacter spp. were tested.
For Enterobacterales evaluated using VITEK 2 and auto-dilution, the overall EA and CA
were acceptable at 94.4% and 97.0%, respectively (Table 2). The overall major error rate was
acceptable, however an increased major error rate was observed with K. oxytoca (4.1%). In
addition, the EA for E. cloacae was reduced at 82.0%. Performance with P. vulgaris was not
acceptable and is not included in the intended use for meropenem. Performance issues with
E. cloacae, K. oxytoca and P. vulgaris are addressed in limitations (see below).
Review of the reference method and VITEK 2 MIC values for meropenem showed that the
majority of clinical isolates of Enterobacterales provided MICs less than or equal to the
lowest dilution on both the reference panel and VITEK 2 panel, resulting in unevaluable
MICs for the vast majority to tested isolates. The low overall value for EA of evaluable
results was most likely influenced by the low number of isolates with evaluable results (2.5%
of the overall number tested). This also affected the number of results available to assess
trending (see Trending and Table 4 below).
For P. aeruginosa evaluated using VITEK 2 and auto-dilution, EA was acceptable at 94.7%
(Table 2). The CA was 89.7% caused by 29 (10.3%) minor errors. Because the EA of
evaluable results was acceptable at 88.6%, and all errors observed were minor errors (no
major or very major errors), the CA of 89.7% was considered acceptable.
For Acinetobacter spp. evaluated using VITEK 2 and auto-dilution, EA and CA were
acceptable at 98.3% and 97.2%, respectively (Table 2). There were no major or very major
errors.

EA – essential agreement S – susceptible

CA – categorical agreement maj – major discrepancies
R – resistant vmj – very major discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) occurs when the result of the reference method and that of the VITEK 2 AST-Gram
Negative Meropenem are within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results
are those that are on-scale for both the reference method and the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Meropenem.
Category agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly
with the interpretation provided by VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Meropenem.
To assess the performance of manual dilution with the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact,
a total of 233 challenge isolates of Enterobacterales were evaluated including the following
species: 1 C. freundii, 18 E. cloacae, 26 E. coli, 1 H. alvei, 17 K. oxytoca, 115 K.
pneumoniae (including K. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae pneumoniae, 14 M. morganii
(including 12 M. morganii and 2 M. morganii sibonii, 7 P. mirabilis and 34 S. marcescens.
For manual dilution, E. cloacae and P. mirabilis showed decreased EA and CA when read
using both VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact at higher MICs. In addition, M. morganii
showed decreased EA when read using VITEK Compact at higher MICs. Performance issues
with E. cloacae, P. mirabilis and M. morganii are addressed in limitations (see below). Also,
as noted above the majority of clinical isolates of Enterobacterales showed MICs less than or
equal to the lowest dilution on both the reference panel and VITEK 2 panel, resulting in
unevaluable MICs for the vast majority to tested isolates. Consequently, a low overall value
for EA of evaluable results was most likely influenced by the low number of isolates with
evaluable results (3% of the overall number tested).
A total of 103 isolates of P. aeruginosa and 43 isolates of Acinetobacter spp. were evaluated
using manual dilution; results showed acceptable performance for both genera for manual
dilution with both VITEK 2 systems (Table 3).

To address the performance issues noted above for both autodilution and manual dilution, the
sponsor included the following limitations in the device labeling:
Perform an alternative method of testing prior to reporting for the following
meropenem/organism combinations:
• Proteus vulgaris
• When the VITEK 2 MIC is greater than or equal to 16 µg/mL for Enterobacter
cloacae
• Morganella morganii (when tested with VITEK 2 COMPACT if critical to patient
care
Perform an alternate method of testing prior to reporting results when a resistant result
is obtained:
• Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis
Resistant Strains
An insufficient number of resistant strains of C. koseri and H. alvei were evaluated. The
sponsor included the following limitation in the device labeling:
The ability of the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Meropenem to detect resistance to
meropenem is unknown for the following species because an insufficient number of
resistant strains were available at the time of comparative testing:
• Citrobacter koseri and Hafnia alvei
Resistance Mechanism Characterization
Isolates with the following resistance mechanisms were evaluated: KPC, KPC-2, KPC-3,
NDM, NDM-1, NDM-5, NDM-6, SME, VIM, OXA-48, OXA-181, OXA-232, CTX-M-1,
and ACT/MIR.

MIC Trending
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method for each organism group. This trending calculation
takes into account MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions
lower or higher than the reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values are
on-scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution
higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered int the
trending analysis.
Organism groups for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs.
lower readings was > 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined to be
statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that showed
higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in the labeling.
Evaluation of results for the Enterobacterales showed that a majority of isolates provided
MICs that were not evaluable for trending. Trending, therefore, was calculated using results
for all Enterobacterales combined (Table 4). Results for Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa
showed higher trending for all inoculation and read methods, while results for Acinetobacter
spp. showed lower trending for all inoculation and read methods. For the Enterobacterales,
only 6.5% of trending-evaluable isolates evaluated with autodilution, and no isolates
evaluated by manual dilution (VITEK 2 or Compact), gave the exact MIC as that obtained by
the reference method (which affected wording of the trending footnote).

The following footnote to the performance table was added to the device labeling to address
the observed trending:
Meropenem MIC values for Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa tended to be at least one
doubling dilution higher than the reference method and may contribute to the occurrence
of major errors for Enterobacterales. Meropenem MIC values for Acinetobacter spp.
tended to be at least one doubling dilution lower than the reference method.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GN Meropenem when revised breakpoints for
meropenem are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the
meropenem device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
