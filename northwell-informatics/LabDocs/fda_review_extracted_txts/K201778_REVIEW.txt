III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The i-STAT TBI Plasma test is a panel of in vitro diagnostic immunoassays for the quantitative
measurements of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase
L1 (UCH-L1) in plasma and a semiquantitative interpretation of test results derived from these
measurements, using the i-STAT Alinity Instrument. The interpretation of test results is used, in
conjunction with other clinical information, to aid in the evaluation of patients, 18 years of age or
older, presenting with suspected mild traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score 13-15)
within 12 hours of injury, to assist in determining the need for a CT (computed tomography)
scan of the head. A ‘Not Elevated’ test interpretation is associated with the absence of acute
traumatic intracranial lesions visualized on a head CT scan.
The test is to be used with plasma prepared from EDTA anticoagulated specimens in clinical
laboratory settings by a healthcare professional. The i-STAT TBI Plasma test is not intended to
be used in point of care settings.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT TBI Plasma cartridge is a multiplex immunoassay that contains assays for both
ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).
The assays test for the presence of these biomarkers in a plasma sample and yield a semi-
quantitative test interpretation based on measurements of both UCH-L1 and GFAP in
approximately 15 minutes. The i-STAT TBI Plasma cartridge is designed to be run only on the i-
STAT Alinity instrument, previously cleared under K153357.
The i-STAT TBI Plasma cartridge is a single use test cartridge. The cartridge contains a
biosensor chip, all reagents, a sample chamber, a waste chamber, an air bladder and the fluid
conduits, vents, and valve elements required to execute the test cycle. Reagents included in the
cartridge are buffer and preservative, as well as anti-GFAP/alkaline phosphatase and anti-UCH-
K201778 - Page 2 of 30

--- Page 3 ---
L1/alkaline phosphatase antibody conjugates for labeling/detection, and anti-GFAP and anti-
UCH-L1 monoclonal capture antibodies. All fluid movements (test sample or reagent) are
automatically controlled by the i-STAT Alinity instrument by electro-mechanical interaction
with the cartridge.
B Principle of Operation:
The i-STAT TBI Plasma cartridge consists of the UCH-L1 and GFAP assays and uses the
sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method with electrochemical detection
of the resulting enzyme signal. The immunoassay uses anti-UCH-L1/alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
and anti-GFAP/ALP antibody conjugates for labeling/detection (detection antibody-ALP
conjugates) and anti-UCH-L1 and anti-GFAP monoclonal antibodies for capture (capture
antibodies) that together allow for the detection and measurement of antigen in a plasma sample.
The detection and capture antibodies recognize distinct regions or epitopes on their respective
antigens. All the steps of the ELISA are automated and conducted inside the test cartridge.
The multiplex design is based on the high degree of specificity inherent in antibody/antigen
interactions. Additionally, the architecture of the cartridge and sensor design affords separation
of these two antibody/antigen combinations such that the electrochemical signals arising from
each analyte are measured independently at different areas of the biosensor chip contained within
the cartridge.
The biosensor chip inside the cartridge features two electrochemical capture sensors that consist
of microfabricated amperometric electrodes on a silicon substrate. After sample addition to the
cartridge, the detection antibody-ALP conjugates dissolve into the sample. The capture
antibodies immobilized on separate sensors on the chip capture the antigens (GFAP and UCH-
L1) present in the sample that have bound to the detection antibody-ALP conjugate to form a
sandwich (detection antibody-ALP conjugate/antigen/capture antibody) during an incubation
period of approximately 12 minutes. After a wash step to remove excess labeling antibody
conjugate and non-specifically bound proteins, the antigen is measured as electrochemical signal
generated through enzymatic conversion of the ALP substrate present in the wash fluid. The
current is proportional to the amount of labeled antigen (UCH-L1/GFAP) immobilized on the
sensor. This electrical signal is converted into a quantitative measurement of the plasma
concentration of UCH-L1 and GFAP reported in units of pg/mL.
The i-STAT TBI Plasma cartridge is designed to be run only on the i-STAT Alinity instrument.
The i-STAT Alinity instrument (previously cleared under K153357) is a handheld, in vitro
diagnostic device designed to run only i-STAT test cartridges. The instrument is the main user
interface of the i-STAT System and functions as the electro-mechanical interface to the test
cartridge. The instrument executes the test cycle, acquires and processes the electrical sensor
signals converting the signals into quantitative results. These functions are controlled by a
microprocessor.
The user interface includes a touch screen display, audible signals, and ability to input
information using a barcode reader and the touch screen. Based on the quantitative measurement
of the plasma concentration of GFAP and UCH-L1 (pg/mL), an interpretation (semi-quantitative
result) is first displayed on the screen (“Elevated,” “Not Elevated,” or “Repeat Test”). A second
page displays the quantitative results of each test. The table below provides the test interpretation

matrix based on the GFAP and UCH-L1 assay results relative to cut-offs. The assay cut-offs
were established to be 30 pg/mL for GFAP and 360 pg/mL for UCH-L1.

(***) Star-out condition. “***” is displayed rather than a quantitative result. Instrument unable to determine a
quantitative result due to signals received from a particular sensor on the cartridge being detected as
uncharacteristic. Because the other assay provides a result at or above cut-off, a test interpretation can be reported.
‡Results are not available for either assay, or a result is available for one assay with the other assay providing a
result below cut-off. In these circumstances, an error code “QCF125” will be displayed with instruction to repeat the
test.
A “Not Elevated” test interpretation is associated with the absence of acute traumatic intracranial
lesions visualized on a head CT scan. An “Elevated” test interpretation suggests further
evaluation by head CT scan should be considered. A “Repeat Test” test interpretation indicates
suppressed (not reported) results for both assays, or suppressed results (not reported) from one
assay and the other assay providing a result below cut-off. In these circumstances, an error code
(Quality Check Failure, or QCF) will be displayed with instruction for the end-user to repeat the
test (no more than once).

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
All results met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The study designs and analyses for precision studies were based on the CLSI guideline EP05-
A3. Samples in the test panel evaluated in each precision study were generated to cover the
measuring range of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays. Pooled plasma samples were generated
from whole blood collected in K EDTA tubes from normal healthy donors. Plasma samples
2
near GFAP and UCH-L1 cut-offs were spiked with native antigen from plasma of subjects
with traumatic brain injury (TBI) to more closely mimic clinical specimens. Other samples
evaluated in the study were spiked with recombinant GFAP and UCH-L1.
a. Within-laboratory precision:
Semi-quantitative precision: The purpose of this study was to evaluate within-laboratory
precision of GFAP and UCH-L1 assays within the i-STAT TBI cartridge on the i-STAT
Alinity instrument using plasma samples. Plasma samples consisted of nine plasma
samples for GFAP and seven plasma samples for UCH-L1. Each panel member was
tested at a single site for at least 20 days, by multiple operators, with two runs per day,
two replicates per run, on two or three lots of i-STAT TBI cartridges, using multiple i-
STAT Alinity instruments, to generate a total of 160 or 240 replicates per panel member,
respectively. Runs were separated by a minimum of 2 hours. Two levels of i-STAT TBI
control material, L1 (i-STAT TBI Control Level 1) and L2 (i-STAT TBI Control Level
2), were also run in the study. The results are summarized in the tables below for the
GFAP and UCH-L1 assays.

Qualitative precision: A total of 160 – 240 replicates of each panel member were tested
across two or three lots of i-STAT TBI cartridges to evaluate qualitative precision. The
panel members were identical to those in the 20-day within-laboratory semi-quantitative

Qualitative precision: A total of 75 replicates of each plasma sample were tested across
three instruments to evaluate qualitative precision. The plasma samples were identical to
those in the instrument-to-instrument semi-quantitative precision study above. The %
correct call was calculated for each plasma sample and was based on the number of
replicates providing the expected GFAP/UCH-L1 result (Not Elevated or Elevated) based
on the mean antigen concentration for the sample (either below cut-off or at/above cut-
off, respectively). Results are summarized in the table below for each assay.

c. Multi-site precision study
Semi-quantitative precision: The purpose of this study was to evaluate precision of GFAP
and UCH-L1 assays within the i-STAT TBI cartridge on the i-STAT Alinity instrument
using plasma samples at three clinical sites. The medical facilities in the study were
representative of the setting in which the i-STAT TBI Plasma test is intended to be used
and the two operators at each site, who performed the testing, were representative of end-
users of the i-STAT System. At each site, a panel of six GFAP samples and a panel of
five UCH-L1 samples, were tested once per day for five days by two operators at each of
the three sites, and three replicates per operator run, to generate a total of 90 replicates
per panel member. Each operator ran each panel member on three i-STAT Alinity
instruments. All panel members at all sites were evaluated using a single cartridge lot and
each site evaluated the same panel members (which were provided to each site). The
results are summarized in the tables below for the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays.

2. Linearity:
a. Linearity
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the linearity of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays
within the i-STAT TBI cartridge on the i-STAT Alinity instrument over the reportable range
of each assay per the CLSI guideline EP06-A. Two studies for each assay were conducted in
parallel and the data from the studies were combined to evaluate the linearity for each assay.
One study used the native antigen and the other study used the recombinant antigen at
concentrations that overlap with those of the native antigen. In each study, plasma samples of
varying GFAP and UCH-L1 levels were prepared through proportional mixing of low and
high antigen concentration samples. The highest concentration sample with the native antigen
was created by spiking an aliquot of K EDTA whole blood with plasma (<5% v/v) from a
2
severe TBI patient exhibiting high levels of both GFAP and UCH-L1 antigens. The highest
concentration sample with the recombinant antigen was created by spiking whole blood with
recombinant GFAP and UCH-L1 to target ranges. Samples with intermediate levels of native
and recombinant GFAP and UCH-L1 antigens were obtained through a process of
proportional mixing of low and high antigen concentration samples. For evaluation of GFAP
assay linearity, 10 sample levels of the native antigen samples and 17 sample levels of the
recombinant antigen samples were generated. For evaluation of UCH-L1 assay linearity,
seven sample levels of the native antigen samples and seven sample levels of the
recombinant antigen samples were generated. Plasma samples used for testing were prepared
by separating the plasma portion of the whole blood samples from the red blood cells via
centrifugation. The expected values for GFAP and UCH-L1 of each plasma sample were
calculated based on add-mix ratios of the high and low plasma levels with known
concentration, measured by the i-STAT TBI cartridges on i-STAT Alinity instruments. Six

To evaluate linearity, weighted least squares regression analyses were performed using
replicates from all sample levels (native and recombinant) for both GFAP and UCH-L1
antigens, and an assessment of the deviation from linearity was determined for each
sample level for GFAP and UCH-L1. Linearity was demonstrated throughout the
measurable ranges for both GFAP and UCH-L1 assays (23–10,000 pg/mL for GFAP and
70–3200 pg/mL for UCH-LI) with a deviation from linearity within 15%.
b. Hook effect
To show that a clinical specimen with very high concentrations of antigen would not cause
false negative results (“Not Elevated” result) hook effect studies were performed. The testing
was conducted using one lot of i-STAT TBI cartridges, a plasma sample that was prepared
from K EDTA venous whole blood collected from one donor and spiked to a high antigen
2
level for each assay (GFAP and UCH-L1), and multiple i-STAT Alinity instruments. No
hook effect was observed for the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays within the i-STAT TBI cartridge
using plasma samples with antigen concentrations exceeding 100,000 pg/mL GFAP and
100,000 pg/mL UCH-L1, respectively, when tested on the i-STAT Alinity instrument.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Studies to evaluate the analytical specificity/interference were conducted using two or three
lots of i-STAT TBI cartridges and multiple i-STAT Alinity instruments. Two levels of GFAP
and UCH-L1 samples were evaluated in the studies: low (39–54 pg/mL) and high (120–180
pg/mL) GFAP, and low (468–648 pg/mL) and high (1440–2160 pg/mL) UCH-L1. Plasma
prepared from K EDTA venous whole blood sourced from normal healthy donors was used
2
to create low-positive (low) and moderate-positive (high) GFAP and UCH-L1 base pools for
the preparation of the control samples and the potentially interfering test samples.
Recombinant GFAP and UCH-L1 was added to achieve the targeted GFAP and UCH-L1
concentrations.
a. Endogenous and exogenous interference
Each potentially interfering substance was tested at the toxic/pathological concentration
based on CLSI guideline EP37 Ed1, as applicable, and indicated in the tables below. The
effect of each substance at each level of GFAP and UCH-L1 was evaluated by comparing the
test results from a control sample, spiked with the appropriate solvent used to prepare the
stock solution of the potentially interfering substance, with the test results from a sample
spiked with a solution containing the potentially interfering substance as per CLSI guideline
EP07 Ed3, and listed below. Each test and control sample was evaluated with at least 15
replicates for each potentially interfering substance. A substance was identified as an
interferent if the difference in the means between the control and test samples was not within:
± the greater of 6 pg/mL or 10% of the control sample mean for GFAP, ± the greater of 40
pg/mL or 10% of the control sample mean for UCH-L1. For any substances identified as an
interferent at the initial concentration tested, a dose response analysis was performed.
Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) were also evaluated as
potentially interfering endogenous substances. The low- and high-level GFAP and UCH-L1
samples were initially evaluated with screening concentrations of >160X HAMA and 1000

IU/mL RF, which are the concentrations of these substances evaluated in DEN170045.
Multiple test and control samples were generated for both the low- and high-level GFAP and
UCH-L1 samples, and 30 replicates of each sample were evaluated.

With the exception of HAMA and RF, none of the endogenous and exogenous substances
evaluated at the concentrations indicated in the table above demonstrated interference with
the GFAP or UCH-L1 assays at low or high concentrations of GFAP and UCH-L1. Only one
exogenous substance – ethanol – was found to interfere with the UCH-L1 assay. Neither
HAMA nor RF was found to interfere with the GFAP assay at the concentrations tested.
However, both HAMA and RF were found to interfere with the UCH-L1 assay. A dose-
response study was performed to determine the highest test concentrations of HAMA, RF,
and ethanol at which no interference could be demonstrated with the UCH-L1 assay using
samples with high and low levels of UCH-L1. The table below summarizes the results of the
HAMA, RF, and ethanol interference study on the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays.

selected were representative of a low positive concentration for each assay, to provide insight
into the potential for the cross-reactant substance to affect medical decisions. Each potential
cross-reacting substance was tested at a concentration that corresponds to its highest reported
physiological level reported in circulation according to literature, as applicable, indicated in
the table below, and as per DEN170045. The effect of each potential cross-reactant was
evaluated by comparing the test results from a control sample, spiked with the appropriate
solvent used to create the stock solution of the potential cross-reactant, with the test results
from a sample spiked with the potentially cross-reacting substance as per CLSI guideline
EP07 Ed3. Each test and control sample was evaluated with a similar number of replicates,
with at least 10 replicates evaluated for each potentially cross-reacting substance.
Results as summarized in the table below demonstrate that none of the potentially cross-
reacting substances tested were found to interfere with the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays.

c. Cross-talk
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays within the i-STAT
TBI cartridge on the i-STAT Alinity instrument for potential cross-talk. Cross-talk is the
potential for high levels of the antigen (GFAP or UCH-L1) of one assay to impact the result
of the other assay. The study was conducted using one lot of i-STAT TBI cartridges, plasma
samples prepared from K EDTA venous whole blood collected from healthy donors and
2
spiked to low and high GFAP and UCH-L1 levels and multiple i-STAT Alinity instruments.
Two levels (low and high) for both GFAP (85–117 pg/mL and 585–715 pg/mL) and UCH-L1
(468–648 pg/mL and 3240–3960 pg/mL) were tested in the absence (control sample) and
presence (test sample) of a single high level concentration of the other antigen (at 100,000
pg/mL) for potential crosstalk. The potential for cross-talk was evaluated by comparing the
result from the control sample with the result from the corresponding test sample containing

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range for GFAP is 30–10,000 pg/mL and the reportable range for UCH-L1 is
200–3,200 pg/mL. Assay results may be preceded by the symbol for greater than (>) or less
than (<) if the result is outside of the reportable range.
GFAP concentrations below 30 pg/mL and UCH-L1 concentrations below 200 pg/mL can be
reliably measured by each assay. See Section A.2.a Linearity and Section A.6 Detection
Limit.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
i. Traceability: There are no internationally recognized standard reference materials
available for GFAP or UCH-L1. The traceability of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays within
the i-STAT TBI Plasma cartridge has been established against reference material created
using recombinant GFAP and UCH-L1 antigens that are expressed in and purified from
Escherichia coli. The reference materials are divided into aliquots and stored frozen at
-80°C.
ii. Quality Control: The i-STAT TBI Controls may be used to monitor performance of the
GFAP and UCHL1 assays within the i-STAT TBI Plasma cartridge on the i-STAT
Alinity instrument. The controls are packaged and sold separately from the cartridges.
The i-STAT TBI Controls have two levels: i-STAT TBI Control Level 1 and i-STAT TBI
Control Level 2 and each level is packaged separately.
iii. Calibration Verification Material: Calibration verification material may be used to verify
the pre-set calibration of the i-STAT TBI Plasma cartridge throughout the reportable
range. Calibration verification materials are available to meet clinical laboratory and
regulatory requirements and are sold separately from the cartridges.

iv. i-STAT Cartridge Stability: A real-time shelf-life stability study performed on eight lots
of i-STAT TBI Plasma cartridges support shelf-life claims of six months when stored at
refrigerated temperatures (2–8°C) and 14-days when stored at room temperature (18–
30°C).
v. Sample Stability and Storage: In order to evaluate fresh plasma stability, plasma samples
targeting three levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 that covered the reportable ranges of the
antigens were evaluated. Plasma obtained from approximately 10 apparently healthy
donors were each spiked with antigen (from either pooled TBI patient samples or spinal
cord lysate) to the three targeted concentration levels of GFAP and UCH-L1, thereby
generating a total of 30 samples total and 10 unique samples for each GFAP and UCH-L1
level. The results from the study support the following stability claims: immediate use of
plasma preparation or room temperature storage for up to 2 hours. Specifically, if plasma
testing is not planned for immediately after plasma preparation, remove the top 1/3 of the
separated plasma. Place the plasma in an aliquot tube, cover and store at room
temperature for up to 2 hours.
vi. Temperature Operating Range: In order to evaluate the performance of the GFAP and
UCH-L1 assays within the i-STAT TBI Plasma cartridge when operated at an elevated
temperature, a study was performed in which GFAP and UCH-L1 samples near their
respective cut-offs (30 pg/mL and 360 pg/mL, respectively) were tested on i-STAT
Alinity instruments at room temperature (24.4°C/75.9°F) compared to samples tested on
i-STAT Alinity instruments at elevated temperature (tests run in a temperature chamber
at 30.8°C/87.4°F). A total of approximately 120 cartridges were run at each temperature
condition. This study demonstrated that the average relative percent difference in
performance is -8.6% for the GFAP assay with testing at elevated temperature and an
average relative percent difference in performance of -5.1% for the UCH-L1 assay with
testing at the elevated temperature. The results from this study are provided in the table
below.

6. Detection Limit:
The purpose of this study was to determine the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the GFAP and
UCH-L1 assays within the i-STAT TBI Plasma cartridge using the i-STAT Alinity
instrument. The study design was based on the CLSI guideline EP17-A2 and the LoQ of each
assay was determined using the precision profile approach as described in this guideline. The
testing was conducted on five days using four lots of i-STAT TBI cartridges and pooled
plasma samples prepared from K EDTA venous whole blood collected from 11 donors and

spiked with antigen from a patient plasma pool to achieve six target low antigen levels of
GFAP and UCH-L1. Ten replicates of each sample were run on each of the four lots of
cartridges every day for five days, generating a total of 50 replicates per sample for each
cartridge lot, and ~200 replicates per sample across all four lots of cartridges. The within-
laboratory precision (as %CV) was calculated for each assay and sample tested. The criteria
for determination of the LoQ for each assay was based on the requirement for within-
laboratory precision < 15%CV as evaluated in the LoQ study and a deviation from linearity <
15% as determined by the linearity study (see Section A.2.a). The LoQ for each assay should
also be least 20% below the assay cut-off. Based on these criteria, the LoQ for GFAP was
determined to be 23 pg/mL and the LoQ for UCH-L1 was determined to be 70 pg/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The GFAP and UCH-L1 assay cut-offs were determined by analyzing a training dataset from
samples collected from a completely independent population distinct from subjects evaluated
in the pivotal study to validate the assay cut-offs. Samples to establish the cut-offs were
collected as part of the TRACK-TBI (Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in
Traumatic Brain Injury) study. A total of 420 subjects (65.2% male, 34.8% female) with
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores between 13–15 who had blood specimens collected
within 12 hours from the time of suspected head injury were included in the training dataset.
Of the 420 subjects, 18% had a positive computed tomography (CT) result. Using a 10-fold
cross validation and bootstrapping method, the optimal cut-off values were selected as 360
pg/mL for UCH-L1 and 30 pg/mL for GFAP.

The ability of the i-STAT TBI Plasma test to assist physicians in determining the need for a
computed tomography (CT) scan of the head in conjunction with other clinical information
was evaluated by testing frozen plasma specimens that were previously collected by Banyan
Biomarkers (San Diego, CA) from subjects participating in their study “A Prospective
Clinical Evaluation of Biomarkers of Traumatic Brain Injury” (ALERT-TBI, protocol ATO-
06). A total of 1901 frozen and de-identified plasma samples these subjects were tested at
three (3) clinical sites by operators representative of end-users of the i-STAT System. Each

specimen was associated with a standard of care computed tomography (CT) scan of the head
from the same study subject. Under the ALERT-TBI study protocol, the CT scans were
independently reviewed by a panel of radiologists and a subject’s CT scan was classified as
positive if intracranial lesions were present. The standard of care head CT scans were
previously classified as positive or negative for intracranial lesions as part of the ALERT-
TBI study. Additional details regarding the evaluation of CT scans and definition of
intracranial lesion can be found in DEN170045. The demographic characteristics of the
enrolled subjects evaluated with the i-STAT TBI Plasma test are presented in the table

The following head injury characteristics were collected for all evaluable subjects and
summarized in the table below. The mean time from head injury to blood draw was 3.5
hours. Most subjects had a GCS score of 15 (94/120 or 78.3% in CT scan-positive subjects
and 1695/1781 or 95.2% in CT scan-negative subjects). The percentage of subjects with GCS
scores of 13 and 14 were higher in the CT scan-positive subjects compared to the CT scan-

C Prior to head CT
The most common head CT findings in the 120 subjects with CT-positive scans were scalp
injury (96.7%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (59.2%), the presence of incidental findings
(57.5%), and acute subdural hematoma (47.5%). Other frequently reported findings included
cranial fractures (26.7%), parenchymal hematoma (20.0%), facial fractures (16.7%), skull
based fractures (15.0%), and indeterminate extra-axial lesions (15.0%). All other findings
occurred in less than 10% of CT-positive subjects.
To estimate clinical performance characteristics, the i-STAT TBI Plasma test results were
compared to the consensus head CT scan result for each patient. The performance estimates
are summarized in the 2x2 table below. Of the 1901 evaluable subjects, 120 had positive CT
scan results. Of the 120 subjects with positive CT scan results, 115 had an Elevated i-STAT
TBI test result (sensitivity = 95.8%). The remaining five CT scan positive subjects had Not
Elevated results from the i-STAT TBI Plasma test. The rate of false negative (FN) results
was 4.2% (5/120). None of the five subjects identified with a lesion requiring surgical
intervention had a FN result suggesting that i-STAT TBI Plasma test correctly classified all
these five CT-positive subjects with an Elevated test result. Of the 1781 subjects with
negative CT scan results, 720 had a Not Elevated i-STAT TBI Plasma test result (specificity
= 40.4%). The rate of False Positive (FP) results was 59.6% (1061/1781). Overall, there were
725 subjects with Not Elevated i-STAT TBI Plasma test results. Of these, 720 had negative
CT scan results. The Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the assay was 99.3% (720/725).
The potential benefit of the assay would be a reduction in unnecessary CT scans by
approximately 40% (40.4% or 720 of 1781 subjects had true negative assay results). The
Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the assay was 9.8%. The Likelihood Ratio Negative
(LRN) of the assay was 0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.04; 0.23). The Likelihood
Ratio positive (LRP) of the assay was 1.61 (95%CI:1.51; 1.69). The results showed that the
clinical performance of the i-STAT TBI Plasma test is characterized by high clinical
sensitivity and high NPV comparable to that demonstrated by the Banyan BTI (DEN170045;
clinical sensitivity = 97.5%, clinical specificity = 36.5%, NPV = 99.6%, PPV = 9.2%), which
supports clinical utility as an aid in the evaluation of the need for a CT scan in subjects
presenting with a GCS score of 13 to 15 and a Not Elevated i-STAT TBI Plasma test result.

differences between head injury characteristics did not translate into statistically significant
differences in assay performance.

Since specimens from the ALERT-TBI study were archived frozen samples, a specimen
stability study was conducted to demonstrate the integrity of clinical samples, as per special
control b(1)(ii)(i) of 21 CFR 866.5830. The study demonstrated stability of plasma samples
covering a range of GFAP and UCH-L1 antigen levels stored frozen at -70° C.
b. Clinical performance with fresh plasma samples from the TRACK-TBI Phase 2 study
A supplemental clinical validation of the GFAP and UCH-L1 cut-offs was performed for
fresh plasma samples, the intended use matrix for the i-STAT TBI Plasma test. In order to
validate the GFAP and UCH-L1 cut-offs in fresh plasma samples, an additional clinical
validation study was performed using fresh plasma samples prepared from K EDTA venous
3
whole blood prospectively collected from subjects participating in the Traumatic Brain Injury
Specimen Collection and Testing Study (TRACK) TBI Phase 2 study (Protocol Number
9XY-02-TBI06). Only the plasma specimens which were collected in accordance with the
proposed intended use of the i-STAT TBI Plasma test were included in the analysis (n=88).
The demographic characteristics of the evaluable subjects are presented in the table below.

**Information not collected
Samples were evaluated at four clinical sites in the U.S., with operators of the test blinded to
the CT results associated with the study subjects. The subject’s CT scan images were
independently evaluated by a minimum of two U.S. board-certified radiologists blinded to
the i-STAT TBI Plasma result and each other’s evaluation to determine the presence or
absence of an acute intracranial lesion. If consensus was not established, the head CT scan
images for those subjects were evaluated independently by a third U.S. board-certified
radiologist in order to make a final determination of the CT scan result. A head CT scan
result of a subject was classified as positive if intracranial lesions were present. The
intracranial lesions were defined as any trauma-induced or related finding visualized upon
head CT scan, and may have included acute epidural hematomas, acute subdural hematomas,
indeterminate extra-axial lesions, cortical contusions, parenchymal hematomas, non-
hemorrhagic contusions, ventricle compression, ventricular trapping, brain herniation,
intraventricular hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, subarachnoid hemorrhage, petechial
hemorrhage, global or focal brain edema and post traumatic ischemia.
To estimate clinical performance characteristics, the i-STAT TBI Plasma test result was
compared to the consensus head CT scan result for each patient. The performance estimates
are summarized in the 2x2 table below. Of the 88 evaluable subjects, 29 had positive CT scan
results. Of the 29 subjects with positive CT scan results, 29 had an Elevated i-STAT TBI test
result (clinical sensitivity = 100%). The rate of false negative (FN) results was 0% (0/29). Of
the 59 subjects with negative CT scan results, 14 had a Not Elevated i-STAT TBI Plasma test
result (14/59, clinical specificity = 23.7%). The rate of False Positive (FP) results was 76.3%
(45/59). Overall, there were 14 subjects with Not Elevated i-STAT TBI Plasma test results,
all of which had negative CT scan results. The Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the assay
was 100% (14/14). The potential benefit of the assay would be a reduction in unnecessary CT
scans by approximately 24% (23.7% or 14 of 59 subjects had true negative assay results).
The Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the assay was 39.2%. The results show that the i-
STAT TBI Plasma test, when evaluated with fresh plasma samples, is characterized by high
sensitivity and NPV supportive of its clinical utility as an aid in the evaluation of the need for
a CT scan in subjects presenting with a GCS score of 13 to 15 and a negative i-STAT TBI
Plasma test.
