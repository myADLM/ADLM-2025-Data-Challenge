VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
The performance of the modified instruments was evaluated by using BD Multitest 6-colcor
TBNK with Trucount Tubes (K060375) as a representative reagent. As the BD FACSLyric Flow
Cytometer with the integrated BD FACSDuet Sample Preparation System represents the more
complex configuration and uses the same flow cytometer with some minor differences in sample
loader comparing to the modified BD FACSLyric Flow Cytometer without FACSDuet, the
analytical performance was validated only on the integrated system.

All results below met the manufacturer’s pre-specified acceptance criteria.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and reproducibility studies were performed based on CLSI guidance document
EP05-A3, Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved
Guideline-Third Edition.
The precision study was performed by testing Streck CD Chex plus Normal (CDN) and
Streck CD Chex CD4 Low (CDL) as stable samples. Daily measurements were obtained in
two separate runs (separated by at least two hours from the start of the first run’s acquisition
to the start of second run’s acquisition) over 21 testing days. System precision performance
for the enumeration of the T-, B- and NK- lymphocyte subset percentages and absolute
counts was evaluated across three FACSLyric Flow Cytometer with the integrated BD
FACSDuet Sample Preparation systems, executed by three operators using three reagent lots
for each assay through the study. The precision based on the results of absolute counts and
percentage lymphocytes are summarized in the following tables:

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the assay run on the BD FACSLyric Flow Cytometer with the integrated BD
FACSDuet Sample Preparation System was performed based on CLSI EP6-A, Evaluation of
the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved
Guideline.
Triplicate measurements of 11 lymphocyte subsets covering the anticipated linear ranges
were tested using three reagent lots on three different BD FACSLyric Flow Cytometer with
the integrated BD FACSDuet Sample Preparation Systems. In addition, seven supplemental
concentration levels for CD4 were used to evaluate linearity over the medical decision point
at 50 and 250 cells/μL for CD4 absolute counts. The results of the absolute counts in
supporting the linear range for each subset are summarized in the following table:
Subset Linear Range (cells/µL)
CD3+ 5 – 5282
CD3+CD4+ 3 – 3188
CD3+CD8+ 2 – 3268
CD19+ 0 – 2295
CD16+CD56+ 1 – 1287
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Not applicable
4. Accuracy (Instrument):
The study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP09c, Measurement Procedure
Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples by testing 370 samples at three
different clinical sites (minimum 40 samples/site) to demonstrate the equivalence of the BD
FACSLyric Flow Cytometer with the integrated BD FACSDuet Sample Preparation System
to the FACSLyric Flow Cytometer using manual sample preparation (predicate). CD4+ bins
were designed to cover the analytical measuring range (AMR). Each sample was stained with
BD Multicolor 6-color TBNK reagents and run on one new instrument system and one
predicate instrument at each site. Deming regression analysis was performed with all data
combined for each subset, and the results of the absolute counts and percentage lymphocytes
are summarized in the following tables:

5. Carry-Over:
The carryover studies were performed based on CLSI H26-A2, Validation, Verification, and
Quality Assurance of Automated Hematology Analyzers; Approved Standard- Second
Edition.
Specimen Carryover
Specimen carry over studies were performed to determine whether results were affected by
contamination from neighboring samples. System carryover was evaluated by estimating the
percent carryover of abnormally high leukocyte count samples to abnormally low leukocyte
count samples. Fifty-four (54) samples were acquired for high and 54 samples were acquired
for the low leukocyte concentrations across three FACSLyric Flow Cytometer with the
integrated BD FACSDuet Sample Preparation Systems from a total of six donors. Specimen
to specimen carryover results across all three instruments and donors was < 0.2% (i.e., 2000
ppm v/v).
Bleach to specimen carryover was evaluated on three different BD FACSLyric Flow
Cytometer with the integrated BD FACSDuet Sample Preparation Systems by performing the
end of the day clean maintenance task using bleach and the pipetting deionized water in each
specimen tube. This was repeated 12 times with 12 different specimen tubes which were
combined into one tube to measure the residual bleach. Bleach to specimen carryover over all
three instruments was < 0.00002% (i.e., 0.2 ppm v/v).
Reagent Carryover
The reagent carryover within the BD FACSLyric Flow Cytometer with the integrated BD
FACSDuet Sample Preparation Systems was evaluated by measuring optical density of FITC
and PBS reagents using a spectrophotometer, before and after 100 cycles of reagent probe
dispenses and washes, to assess the adequacy of probe washes to prevent contamination. The
reagent carryover was found to be < 0.01% (i.e., 100 ppm v/v).
B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
determined per CLSI EP17-A2, Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory
Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline.

For LoB, five donor samples with a minimum of 60 replicates per reagent lot, were evaluated
across four days using three different BD FACSLyric Flow Cytometer with the integrated
BD FACSDuet Sample Preparation Systems. There were 194 data points collected in total for
three reagent lots.
For LoD, four low concentration samples with a minimum of 60 replicates per reagent lot
were evaluated across four days using three different BD FACSLyric Flow Cytometer with
the integrated BD FACSDuet Sample Preparation Systems for low concentration samples per
reagent lot. The samples were cell-free plasma reconstituted with normal donor whole blood
to a concentration of 10 + 5 CD4 cells/uL. A total of 180 points were collected in total for
three reagent lots.
For LoQ, four low concentration pools were created by diluting normal whole blood with cell
free plasma to achieve CD4 absolute counts of 10, 20, 30 and 50 cells/μL. Fifteen replicates
were prepared from each of the concentration pools and were stained with three different
reagent lots. Ten replicates from each of the concentration pools were run on three different
BD FACSLyric Flow Cytometer with the integrated BD FACSDuet Sample Preparation
System whereas five replicates were run on the BD FACSLyric Flow cytomter (predicate
device).
The determined LoB, LoD and LoQ are shown in the following table:
LoB LoD LoQ

2. In-use Reagent Stability Performance:
The study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP25-A, Evaluation of Stability of In
Vitro Diagnostic Reagents to evaluate the in-use reagent stability of the Multitest 6-color
TBNK on the FACSDuet instrument for a minimum of 5 days with the vials remaining
uncapped for 8 hours per day inside the FACSDuet instrument. The enumeration of CD3+,
CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD19+ and CD16+CD56+ was tested over three different BD
FACSLyric Flow Cytometer with the integrated BD FACSDuet Sample Preparation Systems
using three reagent lots. The unopened vials stored refrigerated (2–8 ºC) from the same lots
were used as control reagents. Samples that were stained with control reagents were either
prepared by Automated sample preparation and acquired on the subject device or by manual
preparation and acquired on unintegrated FACSLyric flow cytometer (predicate device). The
results for the absolute counts and percentage lymphocytes between the test (Day 5) and the
control reagents for the automatic sample preparation and manual sample preparation method
are summarized in the following table:

3. Equivalence between 15- and 30-minutes Incubation time:
The study was performed to demonstrate the equivalency between the sample staining
incubation time of 15 minutes for the manual preparation versus the staining incubation time
of 15–30 minutes on the FACSDuet instrument for the following four comparisons:
a. Between FACSDuet 30 minutes incubation time and manual sample preparation 15
minutes incubation time.
b. Between 15 and 30 minutes incubation time using manual sample preparation.
c. Between FACSDuet and manual sample preparation using incubation time of 15 minutes.
d. Between FACSDuet and manual sample preparation using incubation time of 30 minutes.
For each of the four sample preparation types, 12 donor samples with 5 replicates per donor
(60 replicates in total) were tested for enumeration of the CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+,
CD19+ and CD16+CD56+ cells. Mean bias (%) of absolute counts for all four comparisons
were calculated and the results support the equivalence between 15 and 30 minutes
incubation time.
4. Equivalency of Software for the BD FACSLyric Flow Cytometer:
There were three software versions (v1.1.1, v1.3 and v1.4) releases from the predicate (v 1.0,
predicate) to the current modified BD FACSLyric Flow Cytometer (v 1.4). Equivalency of
software versions between the predicate system and the subject device was performed as
follows:
Equivalency between software v1.1.1 and v1.3
A study was performed to evaluate the optical equivalence between the predicate instrument
(the BD FACSLyric 10-color configuration with software v1.1.1) and subject device (the BD
FACSLyric 12-color configuration with software v1.3.). The clinical samples containing both
HIV positive patient samples and normal samples were tested for absolute enumeration of the
lymphocyte subsets on three subject instruments and three predicate instruments using three
reagent lots. The results for the absolute counts and percentage lymphocytes are summarized
in the following table:
