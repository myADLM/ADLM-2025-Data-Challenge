A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
MultiSure GK Link Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System is comprised of the
MultiSure GK Blood Glucose and Ketone Meter, the MultiSure GK Blood Glucose Test Strips,
and the MultiSure GK Blood Ketone test strips.
The MultiSure GK Linle Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System is intended to
quantitatively measure blood glucose or blood ketone in fresh capillary whole blood drawn from
fingertips. The system is intended for self-testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by
people with diabetes mellitus at home as an aid in monitoring the effectiveness of diabetes
control and should only be used by a single patient and it should not be shared. It is not intended
for diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
• This device is not intended for use in healthcare or assisted-use settings such as hospitals,
physician offices, or long-term care facilities because it has not been cleared by FDA for use

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The MultiSure GK Link Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System consists of the
MultiSure GK Link Blood Glucose and Ketone Meter, MultiSure GK Blood Glucose test strips,
MultiSure GK Blood Ketone test strips, Contrex Plus 4 Glucose Control Solution (Level 1, Level
2 and Level 3), and KET-1 ketone control solution (Level 1 and Level 2). The MultiSure GK
Blood Glucose test strips, MultiSure GK Blood Ketone test strips, Contrex Plus 4 Glucose
Control Solution, and KET-1 ketone control solution can be purchased separately.
MultiSure GK Link Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System enables automatic
transmission of stored data from the meter to a mobile device via USB cable (optional), or
through Bluetooth when the meter is properly configured.
B Principle of Operation:
The system uses amperometric technology for the detection of glucose and β-ketones. The
glucose test strips contain an enzyme (glucose oxidase) that reacts to glucose present in blood,
releasing electrons. The ketone test strips contain an enzyme (D-3-hydroxybutyrate
dehydrogenase) that reacts with ketones present in blood, releasing electrons. The meter applies
a small electrical current to the test strip and measures changes in the current caused by the
reaction of glucose or ketone in the blood sample to the enzyme in the test strip. The meter
converts the measured current into blood glucose or ketone reading that is displayed on the
meter’s display. Both the glucose and ketone test strips are plasma calibrated.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
MultiSure GK Link Blood Glucose and Ketone Meter
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples are to be tested immediately upon collection.
4. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The meter is automatically
coded.
5. Quality Control:
The sponsor manufactures three (3) levels of Contrex Plus 4 Glucose Control Solutions and
(2) levels of KET-1 ketone control solutions. Each test strip vial includes a control solution
range for each level. The user is instructed to compare the control results with the expected
control ranges printed on the strip vial. Users are given instructions on when to conduct
control solution testing and to call customer service if repeat testing with control material is
K201880 - Page 3 of 15

--- Page 4 ---
out of range. The user is instructed to switch the meter manually to control testing mode prior
to the application of control solutions to allow for control solution results to be marked with
“ctl” when stored in the meter’s memory and not be included in the result averages.

Intermediate precision was performed using two levels of β-ketone control solutions (0.1-0.7
and 1.4-2.0 mmol/L). Testing was conducted over 10 days with three test strip lots and 10

2. Linearity:
Glucose linearity from 20 to 600 mg/dL was previously established in k141036.
The ketone linearity of MultiSure GK Link Blood Ketone Monitoring System was evaluated
using venous whole blood spiked with β-hydroxybutyrate. Seven whole blood samples were
adjusted to the following β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations: 0.06, 0.55, 2.11, 4.49, 6.12,
7.35, and 8.40 mmol/L. The concentrations were assigned using the Beckman Coulter
AU480 analyzer with STANBIO β-Hydroxybutyrate LiquiColor Test Kit.
The summary of the linear regression analysis for each lot was as follow:
Lot # Slop y-intercept R2 value
Lot 1 0.9833 0.0542 0.9992
Lot 2 0.9909 0.0357 0.9992
Lot 3 0.9928 0.0298 0.9993
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed (β-ketone) measuring range of 0.1-0.8
mmol/L.
Validation testing was performed demonstrating that the meter displays a flashing Ket icon
and ‘HI” when the ketone measurement result is greater than 8.0 mmol/L and a flashing Ket
icon with “LO” when the ketone measurement result is less than 0.1 mmol/L as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Glucose interference was previously established in k141036.

To evaluate the effect of potential interfering exogenous and endogenous substances on the
ketone measurement function, three venous whole blood samples with ketone concentrations
of 0-0.8 mmol/L, 2.0-3.5 mmol/L and 5.0-7.0 mmol/L were used. Each sample was divided
into a control sample (with no added interferent) and a test sample (with added potential
interferent). The results from the test samples obtained using the candidate system were
compared to the results obtained with the control samples using the candidate system. The
sponsor defined no significant interference as bias within 0.3 mmol/L for β-ketone < 1.5
mmol/L and ≤ 20% for β-ketone ≥1.5 mmol/L. The following table lists the highest tested
concentration of each substance at which no significant interference was detected.

on the Beckman Coulter AU480 analyzer.
Test Strip Stability
Both the MultiSure GK Blood Glucose Test Strips and the MultiSure GK Ketone Glucose
Test Strips are provided packaged in vials and as individually wrapped single strips.
Shelf-life and open vial stability for the MultiSure GK Blood Glucose Test Strips were
previously evaluated in k141036 to support the claimed shelf life of 24 months when stored
under conditions of 39-86°F and a relative humidity of 10-85% and a 6 month open vial
claim when stored under these same conditions.
Shelf-life for the individually wrapped MultiSure GK Blood Glucose Test Strips was
assessed with real-time testing. The study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed
and found acceptable to support the sponsor’s claimed shelf-life stability of 24 months when
stored at recommended storage conditions of 39-86°F (10-30°C) and 10-85% relative
humidity.
Shelf-life and open vial stability for the MultiSure GK Ketone Test Strips were evaluated
using real-time testing. Study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
acceptable to support the sponsor’s claimed shelf life of 18 months when stored at the
recommended storage conditions of 39-86°F (10-30°C) and 10-85% relative humidity and an
open vial stability of 3 months when stored under these same conditions.
Shelf-life for the individually wrapped MultiSure GK Ketone Test Strips was previously
evaluated in k182593 to support the claimed shelf life of 18 months when stored under

sample volume for ketone.
Infection Control:
The device system is intended for single patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed previously in k131750 on the materials comprising the meter by an outside
commercial testing lab demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the
chosen disinfectant, Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Registration # 67619-
12). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no
change in ketone or glucose performance or external materials of the meter after 260 cleanings
and disinfection steps with the Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal wipes. The robustness
studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for
adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Flex Studies:
Studies were performed to assess the effect of the following on both the glucose and ketone
measurement functions of the candidate system: used test strip insertion, test strip removal
during measurement countdown, intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, and dropping. The
testing demonstrated that the MultiSure GK Link Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System
is robust to these use scenarios and that either an error message is returned, or an accurate result
is displayed.
EMC:
EMC testing was certified and compliance certificates provided documenting that acceptable
electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed.
Glucose Test Strip Lot Release Protocol:
Glucose test strip lot release protocols and criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
