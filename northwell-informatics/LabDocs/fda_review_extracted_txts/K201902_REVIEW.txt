I. Device Description:
The MammaPrint® FFPE test is performed at Agendia’s two central Laboratories, one
located in Netherland and the other one in California, USA. The test is a microarray based
gene expression analysis of RNA extracted from FFPE breast tumor tissue. The test is a
custom-designed array chip manufactured by Agilent Technologies using the Agilent
oligonucleotide microarray platform which assesses the mRNA expression of the 70 genes
printed in nine-fold.
The MammaPrint® FFPE analysis is designed to determine the expression of specific genes
in a tissue sample. The result is an expression profile, or “fingerprint”, of the sample. Using
this expression profile, the MammaPrint® FFPE Index is calculated and the molecular
prognosis profile of the sample is determined (Low Risk, High Risk).

L. Test Principle:
The MammaPrint® FFPE is a microarray based gene expression analysis of breast tumor
tissue. The analysis is based on several processes: isolation of RNA from FFPE breast cancer
tissue sections; elimination of gDNA, reverse transcription of RNA resulting in cDNA;
amplification and labeling of the cDNA; hybridization of the amplified and labeled cDNA to
the diagnostic microarray; washing and scanning the diagnostic microarray and data
acquisition (feature extraction); calculation and determination of the risk of recurrence.
Briefly, the amplified and labeled cDNA is hybridized to slides at 600C for 17 hours in a
rotation oven. By hybridization only complementary cDNA will bind to a 60-mer oligo on
the array. For scanning the MammaPrint® FFPE microarray, an Agilent microarray D-
Scanner (Part Number G5761AA) is used. The Agilent DNA microarray scanner is a 48-slide
scanning system that can read 1" x 3" glass slide microarrays. The result after scanning is a
scan file (multi-page TIFF). This TIFF contains two pages, one page for each dye used.
These are used by the feature extraction software.
Agilent Feature Extraction Software opens the multipage TIFF and combines those into one
image which shows a pattern of differently colored spots. The Feature Extraction Software
analyses the scan file (TIFF) by determining the intensities of the individual features,
subtracting background signal, perform normalization, and calculate ratios, errors and p-
values for each spot. The feature extraction software uses the MammaPrint® FFPE
microarray chip design file as a template in order to identify control features, normalization
features and reporter features. The fluorescent intensity of the features is a measure for the
activity of that particular gene.

Data analysis is performed according to a specific MammaPrint ® FFPE algorithm
(MammaPrint® Index, or MPI). The algorithm calculates the correlation of the sample
expression profile to a template (the mean expression profile of 44 tumors with a known
good clinical outcome) and determines the molecular profile of the sample. This algorithm is
designed and programmed by Agendia and compiled into a standalone software program, X-
Print Analysis Software. The X-Print Analysis Software version 3.2.0 loads a data file (CSV)
which is created by the laboratory technician by extracting specific information from the
laboratory database. The X-Print Analysis Software version 3.2.0 reads the CSV file, opens
the Feature Extraction Software data files (TXT), performs quality control checks,
determines the sample expression profile, calculates the correlation of sample profile to the
"Low Risk" template profile on a scale of -1.000 to +1.000 (MammaPrint® FFPE reportable
range), compares the calculated correlation to a pre-defined cut-off value and determines the
samples prognostic profile (i.e., Low Risk, High Risk, Low Risk Borderline, or High Risk
Borderline).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Refer to the Analytical Performance section in Decision Summary of K141142 for the
complete performance characteristics summary.
i. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision assessment of both SureScan Dx D-scanners versus the predicate C-scanners
was performed using four samples. These samples are routinely used as diagnostic controls
for MammaPrint and included two low risk samples with one being around device cut-off
and two high risk samples. The samples had a known MammaPrint result and covered all
MammaPrint categorical results (i.e. high risk, low risk, border line). In order to assess the
precision of both SureScan Dx D-scanners versus the predicate C-scanners, the variability of
repeated measurements between the C- and D-scanners were compared using the F-test.
The results from both the SureScan Dx D-scanners and the predicate C-scanners are plotted
over time (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Over time MammaPrint measurements obtained for the four control samples
collected on both SureScan Dx D-scanners and the predicate C-scanners.
Table 1 shows the control sample measurements for each of the two SureScan Dx D-
scanners, their related mean and standard deviation as well as the mean and standard
deviation based on the predicate C-scanner measurement. The p-values for all control
samples were above the significance level of 0.05, which shows that there is no statistically
significant difference in precision between the C- and D-scanners (Table 2).

(US45103019 and US811R3213). Subsequently, these were scanned a second time on the
SureScan Dx D-scanners, SG18309119 and SG18449122. The text files generated as output
were used to generate MammaPrint indices according to standard procedures. The samples
included in this dataset covered the entire MammaPrint readout range (-1 to +1), including
the borderline region ( -0.070 to +0.070 for single measurement). MammaPrint indices were
compared between both C- and D-scanners using Passing and Bablok regression. The
MammaPrint categorical results (i.e., high-risk, low-risk) were compared using a 2x2
contingency table after which concordance, Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) and Positive
Percent Agreement (PPA) were determined.
The Passing and Bablok regression comparing the MammaPrint indices between the C-
scanners and SureScan Dx scanner SG18309119 was y=0.00 +1.00 x (95% CI – slope: 1.000
– 1.002, 95% CI intercept: -0.0002 to 0.000) (Figure 2A). The Passing and Bablok
regression comparing the MammaPrint indices between the C-scanners and SureScan Dx
scanner SG18449122 was y=0.0010 +1.00 x (95%CI – slope: 1.000 – 1.0021, 95%CI
intercept: 0.0014 to 0.001) (Figure 2B). The Passing and Bablok regression analysis for both
SureScan Dx D-scanners had a slope that was equal to 1 with an intercept close or equal to
zero, indicating a high concordance in MammaPrint index between the SureScan Dx D-
scanners and the predicate C-scanners. Concordance, NPA and PPA of MammaPrint
categorical results were identical between the two SureScan Dx D-scanners and the predicate
C-scanners (Tables 2, 3). The lower bound of the 95% CI of both NPA and PPA were both
above 85%. The overall concordance in MammaPrint categorical result between the predicate
C-scanners and the SureScan Dx D-scanners, SG18309119 and SG18449122 was 99.7% and
100%, respectively. In this method comparison study of C-scanners and D-scanners,
SG18309119 and SG18449122, the NPA was 100 % (95%CI, 98.1 – 100) and 100%
(95%CI, 97.1 – 100), the PPA was 99.3% (95%CI: 96.0 – 99.9) and 100% (95%CI: 97.5 -
100), respectively.

Bin 1 ranges from +1 to +0.36. The MammaPrint index threshold 0.36 was defined by
Delahaye et al., and clinical utility was shown in the study by Esserman et al. where patients
from the STO-3 clinical trial with a MammaPrint index above +0.36 had a very low
recurrence even after 20 years (Delahaye et al., 2017; Esserman et al., 2017). Bin 2 is
between +0.36 and 0. Bin 3 is between 0 and -0.57. Bin 4 ranges from a MammaPrint index -
0.57 to -1. The MammaPrint index threshold -0.57 was defined in the I-SPY 2 protocol
(clincaltrials.gov, NCT01042379) as the median high risk score in I-SPY 1 study patients,
and aimed to create the distinction High 1 and High 2 (or ultrahigh) which has since been
used in the randomization of the I-SPY 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01042379; Park et al.,
2016; Wolf et al., 2017; Nanda et al., 2020).
The observed risk within each bin as listed in Table 4 shows that the rate of events increases
with a decreasing index. Bootstrapping was used for deriving a robust estimate of the 95%
confidence interval for the proportion (Table 4, Figure 3A). Kaplan Meier analysis for the 5-
year Distant Recurrence Risk (DR-risk) within each bin was performed (Table 4, Figure
3B). The analysis shows a trend between MammaPrint Index and the DR-risk as such with a
decreasing index, an increasing DR-risk is observed.

representation of MammaPrint index of the 5-year Distant Recurrence Risk based on Kaplan

Cox regression analysis was performed to show a correlation between MammaPrint index
and risk of recurrence (Table 5). With each increase in MammaPrint index unit, there is a
0.224 (i.e., 4.5-fold) decrease in recurrence risk at 5 years. Separate analysis by risk groups is
presented in Tables 6 and 7. Analysis for the high-risk group shows a 0.695 (i.e., 1.4-fold)
decrease in recurrence risk at 5 years with each increase in MammaPrint index unit. Cox
regression analyses for the low risk group is biased by the low number of events (n=2) which
affects the Cox regression model and results as apparent from a large confidence interval.
The two events had a MammaPrint index of 0.282 and 0.297, and are closely grouped
together. In the trajectory from 0 to +1, these two events result in an HR of 5.587, as the two

events are close together and in the first part of the trajectory there are no events. Analyzing
the model on the full MammaPrint range was not affected by low number of events.

The categorical analysis and the Cox regression model demonstrate that there is a correlation
between the change in the MammaPrint index and the clinical outcome for the RASTER
study, thus supporting the inclusion of the MammaPrint index score in the assay report.

F. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
i. Software Validation
No fundamental changes were implemented to the MammaPrint index software since the
clearance of the predicate device. The current revision in XPrint software from version 2.24
to version 3.2.0 was made to recognize and accept data from the SureScan Dx scanner, part
number G5761AA. There were also minor bug fixes, quality improvements, and usability
improvements, as well as maintenance activities. However, the algorithm to calculate the
MammaPrint index based on the intensities of the probes was the same as the predicate
device. The changes were validated under Agendia’s quality systems management. The risk
associated with the changes was determined to be Moderate, similar to the predicate device.
Therefore, the new version of XPrint software does not raise any new safety or effectiveness
concerns.
N. Proposed Labeling:
For health care provider ordering the MammaPrint® test, two labeling documentations listed
below are provided in the sample collection kit.
• Specimens Sampling Instructions
• Physician’s Brochure
Upon completion of the MammaPrint® FFPE test, the ordering health care provider will
receive MammaPrint® FFPE results for the risk determination. There are four (4) different
patient report forms, i.e., high risk, low risk, borderline high risk, and borderline low risk.
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
The device is classified as Class II under regulation 21 CFR 862.6040 with special controls.
