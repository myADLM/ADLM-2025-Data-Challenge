III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The LZI Oxycodone III Enzyme Immunoassay is intended for the qualitative and semi-
quantitative determination of oxycodone in human urine at the cutoff values of 100 ng/mL and
300 ng/mL when calibrated against oxycodone. The assay is designed for prescription use with a
number of automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as GC/MS
or LC/MS, or (2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative chemical
method (e.g., gas or liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry) must be used in order to
obtain a confirmed analytical result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result is
positive.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Performance characteristics have been validated on the Beckman Coulter® AU480 clinical
analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The LZI Oxycodone III Enzyme Immunoassay is a kit comprised of two reagents, an R1 and R2
which are bottled separately but sold together within the kit. The LZI Oxycodone III Enzyme
Immunoassay is traceable to a commercially available oxycodone standard.
The R1 solution contains mouse monoclonal anti-oxycodone antibody, glucose-6-phosphate
(G6P) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers, and sodium azide (0.09 %) as a
preservative. The R2 solution contains glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled
with oxycodone in buffer with sodium azide (0.09 %) as a preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
The LZI Oxycodone III Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with
ready-to-use liquid reagents. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and
K202007 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount
of antibody in the reagent. The drug-labeled G6PDH conjugate is traceable to a commercially
available oxycodone standard and referred to as oxycodone-labeled G6PDH conjugate. Enzyme
activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, and the drug concentration in the sample is
measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the absence of drug in the sample, oxycodone-labeled
G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody, and the enzyme activity is inhibited. If free drug is
present in the sample, the antibody would bind to free drug; the unbound oxycodone-labeled
G6PDH then exhibits its maximal enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that can be measured
spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the assay was evaluated in qualitative and semi-quantitative
mode.
All samples were run in replicates of two, with two runs a day for 22 days on one Beckman
Coulter® AU480 automated clinical analyzer for a total of 88 results per concentration.
The oxycodone sample concentrations were prepared by spiking oxycodone into negative
urine samples, and all concentrations for the precision studies were confirmed by LC/MS
testing. Results are summarized below:

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity
The cross-reactivity of structurally related compounds was tested by spiking each potential
cross-reactant into pooled negative human urine and then evaluating the sample with the
candidate assay. Results are summarized below using the 100 ng/mL cutoff. Results
obtained using the 300 ng/mL cutoff were nearly identical.

Interference Testing - Drugs
Potential interference from structurally unrelated compounds was evaluated by spiking a high
concentration (as noted in the table below) of the potential interferent into two sample
aliquots with oxycodone concentrations at -25% and +25% of the cutoff concentration.
Samples were then evaluated with the candidate assay and the results are summarized below.
There were no deviations from the expected positive or negative results.

Potential interference from endogenous compounds and urine preservatives was also
evaluated in a separate study. Results indicated that there is interference from boric acid at
1000 mg/dL. No other compounds showed interference concentrations at the concentrations
tested. Results are summarized below:

Boric acid at 1000 mg/dL was found to cause false negative results at +25 and +50% of the
cutoff. The following limitation is included in the device labeling: Boric Acid at 1% w/v
may cause false negative results. Boric Acid is not recommended as a preservative for urine.
Effect of pH
The sponsor evaluated the effect of pH on the results by preparing aliquots with oxycodone
concentrations at -25% and +25% of the cutoff and adjusting the pH from 3 to 11 in
increments of one pH unit. There were no deviations from the expected positive or negative
results.
Effect of specific gravity
The sponsor evaluated the effect of specific gravity on the results by preparing aliquots with
oxycodone concentrations at -25% and +25% of the cutoff and adjusting the specific gravity

4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The LZI Oxycodone III Enzyme Immunoassay is traceable to a commercially available
oxycodone standard.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The performance of the assay around the claimed cutoffs is presented in sections VII.A.1 and
VII.A.2 above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
For the 100 ng/mL cutoff, the sponsor conducted a method comparison study using 82
unaltered clinical urine samples comparing results on the candidate device to those using a
validated LC-MS/MS method. Since the assay demonstrated 100% cross-reactivity with
oxymorphone, samples were binned according to the sum of the oxycodone and
oxymorphone concentrations, which ranged from 0 to 400.0 ng/mL. The results were
identical between the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes and are summarized in the
tables below:
Near Cutoff

For the 300 ng/mL cutoff, the sponsor conducted a method comparison study using 90
unaltered clinical urine samples comparing results on the candidate device to those using a
validated LC-MS/MS method. Since the assay demonstrated 100% cross-reactivity with
oxymorphone, samples were binned according to the sum of the oxycodone and
oxymorphone concentrations, which ranged from 0 to 1302.5 ng/mL. There were slight
differences between the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes and results for both modes
are summarized in the tables below:
