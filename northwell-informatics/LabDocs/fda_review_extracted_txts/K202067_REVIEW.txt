B Principle of Operation:
The EliA SmDP-S Immunoassay is a semi-quantitative solid-phase fluoroimmunoassay for the
determination of IgG autoantibodies against Sm. The EliA SmDP-S test is fully integrated and
automated system which comprises assay-specific reagents, EliA method-specific reagents, and
general reagents.
The synthetic SmD peptide is immobilized on the EliA solid phase component (EliA Well). The
3
EliA wells are molded cups comparable to excised wells from a microtiter plate. If present in the
patient's specimen, antibodies to the SmD peptide bind to their specific antigen. After washing
3
away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG
Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound
conjugate is washed away, and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution.
After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The assay
directly measures the amount of antibody of interest bound to the antigen coated on the EliA
well, therefore the higher the value of fluorescent signal detected by the instrument, the higher
the amount of antibody bound and detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the
response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

2. Linearity:
Three patient serum samples (with concentration at 310.8 EliA U/mL, 230.5 EliA U/mL, 9.7
EliA U/mL on Phadia 250, and 329.3 EliA U/mL, 205.6 EliA U/mL, 10.4 EliA U/mL on
Phadia 2500E) were serially diluted with EliA Sample Diluent. Each dilution was tested in
triplicate on one lot of the EliA SmDP-S assay reagents and one set of system reagents on
Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500E instruments. The ratios of observed/expected values were
calculated. The observed values were graphed against the calculated values and a linear
regression analysis was performed. The results are summarized in the tables below.
Results on Phadia 250:

for Sm was found to be reactive in the EliA SmDP-S assay. Among the 10 sera in AMLI
Panel, none of samples which were known to be positive for SmB, SmB’, SmE, and SmF
was detected by the EliA SmDP-S assay.
Endogenous and Exogenous Interference:
Three serum samples with concentration at 3.0 EliA U/mL (negative), around 7 EliA U/mL
(within the equivocal range), and > 200 EliA U/mL (high positive) were spiked with the
different interfering substances or blank solution. The samples were tested in triplicate in two
runs using one lot of EliA SmDP-S Wells on Phadia 250. The % recovery for each sample
spiked with the interfering substance was calculated by comparing its result to that of the
corresponding control sample with blank solution. No significant interferences were
observed in the study up to the concentrations listed in the table below:
Compound No Interference up to

Rituximab 109 mg/dL
Infliximab 26.4 mg/dL
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range for the EliA SmDP-S is 0.8–310 EliA U/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
There is no international reference standard that recognizes the SmD peptide. The EliA IgG
3
Calibrators and EliA IgG Curve Controls are derived from a purchased immunoglobulin
preparation. The IgG calibrators are traceable via unbroken chain of calibrations to the
International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum Immunoglobulins A, G
and M from WHO. New batches of IgG calibrators are compared to a secondary standard
(standardized with the IRP) or to the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the
correct concentration.
Stability:
The stability for the EliA SmDP-S assay-specific reagent (EliA SmDP-S Wells) were
determined as follows:

Kit stability (shelf-life): The shelf-life of the EliA SmDP-S Wells was performed using
Phadia 250 instrument. Three lots of the wells were stored at 2–8°C and tested at four
timepoints (0, 7, 13, and 19 months) in triplicate determination. The wells were tested with
four positive samples in triplicate determination and with nine negative samples in single
determination with a full calibration curve. The EliA ANA Positive Control and the EliA
IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control were additionally tested in triple determination. The shelf-life
of the EliA SmDP-S assay was determined to be 18 months stored at 2–8°C.
Open-vial (in-use) stability: The stability of the EliA SmDP-S Wells stored at 2–8°C after
first opening of the foil bag was performed. The wells were tested at 4, 7 and 10 months in
two identical test runs with three positive samples in triple determination and two negative
samples in single determination. Each test run contained a full calibration curve. The in-use
stability for the EliA SmDP-S assay was determined to be 9 months at 2–8°C.
On-board stability: The on-board stability of EliA SmDP-S wells was tested over 4 weeks
using six samples (two positive, two equivocal and two negative) on the Phadia 250
instrument. The on-board stability EliA SmDP-S assay was determined to be 28 days at 2–
8°C.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), Limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of the EliA
SmDP-S assay were determined on both Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500E.
The LoB was determined from the measurement of four analyte-free samples tested in
quadruplicate per sample over six days using two lots of EliA SmDP-S reagents on two
instruments. The LoB was calculated as the 95th percentile for each lot (48 determinations).
LoB was determined as the higher value of these two lots for each type of instrument. The
claimed LoB for EliA SmDP-S assay is the greatest LoB across the two lots and both
instrument types.
The LoD was determined by testing four low-level samples in quadruplicate per sample over
six days using two lots of EliA SmDP-S reagents on two instruments. The LoD was
calculated based on 192 determinations with 96 blank and 96 low level replicates following
recommendations of CLSI document EP17-A and with proportions of false positives (α) less
than 5% and false negatives (β) less than 5%. The claimed LoD for EliA SmDP-S assay is the
greatest LoD across the two lots and both instrument types.
The LoQ was determined by testing four low-level samples in quadruplicate per sample over
six days using two lots of EliA SmDP-S reagents on two instruments. The LoQ was defined
to be the lowest concentration level that meets the within-laboratory imprecision of < 20%
for each lot. The greatest LoQ across the two lots and both instrument types were set as the
claimed LoQ for EliA SmDP-S assay.
The results are summarized in the table below:

E-module of the Phadia 2500E 0.4 0.7 0.8
The claim for both instrument types 0.4 0.7 0.8
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay cut-off and the equivocal range were established by testing a cohort consisting of
200 clinically defined disease control samples on a Phadia 250 instrument. The assay cut-offs
were set as follows:
Decision Point Interpretation
< 7 EliA U/mL Negative
7–10 EliA U/mL Equivocal
> 10 EliA U/mL Positive
In case of equivocal results, the manufacturer recommends retesting the patient after 8–12
weeks.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Six hundred twenty-eight (628) serum samples with antibody concentrations covering the
measuring range were analyzed with EliA SmDP-S and the predicate EliA SmDP. Among
them, 460 samples were found within the measuring ranges of both tests and used for the
method comparison analysis. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement
(NPA), and total agreement were calculated with equivocal results considered as negative or
as positive, respectively. The results are summarized in the tables below:

2. Matrix Comparison:
A total of 93 matched samples from 93 individual subjects with antibody concentrations
covering the measuring range were collected in serum and K3-EDTA plasma tubes. All
samples were run in single determination on a Phadia 250 instrument using one lot of EliA
SmDP-S reagents. A Passing-Bablok analysis was performed to evaluate the comparability
between matrices and the results are summarized in the table below:
Range tested Slope Intercept
N R²

Serum vs. 0.99 0.13
93 1.2–278.7 1.00
EDTA plasma (0.96–1.02) (-0.12–0.38)
The plasma preparation with heparin is not recommended because heparin interferes with the
measurement of Sm antibodies. The package insert of the EliA SmDP-S list the following
limitation: “Heparin can suppress SmD antibody reaction. Some EliA SmDP-S results in the
equivocal / low positive range obtained from Li-heparin plasma samples may be
underestimated.”
3. Instrument Comparison:
This study compared the performance of the Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500E instruments using
the EliA SmDP-S assay by evaluating 105 positive, 15 equivocal and 14 negative serum
samples. The samples were analyzed in single determination on one Phadia 250 and one
Phadia 2500E instrument each. The Passing-Bablok regression analysis showed the slope of
1.01 (95% CI: 0.90–1.10) and the intercept close to zero (0.73, 95% CI: 1.20– -0.36). The
PPA, NPA, and total agreement were calculated with equivocal results considered as negative
or as positive, respectively. The results are summarized in the tables below.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
A total of 328 clinically defined serum samples were included in the clinical evaluation for
the EliA SmDP-S. This validation cohort includes 104 samples from individuals diagnosed
with SLE, and 224 samples from patients with non-SLE diseases/conditions (mixed
connective tissue disease, Sjögren’s syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis/dermatomyositis,
rheumatoid arthritis, Graves’ disease, Hashimoto’s disease, bacterial infections, and viral
infections). Clinical sensitivity and specificity of the assay are summarized in the tables
