IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The GEM Hemochron 100 system is a battery-operated, point-of-care coagulation analyzer that
represents the next generation platform of the predicate Hemochron™ Signature Elite
microcoagulation system. Like the Hemochron Signature Elite instrument, the GEM Hemochron
100 is designed to be used with ACT+ and ACT-LR cuvettes in vitro diagnostic tests designed to
determine the Activated Clotting Time (ACT) of fresh whole blood samples at both low (ACT-
LR) and high (ACT+) levels of heparin doses. The GEM Hemochron 100 employs the same
fundamental opto-mechanical clot detection technology and the same analytical algorithms used
by the predicate device for calculating test results. The single-use test cartridges for Activated
Whole Blood Clotting Time Plus (ACT+) or Low Range ACT (ACT-LR) assays are identical to
the cartridges used by the predicate analyzer. Whole Blood Controls used on the GEM
Hemochron 100 system are identical to those used on the Hemochron™ Signature Elite. The
system is intended for use only in clinical settings requiring point-of-care testing. ACT results
for patient blood samples or liquid control material are displayed as ACT Celite-equivalent
values (CEV) in seconds, for both test types.
The analyzer contains a test chamber which warms a test cuvette to the required temperature, and
it performs all operations to measure the clotting time of a whole blood sample after it is placed
in the test cuvette and the test is started by the operator. The user interface includes a color touch
screen that displays various action keys and an external barcode scanner for reading Operator
K202101 - Page 3 of 22

--- Page 4 ---
identification number (OID), Patient identification (PID) number and lot numbers and expiration
dates of liquid quality controls (QC). The operator uses the touch screen to select a command, set
software configurations or enter information.
The GEM Hemochron 100 system is POCT1-A2 compliant and has Wi-Fi and Ethernet
networking capability. It has increased storage for 10,000 patient and QC records. ACT+ and
ACT-LR cartridge labels are modified to include a 2D barcode that identifies test type, lot
number and expiry date, which is readable by the internal camera. Quality control features such
as designation of QC levels, tagging of test results with date and time, and entry of OID and PID
numbers are included and are similar to the predicate device.
The device contains an 802.11 interface which supports WPA2 encryption as well as EAP
authentication framework. The device is able to connect to a Wireless Local Area Network
(WLAN) via 802.11 b/g/n connections at 2.4 and 5 GHz. The communications interfaces
supported by the device are utilized to configure or update the device software by supervisory
staff before deployment to the intended use environment and in the reporting of test results to the
Laboratory or Hospital Information Systems by the clinical operators at the point of care. Test
results are used directly at the point of care in aiding medical decision making, and the device’s
intended use is not reliant on the device’s ability to transmit the information to the LIS/HIS.

Activated Clotting Time Plus (ACT+) Test and Low Range Activated Clotting Time (ACT-
LR) Test Marketed with GEM Hemochron 100
Two types of test cartridges (cuvettes) are available with the GEM Hemochron 100. Each type of
cartridge is intended for one type of test.
• GEM Hemochron 100 Activated Clotting Time Plus (ACT+) Test
The GEM Hemochron 100 ACT+ test is a quantitative assay for monitoring anticoagulation
with moderate to high unfractionated heparin (UFH) doses in fresh whole blood samples.
This test is intended for monitoring UFH administered during cardiovascular surgery and
cardiac ablation procedures. The GEM Hemochron 100 ACT+ demonstrates sensitivity to
UFH concentrations of 1.0 to 6.0 units/mL. The GEM Hemochron 100 ACT+ test can be
performed on the GEM Hemochron 100 System and any model of Hemochron Signature
Series device.
GEM Hemochron 100 ACT+ cartridges are single-use disposable test devices with a well for
application of liquid QC and whole blood samples. When a liquid QC or patient test is
requested, the instrument prompts the Operator to insert a cartridge into the instrument. After
the instrument warms the cartridge, it prompts the Operator to apply the sample into the
sample well of the cartridge.
The ACT+ test cartridge is a self-contained disposable test chamber preloaded with a dried
preparation of silica, kaolin, phospholipid, stabilizers, and buffers that provide maximum
activation as defined by clinical practice guidelines. Each cartridge is sealed in a foil pouch
labeled with lot number and expiry date.
Reagents in GEM Hemochron 100 ACT+ cartridges are identical in composition to those in
the predicate Hemochron ACT+ cuvettes. A 2D barcode added to the cartridge label
identifies the test type, lot number and expiry date. This information is automatically read by
the internal camera.
• GEM Hemochron 100 Low Range Activated Clotting Time (ACT-LR) Test
The GEM Hemochron 100 ACT-LR (Low Range Activated Clotting Time) test is a
quantitative assay for monitoring anticoagulation with low to moderate unfractionated
heparin (UFH) doses in fresh whole blood samples. This test is intended for monitoring UFH
administered during extracorporeal life support, and cardiology procedures. The GEM
Hemochron 100 ACT-LR test demonstrates sensitivity to UFH concentrations up to 2.5
units/mL. The GEM Hemochron 100 ACT-LR test can be performed on the GEM
Hemochron 100 system and any model of Hemochron Signature Series device.
GEM Hemochron 100 cartridges are single-use disposable test devices with wells for
application of samples. When a patient test or an LQC test is requested, the instrument
prompts the Operator to insert a cartridge into the instrument. After the instrument warms the
cartridge, it prompts the Operator to apply the sample into the sample well of the cartridge.

Wi-Fi networking, and adds new and/or enhanced functionality. Enhancements in the GEM
Hemochron 100 system when compared to the predicate include:
• Color touchscreen
• 2D barcoded cartridges labels providing assay type, lot number and expiry date
• Camera to monitor clot detection and decode 2D barcodes on cartridge labels
• Expanded storage for OID and PID numbers, and patient and QC records
• Upgraded the OS from that of the predicate device to Android Nougat
• Improved communication interface with addition of Wi-Fi networking
B Principle of Operation:
The GEM Hemochron 100 system measures whole blood ACT using single-use disposable
cartridges. Each cartridge contains all of the reagents necessary for a specified test. The Operator
inserts a cartridge into the instrument where the internal camera reads the information from a
barcode. Once the cartridge is warmed to the specified temperature, the instrument prompts the
Operator to add a blood sample into the cartridge sample well. Testing is initiated by pressing the
Start Test icon on the touch screen. When the test begins, the instrument draws blood from the
sample well into the test channel of the cartridge, where the blood is mixed with the reagent. The
remaining blood sample, not needed for testing, is automatically drawn out of the sample well
and into an enclosed waste channel in the cartridge.
The instrument mixes the sample and reagent by pumping the mixture back and forth at a
predetermined rate within the test channel at a specified temperature. The optical system
(internal camera system) monitors the motion of the sample and reagent in the test channel. As
the blood begins to clot, the flow of the blood sample within the test channel is impeded, which
reduces its rate of flow. Flow reduction below a predetermined value signals to the instrument
that a fibrin clot has formed. An internal timer measures the elapsed time between the start of the
test and the clot formation. During the test, the elapsed time is displayed as ACT Celite-
equivalent values (CEV) in seconds. Upon completion of the test, the CEV is displayed and
recorded by the instrument.
Test results (patient tests, EQC tests, and LQC tests) are saved in the instrument internal
database. As many as 10,000 test results can be saved on the instrument. The results can also be
sent to a computer (HIS/LIS) on the network via the GEMweb Plus 500 middleware.
GEMweb Plus 500 is middleware compatible to communicate with the GEM Hemochron 100
system. It allows networking of a group of analyzers and provides remote access for managing
analytical devices and operator profiles. More specifically, the middleware is limited to sending
data on operator credentials, liquid quality control lot information, and test cartridge lot
information. In addition, the middleware can receive and relay test results from the GEM
Hemochron 100 instrument. The GEMweb Plus 500 middleware does not support software
upgrades, control of critical device settings and configurations, and initiation of alarms.
The GEM Hemochron 100 system includes Windows-based centralized configuration manager
(CCM) software that is substantially equivalent to Hemochron Configuration Manager (HCM)
software included with the predicate. HCM was originally cleared with the Hemochron™

Elite.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
GEM Hemochron 100 System
2. Specimen Identification:
Entry and control of Operator identification (OID) and Patient identification (PID) via touch
screen and/or barcode scanning.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Single-use disposable cartridges are used by the system. Each cartridge contains all of the
reagents necessary for a specified test. The operator inserts a cartridge into the instrument
where the internal camera reads the information from a barcode. Once the cartridge is
warmed to the specified temperature, the instrument prompts the operator to add a blood
sample into the cartridge sample well. Testing is initiated by pressing the Start Test icon on
the touch screen. When the test begins, the instrument draws blood from the sample well into
the test channel of the cartridge, where the blood is mixed with the reagent. The remaining
blood sample, not needed for testing, is automatically drawn out of the sample well and into
an enclosed waste channel in the cartridge.
4. Calibration:
Not applicable
5. Quality Control:
The GEM Hemochron 100 instrument should have two levels of quality control performed
every 8 hours of operation. This requirement can be accomplished by conducting internal
Electronic Quality Control (EQC) and/or external Liquid Quality Control (LQC) testing.
Performance of the GEM Hemochron 100 test cartridges should be validated with two levels
of LQC using directCHECK Quality Control products.

Lot-to-Lot Precision Study
A precision study using two lots of each cartridge (cuvette) type was performed to assess the
lot-to-lot variability. The study design involved one site, 20 days, two runs per day, two
replicates per run, across two lots of each cartridge type (ACT+ and ACT-LR), with each lot
run on four instruments by two operators. One lot of each directCHECK liquid quality
control level (Level 1 and Level 2) was used. At each LQC level, estimates of within-run,
between-run, between-day, between-instrument, between-operator, between-lot, and total
(within-laboratory) precision were obtained. The results, which all met acceptance criteria,
are summarized in the tables below. Overall, the study results demonstrated acceptable
precision across different lots of assay cartridge.

Whole Blood Precision
For the whole blood precision study, sample stability concerns warranted utilization of 10
instruments, two operators (each running five GEM Hemochron 100 instruments) each
performing two replicates of each sample (N=20). Five ACT levels were tested with ACT+
and four ACT levels were tested with ACT-LR. The ACT levels were targeted such that they
spanned the target measurement range of each assay. Each donor whole blood sample was
tested at only one heparin level (i.e., one target clotting time). Intravenous blood was
obtained and heparinized to the desired clotting time. ACT+ has a linear range of between
1.0 and 6.0 units/mL of heparin, and therefore samples other than baseline which contained
less than 1.0 units/mL of heparin were not tested. ACT-LR has a linear range of between 0
and 2.5 units/mL of heparin, and therefore only samples within this range were used.
Estimates of whole blood precision within-instrument, between-instrument, between operator
and within-laboratory were obtained and summary data for this study is provided in the tables
below. Overall, whole blood precision of GEM Hemochron 100 ACT+ and ACT-LR
cartridges met the acceptance criteria.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted, per CLSI EP06-A, to validate the linear range claim. Three
cartridge lots were evaluated with two donors for each cartridge lot, or a total of six donors
were tested for ACT+ and ACT-LR assay, respectively. Each donor’s blood sample
responded to heparin independently and a conclusion was made based on six sets of linearity
test data. Seven heparin concentration levels were tested for each donor with eight data
points by use of eight GEM Hemochron 100 instruments (i.e., one run on each instrument).
Correlation between readings from the GEM Hemochron 100 instrument and heparin levels
was evaluated by use of both linear and polynomial regression to define best fitting. Overall,
the ACT+ assay on the GEM Hemochron 100 instrument demonstrated linear correlation of
activated clotting time reading to heparin concentrations from 1.0 to 6.0 units/mL, and the
ACT-LR assay on the GEM Hemochron 100 instrument demonstrated linear correlation of
activated clotting time reading to heparin concentrations from 0 to 2.5 units/mL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
a. Internal Method Comparison Study
An internal method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the
ACT+ and ACT-LR assays on the GEM Hemochron 100 (GH100) platform versus the
Hemochron Signature Elite (SE) platform, and to determine whether the results are
statistically equivalent across the measurement range. The study utilized fresh whole blood
samples from healthy donors which were spiked with different concentrations of heparin to
cover the measurement range.
The study design involved samples from 40 individuals tested in duplicate for each assay
type (ACT+ and ACT-LR) and six instrument pairs (of GEM H100 and Signature Elite). One
lot of each ACT+ and ACT-LR cartridge type was used. For the ACT+ assays, samples were
tested at baseline and spiked with UFH to final concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and
6.0 units/mL. The results were compared and the bias was determined at medical decision
levels of 400s and 500s. For the ACT-LR assays, samples were tested at baseline and spiked
with UFH to final concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 units/mL. The results were
compared and the bias was determined at medical decision levels of 225s and 300s.
Passing-Bablok regression was performed using the first replicate obtained from each assay.
The results from the Passing-Bablok analysis for the first replicate are shown below for
ACT+ and ACT-LR assays. Slopes and intercepts, along with 95% confidence intervals,
were calculated from the respective regression fit. Correlation coefficients were also
computed. Overall, the results demonstrated that, for the levels of UFH tested, the results of
ACT+ and ACT-LR assays ran on the GEM Hemochron 100 were comparable to the results
of ACT+ and ACT-LR assays ran on the Hemochron Signature Elite.

b. External Method Comparison Study
In addition to the Internal Method Comparison study, an External Method Comparison study
was conducted at seven clinical sites in the United States, which were chosen for their
specific representation of different types of sites and conditions expected during commercial
clinical use, with trained users representative of point-of-care (POC) professional operators.
The study compared the GEM Hemochron 100 System against the predicate device
Hemochron Signature Elite using patient fresh whole blood samples destined for discard.
ACT+ cartridges were used in the cardiovascular operating room on patients with cardiac
disease undergoing various cardiac surgery procedures, as well as on patients necessitating
cardiac ablation in the electrophysiology lab. ACT-LR cartridges were used in various
settings on patients requiring extracorporeal life support (ECLS) due to underlying heart
and/or lung disease, as well as on patients with cardiac disease undergoing cardiac
catheterization. For each ACT subject sample tested, two GEM Hemochron 100 instruments
and two Hemochron Signature Elite instruments were needed. Each sample was assayed on
paired GEM Hemochron 100 and paired Hemochron Signature Elite instruments by at least
three trained operators at each site representative of POC users at a minimum of three clinical
sites per cartridge type (ACT+ or ACT-LR).
Analysis methodology included linear regressions using Passing-Bablok analysis with the
intercept and slope (along with the 95% confidence interval associated with each estimate),
Bland-Altman plots of differences, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r),
overall average bias and bias at predefined clinically important decision points. These values
were calculated for first replicate, at ranges appropriate for the cuvette type. The bias (with
95% confidence intervals) between GEM Hemochron 100 results and the Hemochron
Signature Elite predicate results was calculated from the regression fit at the reference
intervals (medical decision levels from Table 20). The results from the analysis using the first
replicate are shown below for ACT+ and ACT-LR assays.

Overall, the method comparison results demonstrated that, in the hands of point-of-care users
representative of the settings where the instrument would be used (e.g. cardiovascular
operating rooms, cardiac catheterization laboratories, electrophysiology laboratories, and
extracorporeal life support), the GEM Hemochron 100 instrument performs equivalently to
the predicate Hemochron Signature Elite instrument across the measurement range of ACT+
and ACT-LR test cartridges.

A study was conducted, per CLSI EP28-A3c, to establish the reference intervals for ACT+ and
ACT-LR assays (000GACT+ and 000GACT-LR cartridges) on the GEM Hemochron 100
platform. The intervals were established for both healthy normal donors and for non-heparinized
patients. The study included 120 donors for each subclass (normal donors and non-heparinized
patients) and for each assay type. A nonparametric 95% reference interval was established for
each subclass and 90% confidence interval limits were computed for each reference limit.
