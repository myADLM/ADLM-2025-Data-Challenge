III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The IDS Cortisol assay is an in vitro diagnostic device intended for the quantitative
determination of cortisol in human serum and plasma on the IDS system. Results are to be used
in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory data to assist clinicians in the diagnosis and
treatment of disorders of the adrenal gland.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
IDS-iSYS Multi-Discipline Automated System, i.e. IDS system
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The IDS Cortisol assay consists of a reagent cartridge. The reagent cartridge contains multiple
reagents:
• MPE1: Magnetic particles coated rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody in a phosphate
buffer with Proclin as preservative.
• CONJ: Cortisol coupled with an acridinium ester derivative in phosphate buffer with
Proclin as a preservative.
• mAb: Mouse anti-cortisol monoclonal antibody in phosphate buffer with Proclin as a
preservative.;
• BUF: HEPES buffer containing Proclin as preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
The assay is based on chemiluminescence technology. 30μL of patient sample, controls or
calibrators are incubated with assay buffer. Following the first incubation step, an anti-cortisol
monoclonal antibody is added, followed by a subsequent incubation step. An acridinium labelled
cortisol conjugate and anti-IgG antibody coated magnetic particles are added prior to a third
incubation step. The magnetic particles are captured using a magnet and a wash step performed
to remove any unbound analyte. Trigger reagents are added; the resulting light emitted by the
acridinium label is inversely proportional to the concentration of analyte in the original sample.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The IDS Cortisol assay precision was evaluated internally in accordance with a modified
protocol based on CLSI EP05-A3, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative
Measurement Methods.” Six samples (two native serum samples and four contrived serum
samples) were included in the precision testing at one site. Each of the six samples were
tested for 20 days, two runs per day in two replicates using three lots of reagents on three
IDS systems, one kit lot per system, with two operators. The IDS Cortisol assay precision
was established using samples with concentrations ranging from approximately 0.80 μg/dL to
45.00 μg/dL.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the IDS Cortisol assay was conducted based on guidance from CLSI EP6-A.
A high human serum sample (~45 μg/dL) and a low human serum sample (0.40 μg/dL)
were prepared respectively by spiking a serum sample with a high concentration cortisol
solution and diluting a serum sample with cortisol-free calibrator matrix. The high and
low serum samples were mixed to create a total of 14 concentration levels. Samples were
assayed in quadruplicate within a single run.
Statistical evaluation using linear regression showed that the assay is linear from 0.59 to
45.00 μg/dL, yielding a linear regression result of y = 1.01x + 0.01 with a correlation
coefficient of R2 = 1.00.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous and Exogenous Drug Interference:
Except for Rheumatoid Factor, interference was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP07-A3
on two contrived serum samples at two different cortisol concentrations (~2 μg/dL to ~30
μg/dL). Interference substances were spiked into the serum samples and the results were
measured and compared between the spiked and un-spiked samples. Each interferent was
tested at two different levels. Both spiked and un-spiked samples were assayed in 26
replicates each. The sponsor defined significant interference as >10% bias between test and
control samples.
To determine potential interference of Rheumatoid Factor, a serum sample with ~5 µg/dL
cortisol and high Rheumatoid Factor concentration was diluted 1:2 and 1:4 in calibrator
matrix and each dilution was assayed in duplicate. The recovery bias compared to the neat
sample for each dilution was < 10%.

The package insert contains the following limitations:
Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins,
interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to
animal serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may
be observed.
Pregnancy, contraceptives and estrogen therapy lead to elevated cortisol
concentrations.”
Cross-reactivity:
Cross-reactivity studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP07- A3.
Contrived serum samples were spiked with 13 potential cross-reactants. The
analyte concentration of the samples was approximately ~2 and ~30 µg/dL of
cortisol. For each serum sample spiked with a cross-reactant, a control (un-spiked
sample) was prepared by replacing the cross-reactant with the same volume of
cross-reactant solvent. Both spiked and un-spiked samples were assayed in 26
replicates each.
The percentage of cross reactivity was determined using the formula below:

The package insert contains the following limitations:
“In samples from patients who have been treated with prednisolone,
methylprednisolone or prednisone may lead to falsely elevated cortisol
concentrations.
Patients suffering from 21-hydroxylase deficiency exhibit elevated 21-
deoxycortisol and this can also lead to elevated cortisol levels.”
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range of the assay is 0.59 – 45.00 µg/dL. Any value that reads below 0.59
µg/dL should be reported as “<0.59 µg/dL”. Any value that reads above 45.00 µg/dL should
be reported as “>45.00 µg/dL.” The results of the detection limit, linearity and method
comparison studies support the assay reportable range.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The IDS Cortisol assay is standardized against the ERM-DA451/IFCC panel, which is
traceable to the LC-MS/MS Candidate Reference Measurement Procedure (cRMP) Total
Serum Cortisol.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
determined with guidance from CLSI EP17-A2, “Protocols for Determination of Limits of
Detection and Limits of Quantitation” using 60 blank replicates and 13 low level samples.
The LoB, LoD and LoQ samples were tested with three kit lots.
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined using zero calibrator matrix. Each LoB sample was
assayed during a five-day period for a total of 60 replicates (12 replicates per assay, one
assay per day, for five days) on one instrument by one operator for each kit lot. A different
instrument was used for each kit lot. LoB was calculated according to the parametric function
as described in CLSI EP17-A2.

The limit of detection (LoD) samples were prepared by diluting two human serum samples
with zero matrix to achieve a panel of samples of six cortisol levels ranging from 0.21 to
0.71μg/dL. Each of the six LoD samples was measured in duplicate. For each kit lot, a total
of ten assays were performed over a five-day period by one operator and on a different
instrument per kit lot, for a total of ten replicates per sample. LoD was calculated according
to CLSI EP17-A2.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) samples were prepared by diluting two human serum samples
with zero matrix to achieve 7 sample levels ranging from 0.21 to 1.21μg/dL. The LoQ panel
of seven samples were measured in duplicate two times per day. For each kit lot, a total of
ten assays were run over a five-day period by one operator and on a different instrument, for
a total of 20 replicates per sample. The limit of quantitation was defined as the lowest analyte
concentration with a within-laboratory precision of ≤ 20% CV.
LoB, LoD and LoQ were calculated according to the parametric analysis described in CLSI
EP17-A2. The results support the following detection limits:
Sensitivity Concentration (μg/dL)
Limit of Blank (LoB) 0.10
Limit of Detection (LoD) 0.24
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) 0.59

only; it is recommended that each laboratory establish its own expected range based upon its
own patient population. The time of sample collection must be considered when interpreting
results due to the cortisol secretion circadian rhythm. Severe stress can also lead to elevated
cortisol levels.”
