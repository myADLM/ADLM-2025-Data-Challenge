III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Bigfoot Unity Diabetes Management System is indicated for the management of diabetes in
persons age 12 years and older.
Bigfoot Unity provides glucose monitoring data via the Abbott FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose
Monitoring sensor. The system incorporates real time alarm capabilities and is designed to
replace blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions, unless otherwise indicated. The
device is intended to provide insulin dose information using the available glucose data to assist
persons with diabetes mellitus who use disposable pen-injectors for the self-injection of insulin
in implementing health care provider recommended insulin dose regimens. The device is
intended for single patient use only and requires a prescription.
Bigfoot Unity is also intended to communicate autonomously with digitally connected medical
devices where the user manually controls therapy decisions.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The System must not be used with automated insulin dosing (AID) systems, including closed
loop and insulin suspend systems.
Taking ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise
Sensor glucose readings. You can take doses of ascorbic acid up to 500 mg per day and make
treatment decisions with the Sensor. Taking more than 500 mg of ascorbic acid per day may
affect the Sensor readings which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event.
The System must be removed prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed
Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The effect of
MRI, CT scans, or diathermy on the performance of the System has not been evaluated. The
exposure may damage the Sensor and may impact proper function of the device which could
cause incorrect readings.
Do not use the System in people less than 12 years of age.
Do not use this system if you are pregnant, on dialysis, or critically ill. The System is not cleared
for use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or medications common to
these populations may affect performance of the System.
Performance of the System has not been evaluated when used with other implaneted medical
devices, such as pacemakers.
K202145 - Page 2 of 22

--- Page 3 ---
The System does not support insulin doses in half-increments. Patients who require half-unit
doses of insulin should not use the System.
The System supports once daily dosing of long-acting insulin. Patients who take more than one
daily dose of long-acting insulin should not use the System.
Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: if you are experiencing
symptoms that are not consistent with the glucose readings, consult your health care
professional.
Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the "check
blood glucose" symbol during the first 12 hours of wearing a Sensor, if your Sensor glucose
reading does not match how you feel, or if the reading does not include a number.
Wash application site on the back of your upper arm using a plain soap, dry, and then clean with
an alcohol wipe. This will hep remove any oily residue that may prevent the sensor from sticking
properly. Allow site to air dry before proceeding. Carefully preparing the site according to these
instructions will help the Sensor stay on your body for the full 14-day wear period and help
prevent it from falling off early.
Store the Sensor Kit between 36°F and 82°F. If you suspect that the temperature may exceeed
82°F (e.g., an un-airconditioned home in the summer), you should refridgerate your Sensor Kit.
Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.
You must scan the Sensor to get your current glucose level as the Bigfoot Unity App will not
provide this information.
Take standard precautions for transmission of blood borne pathogens to avoid contamination.
Use of the Sensor with devices, apps, and software that are not listed by the manufacturer as
compatible with the System may cause inaccuracte glucose readings.
If a Sensor breaks inside your body, call your health care professional.

N/A
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Bigfoot Unity utilizes continuous glucose monitoring to support people with diabetes
mellitus who use disposable insulin pens for self-injection of insulin. The system consists of the
Abbott FreeStyle Libre 2 integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM), two reusable insulin
pen caps (one each for rapid-acting and long-acting insulin pens) and a mobile application. The
components communicate via near field communication (NFC) and Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE).
K202145 - Page 3 of 22

--- Page 4 ---
The Bigfoot Unity contains a digital lookup table that displays insulin dose recommendations on
the Bigfoot Unity pen caps based on healthcare provider (HCP)-prescribed regimens. The
System also provides a set of meal dose recommendations based on meal size, where the meal
doses are set by the HCP and entered in the lookup table.
The device generates glucose data using the FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor and displays the data (value
and trend) on the rapid-acting insulin pen cap (the White Cap) when the user scans the sensor
using the White Cap. The rapid-acting pen cap also displays correction and meal insulin doses
based upon the lookup table and available glucose data. The long-acting pen cap (the Black Cap)
displays the long-acting insulin dose prescribed by the user’s healthcare provider. From the dose
recommendations on the pen caps, as well as other contextually relevant information such as
glucose trend arrows, users manually select an insulin dose and administer it using the pens
according to the insulin manufacturers’ instructions. In addition to displaying dose information,
both pen caps track the time of insulin doses.
The mobile app allows user entry, in consultation with their HCP, of a prescribed insulin dosing
regimen into the digital lookup table, as well as provides system alerts and historical information.
The mobile app has a built-in, mandatory low-glucose alarm at 55 md/dL and an optional low-
glucose alarm at 70 mg/dL. The mobile app receives glucose data from the sensor via BLE and
will alert if the sensor glucose reading is below the threshold(s). However, in order to obtain the
glucose sensor value, the user must scan the sensor with the White Cap. Additionally, the mobile
app manages the secure wireless communication between the system components and enables
the transfer of the system data to the cloud.
B Principle of Operation:
Bigfoot Unity incorporates the FreeStyle Libre 2 continuous glucose sensor and glucose
translation library for calculating glucose values and trend information. Additionally, Bigfoot
Unity uses the FreeStyle Libre 2 wireless communication protocols to (1) obtain glucose values
and trend information on the White Cap, and (2) provide real-time alerts in the mobile app.

For this device, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been shown to interfere with system
performance. Analytical Specificity/Interference was previously assessed in K193371.
Based on the results of the clinical evaluation and bench testing for ascorbic acid, the
following statements have been placed in the device labeling:
• User Manual Warning: Taking ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplements while wearing
the Sensor may falsely raise Sensor glucose readings. You can take doses of ascorbic
acid up to 500 mg per day and make treatment decisions with the Sensor. Taking
more than 500 mg of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which
could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event. Ascorbic acid can be found in
supplements including multivitamins. Some supplements, including cold remedies
such as Airborne® and Emergen-C®, may contain high doses of 1000 mg of ascorbic
acid and should not be taken while using the Sensor. See your healthcare professional
to understand how long ascorbic acid is active in your body.
• Bigfoot Unity Mobile App On-Screen Warning: Do not take high doses of vitamin C
(more than 500 mg per day). This may falsely raise your Sensor readings.
Supplements like Airborne or Emergen-C have high doses of vitamin C. Read
labeling for all supplements to determine vitamin C content.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Assay Reportable Range was previously assessed in K193371. The reportable range for the
Bigfoot Unity is 40 to 400 mg/dL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Shelf-life of the FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor was previously assessed in K193371. The FreeStyle
Libre 2 sensor has a storage shelf-life of 9 months. Shelf-life was evaluated at 36° – 82°
Fahrenheit within the humidity range of 10% - 90%.
6. Detection Limit:
If a glucose measurement is less than 40 mg/dL, the result will be displayed by the system as
‘< 40 mg/dL’. If the glucose measurement exceeds 400 mg/dL, the result will be displayed as
‘>400 mg/dL’.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Two prospective clinical studies were conducted in the United States to support clearance of
the predicate device in K193371. The pediatric study data was reanalyzed to align with the
proposed intended user population of the Bigfoot Unity (12 years and older).
In both studies, accuracy of the FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor was evaluated by comparing iCGM
glucose values to an FDA-cleared laboratory grade comparator method (CM, using the YSI
2300). Glucose values were obtained from the iCGM and from the comparator at the same or
similar time. The accuracy of iCGM glucose versus the comparator method was assessed by
calculating the percentage of iCGM readings that were within 15%, 20%, and 40% for
reference values ≥70 mg/dL, and within 15 mg/dL, 20 mg/dL, and 40 mg/dL for values < 70
mg/dL. For glucose values < 70 mg/dL, the difference in mg/dL between the CGM and
comparator glucose values was calculated. For values ≥70 mg/dL, the relative difference (%)
to the comparator value was calculated.
Data from the two clinical studies are presented in the tables below.

Trend Accuracy
Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose
and is characterized by slopes, such as from > 2mg/dL/min to <-2 mg/dL/min. Trend
accuracy was assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change from the iCGM
and the corresponding comparator values for each iCGM-comparator measurement pair.

Agreement When iCGM Reads ‘<40 mg/dL’ or ‘>400 mg/dL’
The System reports glucose concentrations between 40 and 400 mg/dL. When the System
determines that the glucose level is below 40 mg/dL, it will report as ‘< 40 mg/dL’ on the
White Cap. When the System determines that glucose level is above 400 mg/dL, it will report
as ‘> 400 mg/dL’ on the White Cap.
The cumulative percentages of when the comparator values were less than certain glucose
values (for ‘< 40 mg/dL’) and when comparator values were more than certain glucose
values (for ‘>400 mg/dL’) are presented in the tables below

Alarm Performance
The tables in this section show the accuracy of the System’s Low Glucose Alarm. The Alarm
Rate tells the user how often the alarm is right or wrong. The Detection Rate tells the user
how often the System is able to recognize and notify the user about a low or high glucose
event (within 15 minutes before or after the event).
True Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was below the
alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.
False Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was not below the
alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.
Detection Rate: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the alarm
issued within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.
Missed Detection Rate: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the
alarm didn’t issue within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.

Sensor Stability
Sensor stability describes the performance of the sensor over the sensor lifetime. Sensors can
be worn for up to 14 days. Performance was estimated by calculating the mean of the
absolute relative differences between iCGM and comparator measurement and percentage of
device readings within 15 mg/dL or 15% (15/15%), 20 mg/dL or 20% (20/20%) and 40
mg/dL or 40% (40/40%) of the comparator values during the beginning, early middle, late
middle, and end of the wear period. These times were defined as follows:
• Beginning (Adult Days 1-3, Pediatric: Days 1-2)
• Early Middle (Adult: Days 7-8, Pediatric: Days 7-8),
• Late Middle (Adult: Days 9-12, Pediatric: Days 9-12), and
• End (Adult: Days 13-14, Pediatric: Days 13-14).
The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and agreement rates with the comparator
method were evaluated over 14-day life of the sensor.

Sensor Life
The Sensor can be worn for up to 14 days. To estimate how long a Sensor will work over the
wear duration, 146 Sensors were evaluated in the Adult study and 87 Sensors were evaluated
in the Pediatric study to determine how many days of readings each Sensor provided.
Subjects did not wash the insertion site with soap and water before applying the Sensors and
wore two Sensors simultaneously. Of the 146 Sensors in the Adult study, 71.1% lasted until
the final day of use. 6 Sensors (4.1%) had “early sensor shut-off” where the Sensor algorithm
detected that the Sensors did not function as intended and presented the user with a Replace
Sensor message. In the Pediatric study, 80.3% of the Sensors lasted until the final day of use.
2 Sensors (2.3%) had “early sensor shut-off” where the Sensor algorithm detected that the
Sensors did not function as intended and presented the user with a Replace Sensor message.

* Performance tables provided are based on the paired data against the comparator reference
from 86 subjects. For one of the subjects, the sensor did not survive through their in-clinic
session, resulting in no pair sensor-comparator method reference. However, that subject’s
sensor is included in calculating the sensor survival, resulting in 87 sensors.
A third clinical study was also conducted to further evaluate wear duration in subjects who
first washed the insertion site with a plain soap and water, according to the full instructions in
the labeling and wore only a single Sensor. Of the 39 Sensors evaluated in this study, 97%
lasted until the final day of use.
Glucose Reading Availability
The System is designed to show a Sensor glucose reading after each scan that is performed
throughout the wear period after the start-up time. As such, the capture rate characterizes the
reliability of the communication between components of the system.

Biocompatibility
Biocompatibility testing in accordance with ISO10993-1 and FDA Guidance “Use of
International Standard ISO 10993-1, Biological evaluation of medical devices Part 1:
Evaluation and testing within a risk management process (June 16, 2016)” was performed on
the Black Cap and the White Cap of the Bigfoot Unity. Biological evaluation included
cytotoxicity, irritation, and sensitization testing. All biocompatibility testing met the acceptance
criteria.
Sterilization
The only sterile component of the Bigfoot Unity is the FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor. The sterility of
the sensor was established in K193371.
Pen Cap Cleaning
The pen caps are intended to be used over a 2-year period by a single patient and cleaned as
needed using water or isopropyl alcohol wipes to clean the outside or a six-inch-long cotton
swab to clean the inner cavity of the cap. The cleaning regimen provided in the use guide is
intended to maintain the pen cap’s functionality but is not intended to be a validated disinfection
process.
