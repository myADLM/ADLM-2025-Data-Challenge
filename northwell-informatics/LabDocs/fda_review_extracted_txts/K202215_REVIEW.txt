A Device Description:
cobas BKV is a quantitative test performed on the cobas 6800 System and cobas 8800 System.
cobas BKV enables the detection of BKV DNA in plasma specimens. The cobas BKV assay is a
dual target assay, with both targets using the same dye. The DNA Internal Control, used to
monitor the entire sample preparation and PCR amplification process, is introduced into each
specimen during sample processing. cobas BKV enables the detection and quantitation of BKV
DNA in EDTA plasma transplant patients.
cobas BKV is intended for use as an aid in the management of BKV in transplant patients. In
patients undergoing monitoring of BKV, serial DNA measurements can be used to indicate the
need for potential treatment changes and to assess viral response to treatment.
The cobas BKV Kit system consists of:
• Proteinase Solution
K202215 - Page 2 of 27

--- Page 3 ---
• DNA Quantitation Standard (DNA QS)
• Elution Buffer
• Master Mix Reagent 1
• BKV Master Mix Reagent 2
The BKV viral load is quantified against a non-BKV DNA quantitation standard (DNA-QS),
which is introduced into each specimen during sample preparation. The DNA-QS also functions
as an internal control for sample preparation and the PCR amplification process.
In addition, the test utilizes the following separately packed and sold control materials:
1. cobas EBV/BKV Positive Control Kit :
• EBV/BKV Low Positive Control (EBV/BKV L(+)C)
• EBV/BKV High Positive Control (EBV/BKV H+)C)
The positive control contains phage packaged EBVBKV and BKV DNA in normal human
plasma and serves as a control for the cobas BKV test.
2. cobas Negative Control Kit:
• cobas Buffer Negative Control (BUF (-) C)
Testing with the cobas BKV test requires the following materials that are not provided:
• cobas OMNI Reagents
• cobas BKV Assay Specific Analysis Package (ASAP) software
The cobas BKV test uses sample preparation (nucleic acid extraction and purification) followed
by PCR amplification and detection, all steps are fully automated by the cobas 6800/8800
platform.
B Principle of Operation:
The cobas BKV test is a quantitative PCR test performed on the fully automated cobas 6800/
8800 Systems that detects and quantifies BKV DNA from (EDTA) plasma specimens of
transplant patients as follows.
Target Selection
Selective amplification of BKV target nucleic acid from the sample is achieved using specific
forward and reverse primers which are selected to amplify highly-conserved regions of the BKV
DNA VP-2 and T-antigen gene. Specific probes for each amplicon are used to detect and
quantify the BKV targets from subtypes I, II, III and IV as well as subgroups Ia, Ib, Ic, IVa, IVb,
and IVc. Selective amplification of DNA-QS is achieved using DNA-QS specific forward and
reverse primers, selected to have no homology with the BKV genome, detected through a DNA-
QS specific probe.
Sample Preparation (Nucleic Acid Extraction and Purification)
Nucleic acid from patient samples and external controls are extracted upon addition of a DNA
Quantitation standard (DNA-QS). The DNA-QS molecules are extracted simultaneously with the
samples/controls serving as an extraction control. Viral nucleic acid is released by addition of
proteinase and lysis reagent to the sample. The released nucleic acid, along with the added DNA-
QS binds to magnetic glass particles. Unbound substances and impurities are removed with
K202215 - Page 3 of 27

--- Page 4 ---
subsequent wash reagent steps and purified nucleic acid is then eluted from the magnetic glass
particles with elution buffer.
Nucleic Acid Amplification and Target Detection
The cobas BKV master mix contains detection probes which are specific for the two BKV target
sequences and the DNA-QS nucleic acid, respectively. The two BKV specific detection probes
are labeled with the same HEX fluorescent dye while the DNA-QS detection probe is labeled
with the CY5.5 fluorescent dye both acting as reporter dyes. Each probe also has a second dye,
BHQ, which acts as a quencher that suppresses the fluorescent signals of the intact probes when
they are not bound to their respective target sequence. Target bound probes, however, emit
fluorescence of the two reporter dyes. This fluorescence is measured at defined wavelengths,
thus permitting simultaneous detection and discrimination of the BKV targets and the DNA-QS
amplification products generated by a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme.
BKV DNA Quantitation
During the extension phase of the PCR process, fluorescence readings are processed to generate
Ct values for the BKV DNA target and the BKV QS DNA. The lot-specific calibration constants
provided with the cobas BKV test are used to calculate the titer value for the specimens and
controls based on both the BKV DNA target and the BKV QS DNA Ct values. BKV viral load
results are reported in International Units/mL (IU/mL).
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
cobas 6800/8800
2. Specimen Identification:
The specimen identification information is captured and stored as a digital record. Whole
blood collected in appropriate tubes as per instructions for use are prepared for the test
procedure as described in detail in the cobas® 6800/8800 Systems – User Assistance and/or
User Guide.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Managed by a trained technician.
4. Calibration:
The lot-specific calibration constants are provided with the cobas BKV test. The cobas
6800/8800 Systems automatically determine the BKV DNA concentration for the samples
and controls. The BKV DNA concentration is expressed in International Units per milliliter
(IU/mL).
5. Quality Control:
One negative control [(–) C] and two positive controls, a low positive control [EBV/BKV
L(+)C] and a high positive control [EBV/BKV H(+)C] is processed with each batch. The
K202215 - Page 4 of 27

--- Page 5 ---
batch is valid if no flags appear for all three controls. The negative control result is displayed
as (–) C and the low and high positive controls are displayed as EBV/BKV L(+)C and
EBV/BKV H(+)C. Invalidation of results is performed automatically by the cobas®
6800/8800 software based on negative and positive control failures.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
Precision:
Precision was assessed for the predominant BKV Subgroup 1b by serially diluting BKV 1b
lambda stock in BKV negative EDTA-Plasma to generate a 7-member panel ranging from 60
IU/mL to 1x106 IU/mL.
Precision was calculated on results generated with 21 replicates per run, 2 runs per day using 3
kit lots, 4 cobas 6800 systems and two operators. This testing design accounts for a total of 72
replicates per panel member (PM).
Results were analyzed according to CLSI guideline EP5-A. For data analysis only samples with
tiers within the linear range of the assay were used (i.e., between 21.5 IU/mL and 1x 108 IU/mL).
For the PM1, the assigned concentration was 9.83 x 107 IU/mL with 63/71 replicates above the
Upper Limit of Quantification and the data were excluded from the analysis. The results for
cobas BKV precision calculated for 6 dilution levels are shown in Table 1.

Reproducibility Study:
Reproducibility of cobas BKV was evaluated in EDTA plasma across three Reagent Lots, three
Test Sites, three Instruments (two cobas 6800 Systems and one cobas 8800 System). Two runs
were performed per operator per day (1 run = 1 batch; 1 batch = 1 panel + 3 controls) over five
days per reagent lot and each run had three replicates per panel member. The total number of
tests (not including controls) was as follows: 3 lots × 3 sites × 5 days/lot × 2 runs × 3
replicates/concentration = 270 test results/concentration.
Test panel members were prepared from BKV VCA IgG sero-negative and DNA negative
EDTA plasma spiked with either the BKV WHO Standard or BKV genotype 1b genomic
material in the form of BKV cell culture supernatant. Test panel members had the following
concentrations: Negative, 64.5 IU/mL (3x LLoQ), 5x103 IU/mL, 5x104 IU/mL, 5x105 IU/mL,
and 5x107 IU/mL (0.5x ULoQ). Across the three testing sites, positive panel members produced
1350 results of which 1 was invalid (operator error) and excluded from analysis. For negative
panel members all 270 test results were valid. The results are summarized in Table 3 below.

Analysis of variance and a mixed model that included lot, site, day/operator, batch and within-
batch (random error) as random effects was performed. The variance contribution of each
component to the total variance was estimated. The range of the total lognormal coefficient of
variation, among positive panel members, was from 15.74% to 79.43%. The largest total
lognormal coefficient of variation was observed in the lowest positive panel member (3x LLoQ).
Most of that variability (78% of the total variance) was explained by the within-batch component
attributed to one clinical testing site.
Linearity:
A linearity panel composed of 11 panel members, prepared by diluting BKV subgroup 1b (GT
1b) lambda DNA (phagemid) and 7 panel members prepared by diluting a subgroup 1b clinical
specimen, were tested at each concentration level (Table 4). The highest assigned titer for the
phagemid panel member was 1.97E+08 IU/mL and the highest assigned titer for the clinical
panel member was 6.72E+04 IU/mL. The phagemid and clinical panel members overlapped in
the intermediate and low part of the measuring range (from a nominal titer of 1.00E+05 IU/mL
to 1.50E+01 IU/mL).

Testing was performed using three cobas 8800 instruments by three operators on 12 replicates
for each concentration using three test-specific kit lots (a total of 36 replicates per concentration).
Twelve run were performed of which nine runs containing a total of 648 valid results were
analyzed. Three runs were manually excluded due to operator error (error during sample
preparation). Results were analyzed according to CLSI guideline EP6-A. The acceptance criteria
for the maximal deviation between the linear regression and the better fitting higher order
regression model was set as equal to or less than ± 0.3 log IU/mL.
10
The parameter estimates of b0, b1, b2, and b3 are shown for 1st order linear and 3rd order
polynomial fits (Table 5). For all the test kits and sample types combined, both the higher order
coefficients (b2 and b3) were significant at 5% level. The 3rd order fit was chosen as the best
fitting regression model as it had the smaller Root Mean Square Error (Figure 1). The maximal
difference between the linear and 3rd order fits was observed for the lowest clinical panel
member with a nominal titer of 1.50E+01 IU/mL (below the LLoQ of the assay).

Figure 1: Linearity Across Both Panel Types and All Kit Lots Combined
The linear range of cobas BKV, defined as the concentration range for which the deviation of
predicted log titer of the better fitting regression (2nd or 3rd order) and the predicted log titer
10 10
of the linear regression (1st order) is within ± 0.3 log was determined as:
10
Observed linear range: 1.01E+01 to 1.97E+08 IU/mL
Claimed linear range: 21.5 IU/mL to 1.0E+08 IU/mL
Verification of Linearity of cobas BKV with other genotypes:
Linearity was assessed for five BKV subgroup/subtype panels, one for each genotype, spanning
the linear range from the ULoQ of 1.00E+08 IU/mL to LLoQ of 2.00E+01 IU/mL.
Intermediate Stock Solutions (ISS) for each genotype were verified using either the QIAGEN
artus BK virus QS-RGQ PCR kit (subgroup Ia and phagemids of subtypes II, III and IV) or by
digital droplet PCR (subgroup Ic).
Ten-fold serial dilutions from 1.00E+08 IU/mL to 2.00E+01 IU/mL (nominal titer), of cell
culture supernatant of BKV subgroup Ia, phagemids of BKV subgroup Ic, and subtypes II, III,
and IV were prepared in BKV-negative EDTA-plasma. Four replicates were tested per
concentration level. Subgroup Ia was tested using 3 kit lots and 2 cobas 6800/8800 Systems.
Subgroup Ic, and subtypes II, III and IV, were tested using three kit lots and one cobas
6800/8800 System. Twelve runs were performed of which all 12 were valid resulting in 480 data
points.
Linear (1st order) and nonlinear, 2nd order and 3rd order, regression fits were performed for all
genotypes tested for all lots combined. The Root Mean Square Error (MSE) of the 3rd order was
smallest and was chosen as the best fitting regression model to calculate the absolute difference
between the predicted log titer obtained from the 1st and 3rd order regression fits. Both higher
order coefficients (b2 and b3) were significant at 5% level.
BKV subgroups Ia, Ic, and subtypes II, III, and IV were detectable within the linear range of
1.00E+08 IU/mL to 2.00E=01 IU/mL that was established for the predominant subgroup Ib

(Table 6). For all genotypes tested, the absolute deviation was ≤0.21 log IU/mL at all
10
concentration levels.

* Maximum difference between linear regression and the better fitting higher order model
Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLoQ):
The analysis for Lower Limit of Quantitation was performed with data obtained from the LOD
study using the WHO standard. The LLoQ is the lowest titer within the linear range with a hit
rate of at least 95% which meets the acceptance criterion for the Total Analytical Error (TAE)
and the “Difference between Measurements in SD” approach. The acceptance criteria for TAE is
1. The TAE, when calculated as |Bias| + 2SD, is ≤1.0 log IU/mL, and
10
2. The TAE has to be such that the standard deviation for the difference between two
measurements calculated as SQRT(2) x 2 x SD is ≤ 1.0 log IU/mL
10
Table 7 shows the LLoQ calculated for each kit lot and combined across all the kit lots to be 19
IU/mL. However, as the LLoQ of the assay cannot be below the claimed LoD, the LLoQ was set
at 21.5 IU/mL (LLoQ = LoD).

1. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross reactivity:
For potential cross reactants 35 microorganisms, including 17 viral isolates, 15 bacterial
strains and three fungal isolates were used and divided into 7 pools with 4 to 5
microorganisms per cross reactant pool and, HCV as single interferent. Interferent pools not
meeting the acceptance criteria of the mean difference in log Titer (Interferent – Control) of
10
± 0.5 log were resolved into individual components and retested. Potential cross reactants in
10
BKV negative EDTA plasma were tested in the absence and presence of BKV DNA at a
concentration of 100 IU/mL (approximately 5x LLoQ). Potential cross reactants were tested
at 1x106 copies/mL, IU/mL, TCID50/mL, cells/mL, CFU/mL, IFU/mL or CCU/mL for each
organism except for HPV which was tested at 1x105. HCV was tested individually (i.e., not
pooled with other organisms) at 3x105 U/mL. Testing was performed using 6 replicates per
cross reactive pool or individual interferents HCV, 12 replicates of the BKV positive and
negative controls using three kit lots and one cobas 8800 system.
For BKV negative samples the negativity rate was determined. For BKV positive samples the
positivity rate was determined together with the correct quantitation of BKV DNA by
computing the Mean concentration detected across the replicates, the SD and the difference
between the control condition (no cross reactant) and the test condition containing the
potential cross reactant organism. Results are shown in Table 8 below for testing of
interferents.

The mean log titer of the positive BKV samples containing potentially cross-reacting
10
organisms were within ± 0.5 log of the mean log titer of the respective positive spike
10 10
control.
Endogenous Interference:
The effect of potentially interfering endogenous substances on the sensitivity/quantitation of
cobas BKV was determined by testing 20 individual clinical BKV-seronegative samples
spiked with selected endogenous substances and tested in the presence of BKV DNA at a
concentration of 100 IU/mL (approximately 5x LLoQ). The negative sample spiked solely
with BKV target was used as a Positive Spike Control (PSC). To analyze specificity, the
same 20 individual clinical negative samples were individually spiked with potentially
interfering endogenous substances and tested in the absence of BKV target DNA. The un-
spiked samples were used as Negative Spiked Controls (NSC). Interferent concentrations
were used as recommended by the CLSI guideline EP7-A2. Human DNA levels were tested
at 2mg/mL. Control conditions were tested with one replicate per specimen, and test
conditions were tested with 3 replicates per specimen. Results are summarized in Table 9.

Exogenous Interference
The effect of potentially interfering exogenous substances on the sensitivity/quantitation of
cobas BKV was determined by testing 10 individual BKV-negative donor samples spiked
with pools of 24 commercially available drugs at three times the plasma peak level per CLSI
EP7-A2. The same samples were also tested in the presence of BKV target at 100 IU/mL
(approximately 5x LLoQ). The negative sample spiked solely with BKV target was used as a
Positive Spike Control (PSC). The un-spiked samples were used as Negative Spiked Controls
(NSC). Conditions were tested with 3 replicates per specimen. The following drugs were
tested, and the results are summarized in Table 10 below.
• Pool 1: Azathioprine, Sulfamethoxzole, Trimethoprim, Cefotan, Cidofovir
• Pool 2: Foscarnet, Piperacillin, Tazobactam, Prednisone, Vancomycin

2. Assay Reportable Range:
Based on the linearity study and the LoD study, the reportable range claimed by the sponsor
for the cobas BKV assay is 21.5 IU/mL to 1.00E+08 IU/mL.
3. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The cobas BKV assay is standardized against the 1st WHO International Standard for BK
Virus DNA (NIBSC 14/212, predominantly genotype Ia) was used for developing the cobas
BKV assay. The titer of the RMS BKV secondary standard, was established by diluting BKV
cell culture supernatant (genotype 1a) in pooled BKV negative EDTA human plasma. The
titer of the RMS BKV secondary standard was determined to be 4.27 log10 IU/mL using the
calibrator bracketing method.
Traceability of the calibration panel and RMS BKV secondary standard to the WHO standard
was verified as shown in Figure 2. Bivariate fit of observed BKV DNA concentration vs

expected BKV DNA concentration was performed using testing data of 3 dilutions of the 1st
WHO International Standard (panel members (PMs) ranging from 1.28-4.30 log IU/mL),
10
the RMS BKV Secondary Standard (1PM; 4.27 log IU/mL) and the RMS BKV Calibration
10
Panel (6 PMs; ranging from 3.00-8.70 log IU/mL).

Figure 2: Traceability of the calibration panel and RMS BKV secondary standard to
the WHO standard
Quantitation values for the panel members are similar to the expected values with deviation
of ≤ 0.19 log IU/mL. Maximum deviation was observed at 19.0 IU/mL (1.28 log IU/mL)
10 10
close to the assay LLoQ value of 21.5 IU/mL.
The following linear equations were obtained:
BKV Calibration Panel: y = 1.001x -0.011; R2 = 0.999
BKV WHO Standard: y = 0.951 x + 0.208; R2 = 0.973
Based on these results, the calibration and standardization process of cobas BKV provides
quantitation values for the cobas BKV calibration panel and the RMS BKV Secondary
Standard provide traceability to the 1st WHO international Standard for BKV.
Stability:
The clinical specimen stability of BKV viral target in whole blood specimens collected in
EDTA-plasma preparation tubes and/or plasma samples after various storage conditions with
or without freeze-thawing cycles was evaluated using cobas BKV for use on the cobas
6800/8800 Systems.
Freshly drawn whole blood from 12 unique individual BKV-negative donors collected in
EDTA-plasma tubes (6 donor samples collected in PPT and 6 in lavender top tubes) were
spiked with BKV to a concentration of 100 IU/mL (approximately 5x LLoQ). The reference
time point (T0) was processed directly after spiking of the target by separating the blood into
EDTA-plasma; all other samples were stored at indicated conditions until further processing.
K202215 - Page 18 of 27

--- Page 19 ---
All samples used for this study in each PPT/lavender top tube type were tested unspiked at
time point 0 (T0).
All BKV-positive samples tested generated positive results for BKV and the mean log titers
10
including the two-sided 95 confidence interval of each of the tested time points/conditions
and tube types was within ±0.5 log of the mean log titer of the respective reference
10 10
condition (T0 = reference).
The results support the following storage conditions for whole blood collected in BD
Vacutainer PPT or BD Vacutainer EDTA tubes (lavender top) and the respective separated
plasma:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA-plasma tubes (lavender top and PPT) may be stored or
transported for up to 24 hours at 2°C to 25°C before further processing and plasma
separation.
• Afterwards, whole blood samples should be centrifuged, and the resulting plasma
samples are additionally stable for:
o 24 hours at 2°C to 30°C in primary or secondary tubes, followed by
o up to 6 days at 2°C to 8°C in primary or secondary tubes, or
o up to 6 months at -15°C to -80°C in secondary tubes.
• Plasma samples are stable in secondary tubes for up to four freeze/thaw cycles when
frozen between -15°C to -80°C.
Open kit and On-board Stability:
On-Board Stability and Open Kit Stability of the test-specific cassette was evaluated by
testing five time points over the course of 91 days using one kit lot and four 6800/8800
Systems. In order to support the On-Board and Open Kit Stability, as well as the 40 times
usage, the 192T cassette was incubated for a total of 41 hours at 37°C.
The data from this study supports the claim that, once opened, the cobas® BKV 192T test-
specific reagent cassettes are stable for up to 90 days at 2– 8°C (Open Kit Stability) and
remain stable for up to 40 hours at 37°C (On-Board Stability). Furthermore, 192T test-
specific reagent cassettes can be used up to 40 times.
Reagent Stability
Three lots of the cobas BKV were tested to demonstrate stability of the test-specific reagents
of cobas BKV and cobas EBV/BKV Control Kit when stored at stressed temperature
conditions (accelerated stability) and at the targeted storage temperature of 2°C to 8°C (real-
time stability).
Accelerated Stability: The kit components BKV MMX-R2 192T, EBV/BKV H(+)C, and the
EBV/BKV L(+)C were stored at 37°C ± 2°C for up to 75 days and tested at various time
points. All lots met the acceptance criteria at all testing time points (26d, 41d, 51d, 63d, and
75d). The 75 days accelerated stability results predict a 19-month real-time stability for the
test-specific reagents of cobas BKV and cobas EBV/BKV Control Kit.
K202215 - Page 19 of 27

--- Page 20 ---
Real-time stability: The kit components BKV MMX-R2 192T, EBV/BKV H(+)C, and the
EBV/BKV L(+)C were stored at 2-8°C for up to 13 months and tested at various time points.
All lots met the acceptance criteria at all testing time points (3m, 6m, 9m, 12m and 13m).
Shelf-life: Based on the combined data of accelerated and real-time stability studies the
results support a shelf-life of 12 months when stored at 2-8°C.
Expected values for Quality Controls:
To monitor the assay performance, reagent performance, and procedural errors, positive and
negative external controls must be run in accordance with the guidelines or requirements of
local, state, and/or federal regulations or accrediting organizations.
External Controls are provided separately from the cobas BKV test kit in the cobas
EBV/Positive Control Kit and the cobas Buffer Negative Control Kit. The cobas EBV/BKV
positive control consists of BKV phagemid DNA diluted into BKV negative human plasma
at two concentrations to yield the EBV/BKV Low Positive Control (EBV/BKV L(+)C) and
the EBV/BKV High Positive Control (EBV/BKV H(+)C). The cobas Buffer negative control
consists of Tris buffer with <0.002% Poly rA RNA. The cobas BKV Negative Control, the
BKV Low Positive Control, and the BKV High Positive Control must be included in each
run. The validity of the results for the controls as well as for the DNA-QS (internal control) is
determined by the assay specific analysis software package used by the cobas 6800/8800
instrument. The amount of BKV DNA for BKV high and low positive controls must fall
within their acceptable titer ranges.
The failure rates of the kit controls and samples were assessed by evaluating outcomes of the
nine analytical studies (LoD, LoD verification for Genotype, Linearity, Linearity verification
for Genotype, Precision, Cross contamination, Lot interchangeability, Accuracy, and LoD in
Plasma vs Buffer). Results demonstrated an overall invalid rate of 0.01% for QS, 0% for
RMC and a 0.20% sample failure rate.
4. Detection Limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD) using the 1st WHO International Standard for BKV
The LoD of the cobas BKV test for the 1st WHO BKV Standard (BKV Subgroup 1b) was
determined by analysis of serial dilutions of the Standard diluted into a pooled EDTA-plasma
derived from BKV negative individuals. Panels of six concentration levels plus a blank were
tested with three lots of cobas BKV test reagents and four instruments with multiple runs and
operators over a period of 3 days. Each dilution was determined in 63 replicates per lot and
day (n=189 total replicates per day).
The results from testing the WHO BKV Standard in EDTA plasma as well as the calculated
LoD values are shown in the table below. The LoD and LLoQ values were determined by
Probit analysis and by 95% hit rate (Table 11).

When determined by Probit analysis, the different lots have similar LoD for all tested lots,
the highest LoD of 21.5 IU/mL was obtained with lot 1, which is only slightly higher than
the LoD determined by 95% hit rate. The LoD by 95% hit rate was 19.0 IU/mL (181/189)
and was identical for all tested lots.
The claimed LoD value is 21.5 IU/mL and this concentration was used in studies for
confirmation of the LoD.
Verification of the Limit of Detection (LoD) with genotypes of subgroup Ia, Ic, and
subtypes II, II, and IV.
The Limit of Detection (21.5 IU/mL) was verified for the cobas BKV test with BKV
subgroup Ia, Ic, and subtypes II, III, and IV following the CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. For
subgroups Ia, subtypes II and IV clinical specimens were used. Due to lack of clinical
specimens phagemids for subgroup Ic and subtype II were used.
BKV positive material was diluted in BKV- PCR negative pooled EDTA plasma to
prepare the ISS. The ISS titer was confirmed by QIAGEN artus BK Virus QS-RGQ PCR

Kit with three replicates. For subgroup Ic, digital droplet PCR was used to confirm initial
titer as primers in the QIAGEN kit were not able to detect this subgroup. Each panel
consisted of 4 concentration levels around the LoD (1.5x (32.25 IU/mL), 1.0x (21.5
IU/mL), 0.5x (10.8 IU/mL)) and 0.25x (5.4 IU/mL) LoD). Initial testing was performed
with a panel of 1.5x, 1.0x and 0.5x LoD panel members. For those sample with <95% hit
rate at 0.5x LoD an additional panel member of 0.025x LoD was tested. At 1.5x LoD
(32.25 IU/mL) at genotypes showed a 100% positivity rate.
A total of 63 replicates per concentration level were tested across 3 dilution series, 3
instruments and 3 kit lots. A different operator tested each dilution series.
The results are shown in Table 12 and verify that a hit rate of 95% or higher was
observed at 21.5 IU/mL (1x LoD) for BKV genotypes. Thus, the observed hit rates verify
the LoD for BKV at 21.5 IU/mL.

Limit of Detection (LoD) in Plasma vs Buffer
This study evaluated whether the Limit of Detection in Generic Specimen Diluent (GSD) is
equivalent to the LoD in EDTA-plasma (21.5 IU/mL) in the cobas BKV assay, so that GSD
can be used as a negative control for cobas BKV. Three independent dilution series (0.5x,
1.0x, and 1.5x LoD of cobas BKV) were prepared on three consecutive days using the 1st
WHO BKV International Standard in GSD. Each dilution series was tested using one test-
specific reagent kit lot. Three out of three runs performed were valid yielding 189 test results.
The results (Table 13) demonstrated a comparable LoD performance of cobas BKV in
Plasma and GSD.

7. Carry-Over:
The carry-over rate for cobas BKV was determined by testing 240 replicates of an BKV-
negative matrix sample and 225 replicates of a high titer BKV sample at 2.00E+07 IU/mL
(approximately 106x LLoQ). The high titer sample was prepared by spiking a high-positive
BKV cell culture supernatant (ATCC BKV VR-837) into negative pooled EDTA-plasma and
titer verified by using QIAGEN artus BK Virus QS-RGQ PCR Kit.
In total, five runs were performed with positive and negative samples in a checkerboard
configuration using one kit lot and one cobas 8800 system.
All 240 replicates of the negative sample were negative, resulting in a carry-over rate of 0%
(upper one-sided 95% confidence interval: 1.24%).
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The comparator BKV assay is well validated, currently used in clinical practice at a major
transplant center in the United States and is traceable to the BKV WHO standard. The use of
this comparator is acceptable. Please see “Other Clinical Supportive Data” section below.

Concordance of cobas BKV with a Comparator BKV LDM
The clinical performance of the cobas BKV assay was compared with a validated, well-
established laboratory developed nucleic acid method (LDM) (comparator BKV LDM) by
measuring BKV DNA levels in longitudinal clinical samples (neat and diluted) of BKV-
infected and non-infected patients. Contrived EDTA plasma samples spiked with cultured
BKV virus were used to cover the linear range.
The comparator BKV LDM is well validated, currently used in clinical practice at a major
transplant center in the United States and is traceable to the WHO standard. The use of this
comparator is acceptable. The comparator BKV LDM amplifies VP2 gene sequences only
whereas the cobas BKV assay amplifies sequences in both the VP2 and the small t-antigen.
Due to different methods of measuring BKV viral load at each institution, BKV viral load
quantitation may vary between laboratories. Therefore, viral load obtained from different
laboratories on longitudinal samples from the same patient should not be compared. Clinical
management decisions should be based on assessment of the patients BKV load with the
same viral load test.
A total of 550 samples (217 neat and 303 diluted clinical samples from 129 transplant
subjects and 30 contrived samples using cultured BKV genotype 1b) were valid on both
assays and evaluable for the clinical concordance analysis. Results presented in Table 14
demonstrate a column percent agreement between the cobas BKV and BKV LDM ranging
from between 94.1% to 100% depending on the analyte concentration in the samples. The
LLoQ for BKV LDM was 200 IU/ml (2.3 log IU/ml). The analytical ranges BKV DNA
10
were calculated based on standard deviation (σ = 0.37 log IU/ml) of the comparator BKV
10
LDM (Table 14). Analyte concentration of 3.0 log IU/mL represented LLoQ + 2σ, 3.7
10
log IU/mL represented LLoQ + 4σ and 4.4 log IU/mL represented LLoQ + 6σ with a
10 10
range interval of 2σ. Although, concordance between cobas BKV and BKV LDM of 94.1%,
for the range of 2.3 to < 3.0 log IU/mL was below 95%, the 95% confidence interval ranged
10
from 87.0% to 97.5% and was found to be acceptable.

Discordant results were defined as those that are more than one box away from the diagonal
(indicated by shaded cells in Table 14). For Target Not Detected (TND) by LDM Column
Agreement the cobas BKV Target Not Detected and < LLoQ (< 2.3) cells were combined.
The rationale for adding the adjacent <LLoQ and TND cells for the TND column is that the
difference between a TND and <LLoQ is not clinically meaningful and that these are
analytically at the lower end of the measuring range, which may be impacted by random
error.
All 43 BKV DNA negative samples tested using the cobas BKV and the BKV LDM were
negative on both assays. The Negative Percent AgrTeaembleen 1t 5was 100% (95% Exact CI:
91.8% – 100%). Concordance between cobas BKV and the comparator BKV LDM was
also evaluated using different clinical thresholds ( ).

From all samples with valid paired results within the overlapping linear range of both the
cobas BKV and the BKV LDM assay (200 IU/mL to 20 x 106 IU/mL), a total of 313 samples
(133 neat and 159 diluted samples from 68 transplant subjects and 21 contrived samples)
from the three testing sites were evaluated by correlation analysis.
The 95% CI of the y-intercept for the Deming linear regression analysis did not include 0,
indicating that the results of the cobas BKV and the BKV LDM differ by a constant number
(Figure 3). This difference could be caused by differences in calibration methods (e.g., type
of quantitative calibrator, frequency of calibration) between the two tests. The 95% CIs of the
slope included 1, indicating there is no statistical evidence of proportional difference between
the two assays for all samples. The overall correlation coefficient was 0.96, indicating a
strong correlation between cobas BKV and the comparator BKV LDM.
Bias plot analysis of DNA level differences indicated a systematic difference between both
assays that is constant across the overlapping linear range. The 95% CI of the intercept of the
fitted line in the bias plots was (40.4% to 16.8%), which is within ±0.74 log IU/mL (± 2
10
times analytical precision standard deviation of comparator BKV LDM). Furthermore, the
mean bias was estimated at 0.357 log IU/mL and the systematic difference between both
10
assays was 0.343 log IU/mL and 0.362 log IU/mL for samples with DNA levels at 3 and
10 10
