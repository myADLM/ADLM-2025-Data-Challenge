III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
MicroScan Dried Gram Negative MIC/Combo Panels are designed for use in determining
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of
rapidly growing aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine quantitative
and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of rapidly
growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. After inoculation, panels are
incubated for 16 – 20 hours at 35°C +/- 1°C in a non-CO2 incubator, and read either visually or
with MicroScan instrumentation, according to the Package Insert.
This particular submission is for updated susceptibility test interpretative criteria for
Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. for the antimicrobial
ceftazidime (Caz) at concentrations of 0.5 to 64 µg/mL to the test panel.
Ceftazidime has been shown to be active in vitro against most strains of microorganisms listed
below, as described in the FDA-approved package insert for this antimicrobial agent.
Active in vitro and in clinical infections against:
Citrobacter species
Enterobacter species
Escherichia coli
Klebsiella species
Proteus mirabilis
Proteus vulgaris
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Serratia species
Active in vitro but clinical significance is unknown:
Acinetobacter species
Citrobacter koseri (formerly Citrobacter diversus)
Citrobacter freundii
Salmonella species
Shigella species
Yersinia enterocolitica
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
• Rx - For Prescription Use Only
• Results obtained with the organism/antimicrobial agent combinations listed below have
shown discrepant MIC’s when compared with an overnight reference method. If the
antimicrobial agent is critical to patient care, an alternate procedure should be used.
Ceftazidime: Burkholderia cepacia complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Providencia
spp. and Morganella morganii
K202343 - Page 2 of 17

--- Page 3 ---
• The ability of the MicroScan Dried Gram Negative Panels to detect resistance to ceftazidime
is unknown for the following species because an insufficient number of resistant strains were
available at the time of comparative testing: P. vulgaris, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp. and Y.
enterocolitica. Isolates yielding MIC results suggestive of a resistant interpretive category
should be submitted to a reference laboratory.
• Results obtained with Enterobacter spp. and ceftazidime for all read methods with the
Prompt inoculation system and manual reads with turbidity inoculation were within
categorical agreement, but outside of essential agreement when compared to the reference
method. If critical to patient care, Enterobacter spp. isolates should be retested using an
alternate method.
• Results obtained with Proteus vulgaris and ceftazidime for the WalkAway and Manual read
methods with both the Prompt and turbidity inoculation methods were within categorical
agreement, but outside of essential agreement when compared to the reference method. If
critical to patient care, Proteus vulgaris isolates should be retested using an alternate method.
• Performance of ceftazidime when testing Serratia species using the Prompt inoculation
method with the WalkAway, autoSCAN-4 or manual read methods were outside of essential
agreement and categorical agreement compared to the reference method. Serratia species
should only be tested using the turbidity inoculation method.
• Due to the occurrence of very major errors with Klebsiella spp. and ceftazidime with the
autoSCAN-4 read with turbidity inoculation, MIC results of 2 or 4 μg/mL should be
confirmed by manual read prior to reporting.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
MicroScan panels can be read either manually or automatically on the WalkAway or autoScan-4
instrument systems.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo panel with ceftazidime is used to determine
the quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of aerobic and facultatively
anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli colonies grown on solid media. After inoculation, panels are
incubated for 16-20 hours at 35°C ± 1° in a non-CO2 incubator and read either visually or with
MicroScan instrumentation according to the package insert.
Inoculation methods: Turbidity or Prompt Inoculation System
Read methods: Manual, MicroScan WalkAway System and MicroScan autoSCAN-4
B Principle of Operation:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are dehydrated miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in Mueller Hinton broth

--- Page 4 ---
supplemented with calcium and magnesium to concentrations spanning the range of clinical
interest. Breakpoint Combo panels use concentrations equivalent to the categorical breakpoints
determined or recognized by FDA. After inoculation and rehydration with a standardized
suspension of organism and incubation at 35°C for a minimum of 16 hours, the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is determined by observing the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.

• Guidance for Industry and FDA - Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems – August 28, 2009.
• CLSI M07, 10th ed., “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for

Twenty-Ninth Informational Supplement, January 2020”.
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at four clinical sites using 10 isolates of Gram-
negative bacilli that were consistent with the intended use. The range of ceftazidime dilutions
tested was 0.5 – 64 µg/mL. Isolates were tested in triplicate over three days at three of the
four clinical sites (27 data points per isolate). The quality control strain was out of range on
one testing day which excluded data from that day, resulting in 267 total data points. The
isolates tested in the reproducibility study included: A. baumannii (1 isolate), E. coli (2
isolates), K. oxytoca (1 isolate), K. pneumoniae (1 isolate), and P. aeruginosa (5 isolates).
Inocula were prepared using both the turbidity and Prompt methods and results were read
manually (visually) and with the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 instrument systems. The mode
(or median for results without a mode) of MIC values was determined for each isolate and
the reproducibility was calculated based on the number of MIC values that fell within ± one
doubling dilution of the mode/median MIC value. The majority of data points were within ±
one doubling dilution of the mode/median MIC value. The data was analyzed as described in
the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST)
Systems. For those read/inoculation combinations that included off-scale results,
reproducibility was assessed as best-case and worst-case scenarios (Table 1).

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Inoculum Density Check. A spectrophotometric device, the MicroScan Turbidity Meter,
was used to ensure the accuracy of the turbidity inoculation method. A zero check of the
turbidity meter was performed daily. The inocula prepared using the turbidity method were
standardized using a reading of 0.08 ± 0.02 (equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland barium sulfate
turbidity standard). The digital reading was recorded for each isolate and was considered
acceptable based on recommendations in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. Inoculum density colony counts were
evaluated from suspensions of the QC strain E. coli ATCC 25922 and were found to be
within the acceptable concentration range as recommended in the CLSI document M07,
Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow Aerobically.
Inoculum density data was collected for the Prompt inoculum preparation of all
reproducibility isolates and weekly testing of QC strain E. coli ATCC 25922, was well as
monthly QC testing with the turbidity inoculation method. The overall average colony count
was within the acceptable range for all isolates.
Purity Check. Purity checks were performed on all isolates for each inoculum preparation;
only results from pure cultures were included.
Growth Failure Rate. During the clinical study, one isolate failed to grow on the dried test
panels and frozen reference panel which is acceptable (<10% growth failure).
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI-recommended QC organisms E. coli ATCC 25922 and
P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were tested with all inoculation and read methods using 8
dilutions of ceftazidime (0.5 – 64 µg/mL). The reference panel was inoculated using the
turbidity method only. In this submission, the QC range for both E. coli ATCC 25922 and P.
aeruginosa reflect the current MIC ranges recommended in the CLSI document M100,
Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing 30th ed. Results of QC
testing are shown in Table 2. For both QC strains, quality control results were within the
acceptable range for all inoculation and read methods for >95% of tests which is acceptable.

The results obtained with the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel with
Ceftazidime (dilution range 0.5 – 64 µg/mL) were compared to results obtained using a
frozen broth microdilution reference panel (dilution range 0.5 – 64 µg/mL). Clinical isolates
were evaluated in two studies at four testing sites in the U.S.; challenge isolates were
evaluated in three separate studies performed at an internal and two external sites.
The reference panel was prepared as described in CLSI document M07-A10 (as well as M07-
A9 and M07-A8; each of which were effective at various points in the clinical trial), except
for the use of Pluronic-F (wetting agent) in the inoculum water for the reference panel. A
summary of historical data from eight previously cleared antimicrobial tests was provided in
the submission which demonstrated that inclusion of the wetting agent did not affect testing.
In addition, QC testing conducted during the clinical study was acceptable.

For the reference method and MicroScan panels inoculated using the turbidity method,
panels were inoculated using the same standardized suspension further diluted into 25 mL of
inoculum water with Pluronic-D (for the MicroScan panels) or Pluronic-F (for the frozen
reference panels). MicroScan panels were also inoculated using the Prompt inoculation
method with isolates inoculated into the Prompt inoculation bottle. Reference panels were
read manually (visually) after 16-20 hours (20-24 hours for Acinetobacter spp.); MicroScan
panels inoculated with both inoculation methods were read using the WalkAway and
autoSCAN-4 instruments and by manual read after 16-18 hours.
Clinical Study
To determine the performance of the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel
with Ceftazidime, a total of 1373 Gram-negative clinical isolates [Acinetobacter spp. (74
isolates), B. cepacia complex (8 isolates), Enterobacterales (1082 isolates), P. aeruginosa
(161 isolates), and S. maltophilia (48 isolates)] were evaluated with all inoculation and read
methods at four sites. The Enterobacterales isolates tested include the following indicated
species: C. freundii (40 isolates), C. koseri (47 isolates), Citrobacter spp. (10 isolates),
Enterobacter spp. (87 isolates), E. coli (283 isolates), Klebsiella spp. (260 isolates), M.
morganii (52 isolates), P. mirabilis (142 isolates), P. vulgaris (16 isolates), P.
vulgaris/penneri (1 isolate), Providencia spp. (42 isolates), Salmonella spp. (19 isolates),
Serratia spp. (66 isolates), Shigella spp. (2 isolates). An additional 15 isolates of non-
indicated Enterobacterales species (1.1% of the total number of clinical isolates tested) were
also tested and included in the performance evaluation.
Performance when testing B. cepacia complex, S. maltophilia, Providencia spp. and M.
morganii was not acceptable. These species were excluded from the intended use for the
MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel with Ceftazidime. As such, 1223
clinical results were included in the performance evaluation. The following limitation for
reporting results with these organisms is included in the device labeling:
Results obtained with the organism/antimicrobial agent combinations listed below have
shown discrepant MIC’s when compared with an overnight reference method. If the
antimicrobial agent is critical to patient care, an alternate procedure should be used.
Ceftazidime: Burkholderia cepacia complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Providencia
spp. and Morganella morganii
Of the 1223 clinical isolates with results included in the performance analysis, 950 (77.7%)
were fresh isolates tested within one week of isolation, 152 (12.4%) were
recent/contemporary isolates (isolated from clinical specimens and tested within six months
of isolation with minimal sub-culturing), and 121 (9.9%) were stock isolates.
Challenge Study
A total of 128 Gram-negative challenge isolates [Acinetobacter spp. (13 isolates),
Enterobacterales (92 isolates), and P. aeruginosa (23 isolates)] were evaluated at two sites.
All Enterobacterales isolates were indicated species on the FDA-approved drug label which
included the following: C. freundii (5 isolates), C. koseri (2 isolates), Enterobacter spp. (5
isolates), E. coli (26 isolates), Klebsiella spp. (27 isolates), P. mirabilis (1 isolate), P.
vulgaris (3 isolates), Salmonella spp. (6 isolates), Serratia spp. (9 isolates), Shigella spp. (1
isolate), Y. enterocolitica group (7 isolates).
K202343 - Page 8 of 17

--- Page 9 ---
Results for essential agreement, categorical agreement, and categorical errors for
Acinetobacter, Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa for all inoculation and read methods are
shown in Table 3 and Table 4 below. Essential agreement of evaluable results was
calculated considering MIC results that were clearly identical to reference method results or
clearly one doubling dilution higher or lower than the reference method results. Performance
was evaluated separately for each organism group (i.e., Acinetobacter, Enterobacterales and
P. aeruginosa) due to differences in susceptibility test interpretive criteria.
For P. vulgaris, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Serratia spp. and Y. enterocolitica, no
resistant isolates were available for evaluation during clinical or challenge testing. The
sponsor included the following limitation in the device labeling:
The ability of the MicroScan Dried Gram Negative Panels to detect resistance to
ceftazidime is unknown for the following species because an insufficient number of
resistant strains were available at the time of comparative testing: P. vulgaris, Shigella
spp., Salmonella spp., Serratia spp. and Y. enterocolitica. Isolates yielding MIC results
suggestive of a resistant interpretive category should be submitted to a reference
laboratory.

Essential agreement (EA) occurs when the result of the reference method and that of the MicroScan Dried Gram-
Negative MIC/Combo Panel are within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Category
agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the
interpretation provided by the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel.
The overall EA and CA performance for Acinetobacter spp. for the WalkAway, autoSCAN-
4, and manual read methods were acceptable (> 90%) for each inoculation method. One
major error (MAJ) was observed for each read method using the prompt inoculation method
resulting in MAJ rate of 2.7% (1/36) which is acceptable. One very major error (VMJ) was
observed for each read and inoculation method resulting in a VMJ rate of 2.0% (1/50) which
is acceptable.

The overall EA and CA performance for Enterobacterales for the WalkAway, autoSCAN-4,
and manual read methods were acceptable (> 90%) for each inoculation method. A range of
MAJ rates were observed for the different read and inoculation methods: 0.3% (3/896) to
2.1% (19/896), which are acceptable. Three VMJs were observed for each read and
inoculation method, except the autoSCAN-4 read method using the turbidity inoculation
method, resulting in a VMJ rate of 1.8% (3/165), which is acceptable. The autoSCAN-4 read
method using the turbidity inoculation method generated a fourth VMJ resulting in a VMJ
rate of 2.4% (4/165), which is acceptable.
When the performance for Enterobacterales was evaluated individually by species, it was
noted the essential agreement was not acceptable (< 90%) for the following species and
inoculation/read methods: Enterobacter spp. across all read methods using the prompt
inoculation method and the manual read method using the turbidity, Proteus vulgaris
with the WalkAway and Manual read methods using both inoculation methods, and Serratia
spp. with all read methods using the Prompt inoculation method. This is addressed in the
following limitations in the device labeling:
Results obtained with Enterobacter spp. and ceftazidime for all read methods with the
Prompt inoculation system and manual reads with turbidity inoculation were within
categorical agreement, but outside of essential agreement when compared to the
reference method. If critical to patient care, Enterobacter spp. isolates should be retested
using an alternate method.
Results obtained with Proteus vulgaris and ceftazidime for the WalkAway and Manual
read methods with both the Prompt and turbidity inoculation methods were within
categorical agreement, but outside of essential agreement when compared to the
reference method. If critical to patient care, Proteus vulgaris isolates should be retested
using an alternate method.
Performance of ceftazidime when testing Serratia species using the Prompt Inoculation
system with the WalkAway, autoSCAN-4 or manual read methods were outside of
essential agreement and categorical agreement compared to the reference method and
shall only be tested using the turbidity inoculation method.
When evaluating performance of C. freundii complex, one very major error was observed
with all read and inoculation methods, resulting in a VMJ rate of 7.1% (1/14), which is not
acceptable. This is addressed with the following footnote to the Performance Characteristics
table in the device labeling:
One C. freundii complex strain resulted in a very major error with ceftazidime when
compared to the reference method across all read and inoculation methods.
When evaluating performance of Citrobacter spp., one major error was observed with all
read methods using the Turbidity inoculation method, resulting in a MAJ rate of 11.1% (1/9),
which is not acceptable. This is addressed with the following footnote to the Performance
Characteristics table in the device labeling:
One Citrobacter spp. strain resulted in a major error with ceftazidime when compared to
the reference method with all read methods and turbidity inoculation method.
K202343 - Page 12 of 17

--- Page 13 ---
When evaluating performance Klebsiella spp., one very major error was observed with all
read and inoculation methods, resulting in a VMJ rate of 1.6% (1/64), except the autoSCAN-
4 read method using the Turbidity inoculation method which has two very major errors,
resulting in a VMJ rate of 3.1% (2/64), which is not acceptable. This is addressed in the
following limitation in the device labeling:
Due to the occurrence of very major errors with Klebsiella spp. and ceftazidime with the
autoSCAN-4 read with turbidity inoculation, MIC results of 2 or 4 μg/mL should be
confirmed by manual read prior to reporting.
When evaluating performance of Serratia spp., a range of MAJ rates was observed with all
read methods when using the Turbidity inoculation method: 0% (0/73) to 1.4% (1/73), which
is acceptable. A range of MAJ rates was observed with all read methods when using the
Prompt inoculation method: 4.1% (3/73) to 17.8% (13/73), which is not acceptable. This is
addressed in a limitation in the device labeling (described above) to only test Serratia spp.
with the turbidity inoculation method.
The overall EA and CA performance for Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the WalkAway,
autoSCAN-4, and manual read methods were acceptable (> 90%) for each inoculation
method. A range of MAJ rates were observed for the different read and inoculation methods:
2.0% (3/151) to 4.6% (7/151). In addition, a range of VMJ rates were observed for the
different read and inoculation methods: 0% (0/33) to 6.1% (2/33). Due to the lack of an
intermediate interpretive criteria for ceftazidime with P. aeruginosa, further analysis of the
errors is performed and adjustments are made by considering the MIC values where the
errors occurred. All major errors generated with each inoculation and read method had an
MIC value that was one doubling dilution from the reference result and thus in essential
agreement (EA), except for four MIC values obtained with the WalkAway read method using
the Prompt inoculation method resulting in an adjusted MAJ rate of 2.6% (4/151) which is
acceptable. In addition, all very major errors generated with each inoculation and read
method had an MIC value that was one doubling dilution from the reference result and thus
in essential agreement (EA), except for one MIC value obtained with the autoSCAN-4 read
method using the turbidity inoculation method resulting in an adjusted VMJ rate of 3.0%
(1/33) which is not acceptable. This has been addressed in the following footnote to the
performance characteristics table in the device labeling:
The major error rate for ceftazidime was high for P. aeruginosa with
Prompt/WalkAway/Manual and turbidity/WalkAway/Manual read and inoculation
methods. The very major error rate was high with turbidity/all reads and
Prompt/autoSCAN-4. All major errors and very major errors were one dilution apart
from the reference method and as such fall within essential agreement, with the exception
of turbidity/autoSCAN-4/manual methods. Based on the essential agreement and lack of
an intermediate breakpoint for ceftazidime, the adjusted major error rate for P.
aeruginosa with Prompt/WalkAway/Manual and turbidity/Manual meets acceptance
criteria, and the adjusted very major error rate for P. aeruginosa with
Prompt/autoSCAN-4 and turbidity/WalkAway meets acceptance criteria. One P.
aeruginosa strain was outside of essential agreement and resulted in a very major error
compared to the reference method when using the turbidity/autoSCAN-4/manual
methods.

For this review, the interpretative criteria are applied to the organisms/organism groups
according to the FDA STIC website. As required under 511A(2)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act, the following statement is added to the Warnings and Precautions section of
the device labeling:
The safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is
tested by this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-
controlled clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of
those found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.
Trending
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
with each organism group for each inoculation and read method (Table 5). This trending
calculation analyzes device MIC values that are one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher
than the reference method MIC values. MIC values that are off-scale for both the reference and
device are not considered in the trending analysis. Organism groups or species for which the
difference between the percentage of isolates with higher or lower MIC values was ≥30% with a
statistically significant confidence interval were considered to have evidence of trending and is
addressed in device labeling.

No trending was observed for Acinetobacter spp., P. aeruginosa or Enterobacterales organism
groups with all inoculation and read methods, except for trending toward lower MIC values with
Acinetobacter spp. using the turbidity inoculation / autoSCAN-4 read method. At a species level,
a bias for higher MIC values was observed for Proteus spp. across all read methods and both
inoculation methods, as well as Serratia spp. across all read methods with Prompt inoculation. A
bias for lower MIC values was observed for Citrobacter freundii complex with all reads with the
turbidity inoculation and Klebsiella spp. with the WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 reads with
turbidity inoculation. These are addressed in the following footnotes to the performance table in
the device labeling:
Ceftazidime MIC values for Enterobacterales were most frequently in exact agreement
with the reference method. When not in agreement results tended to be one doubling
dilution higher for Proteus spp. with all read/all inoculation methods and Serratia spp.
with all read methods/Prompt inoculation. When not in agreement results tended to be
one doubling dilution lower for Citrobacter freundii complex with all read
methods/turbidity inoculation, and Klebsiella spp. with the WalkAway/autoScan-
4/turbidity inoculation.
Ceftazidime MIC values for Acinetobacter spp. were most frequently in exact agreement
with the reference method. When not in agreement results tended to be one doubling
dilution lower for Acinetobacter spp. with the autoSCAN- 4/turbidity inoculation.
Resistance Mechanism Characterization
Challenge isolates of Acinetobacter, Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa harboring various
molecular mechanisms of resistance were tested with ceftazidime. Challenge isolates included
strains from the CDC and FDA Antibiotic Resistance Isolate Bank for evaluation.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that Beckman Coulter
intends to use to evaluate the MicroScan Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panels with
Ceftazidime (Caz) (0.5 – 64 μg/mL) when revised breakpoints for ceftazidime are published on

the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the submission indicated
that if specific criteria are met, Beckman Coulter will update the ceftazidime device label to
include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-evaluation of data in
this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined
by their evaluation.
