4. Panel:
83- Microbiology
H. Indication(s) for use:
1. Indications for use(s):
The FilmArray Global Fever Panel External Control Kit contains Positive and Negative
External Controls intended for use as assayed quality controls to monitor the performance
of in vitro diagnostic laboratory nucleic acid testing procedures for the qualitative
detection of FilmArray Global Fever Panel targets on FilmArray 2.0 systems. The Global
Fever Panel External Control Kit is designed for and intended to be used solely with the
FilmArray Global Fever Panel. This product does not replace manufacturer internal
controls provided as part of the Global Fever Panel device.
Both the Positive and Negative External Controls are provided in a FilmArray Control
Injection Vial format. The Positive Control Injection Vial contains dried synthetic DNA
segments in buffer and stabilizer to assess the presence of each individual assay on the
FilmArray Global Fever Panel. The Negative Control Injection Vial contains no DNA,
and is non-reactive with the Global Fever Panel assays.
2. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use only
For prescription use only
3. Special instrument requirements:
The FilmArray Global Fever Panel External Control Kit were evaluated on the FilmArray
2.0 System.
I. Device Description:
The FilmArray Global Fever Panel External Control Kit contains Positive and Negative
External Controls. The Positive External Control has been optimized to be detected by all
pathogen assays contained in the Global Fever Panel (Table 1). The Negative External
Control contains no nucleic acid and a successful run will be negative for all assays on the
panel. These controls are not intended to replace the internal FilmArray Global Fever Panel
pouch controls (RNA process control and second stage PCR array control). The Global Fever
Panel External Control Kit contains no biological hazards and is 100% non-infectious.

The External Controls are referenced in the Quick Guide and product literature as Control
Injection Vials. The use of room-temperature stable External Controls contained within an
injection vial simplifies the workflow and allows for use of the External Controls in settings
where access to refrigeration may be limited. Each individually packaged, ready-to-use
FilmArray Global Fever External Control is processed separately according to the
Instructions for Use, and follows the procedure as outlined in the Quick Guide for the
FilmArray Global Fever External Control Kit. Each External Control Injection Vial is
intended for a single use.
The Global Fever Panel External Control Kit is designed to mitigate the risk of control
contamination and misuse when evaluating clinical samples on the FilmArray 2.0
System.
• Negative External Controls are tested using the Negative External Control
protocol, which monitors for contamination from both external control material
and target pathogens; it will fail if either is detected.
• The Positive External Control contains DNA sequences that produce signature
amplicon melting temperature (Tm) values distinct from the amplicon Tm values
produced by each of the pathogens detected by the Global Fever Panel. By design,
the Positive ECM will not be detected when using the Global Fever Panel Whole
Blood Protocol, and reciprocally, amplified pathogen-specific nucleic acid will
not be detected when using the Positive External Control Protocol. Through
modification of the sequence between the inner primers for each ECM target, the
Tm value of the amplicon is shifted to higher or lower Tm values relative to the
expected Global Fever Panel target amplicon while running the same Global
Fever Panel pouches with the same physical pouch manipulation in the FilmArray
2.0 Instrument. Positive External Control-specific pouch module software detects
the expected shifted Tm values as being from ECM amplicon, thereby evaluating
the performance of the FilmArray 2.0 System. Also, the modification of the ECM
sequence mitigates possible contamination events and does not cause false
positives in clinical samples. In the unlikely event that Positive ECM or ECM
amplicon is introduced into a patient sample, the resulting amplification Tm
value(s) is not detected within the pathogen(s) Tm window in the Global Fever

The results suggest that there are no significant differences between different users
and different sites on different days. External reproducibility studies for the
Global Fever Panel External Control Kit are acceptable.

A precision study for the Global Fever Panel External Control Kit was conducted
over fourteen days by testing one Global Fever Panel External Control Kit lot with
one FilmArray Global Fever Panel pouch lot performed by one operator using one
FilmArray 2.0 instrument. A total of 90 external controls were tested (45 Positive and
45 Negatives ECM). Cp values for each analyte are provided for informational

d. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
e. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Not applicable
Stability:
Open Vial Stability:
Not applicable because FilmArray Global Fever External Control Kitis packaged for
single use.
Real-Time Stability Program:
Real-time stability studies are ongoing to support product claims and to monitor
potential assay modifications for which the the FilmArray Global Fever External
Control Kit is indicated for use. Real-time stability study protocols and acceptance
criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Shipping Stability:
A FilmArray Global Fever External Control Kit shipping stability study was
performed to confirm the shipping process and to investigate the outcome of a
possible shipping delay. The study evaluated the Global Fever External Control Kit at
low and high temperatures for a predefined amount of time prior to being stored at
30±2°C.
The study demonstrated that the FilmArray Global Fever External Control Kit is
stable for nine months at 18-30°C as indicated in the package insert.
Expected Values:
When performed properly, FilmArray Global Fever Panel External Controls should
yield the result ‘Passed’. Note that there are individual protocols for the FilmArray
Global Fever Panel Positive and Negative External Controls; therefore, it is
necessary to ensure that the appropriate protocol is selected prior to running the test.
If the result is ‘Failed’, the operator will be instructed to retest the External Control
once, either immediately (Positive External Control) or after decontaminating the
workspace (Negative External Control). If the result is ‘Invalid’, the operator will be
instructed to retest the External Control once and to contact Technical Support if the
