in clinical laboratories as an in vitro test to determine the susceptibility of clinically significant
aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms to antimicrobial agents when used as instructed.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems, VITEK 2 Systems (PC) version 9.04
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is essentially a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each
VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well which only contains microbiological
culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of a
specific antibiotic combined with culture media. The bacterial or yeast isolate to be tested is
diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45 – 0.5% saline before being used to rehydrate
the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals and
places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing
K202396 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that
contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained
on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GP Fosfomycin has the following concentrations in the card: 8, 16, 32, and 128
μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The MIC result range
for the VITEK 2 AST-GP Fosfomycin test is ≤ 8 – ≥ 256 µg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis. For
all species, the MIC result range indicates that the VITEK 2 system is capable of producing the
following MIC results ≤ 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and ≥ 256 µg/mL for the AST-GP Fosfomycin test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems uses visible light
to directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well measures organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

2018)
• CLSI M100-M30, “Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing”;
Thirtieth Edition (January 2020)
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-GP card with Fosfomycin was conducted at three
clinical sites using a panel of ten Enterococcus faecalis isolates. Each isolate was tested in
triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. Inocula were prepared using both the
auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2 System. In addition,
inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method for use with the VITEK 2 Compact. The
mode of MIC values was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was calculated
based on the number of MIC values that fell within ±1 doubling dilution of the mode MIC value.
The data was analyzed taking into consideration best-case and worst-case scenarios as described
in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST)
Systems.
All MIC values were on-scale and within one doubling dilution of the mode MIC. The testing
resulted in overall reproducibility of 100% for each dilution method and VITEK 2 system, which
is acceptable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Quality Control (QC) Testing
The CLSI recommended QC strains, namely Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and
Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, were tested a sufficient number of times (i.e., at least
20/site) at each testing site using both the VITEK 2 card and agar dilution (AD) reference
method. Both the automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK
2 and the manual dilution method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact. The results are
summarized in Table 1 below.

The VITEK 2 AST-GP Fosfomycin reporting range (≤8 to ≥256 μg/mL) does not include the
CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution range for QC testing of S. aureus ATCC 29213 (0.5 - 4
µg/mL). As such, VITEK result with ≤ the lowest dilution on the card (i.e., ≤ 8 μg/mL) was
considered to be “in-range”. This is addressed in the following footnote to the S. aureus QC
result range within the Quality Control table in the device labeling:
Does not include the CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution range for QC testing with this
organism.
Acceptance of QC results for the VITEK 2 AST-GP Fosfomycin was based on the Enterococcus
faecalis ATCC 29212 strain since they provided results confirming the range.
Both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods for VITEK 2 and the manual dilution for
VITEK 2 Compact QC results were within the expected range >95% of the time, which is
acceptable.
Two ancillary quality control organisms were tested throughout comparative testing by agar
dilution reference method only. This was done to perform further quality control of the agar
dilution plates. The organisms tested were Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa ATCC 27853. QC results for the agar dilution method were within the expected
result range >95% of the time. E. coli ATCC 25922 was within range 98.1% (205/209) and P.
aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was within range 97.6% (206/211).
Inoculum Density Control
The DensiCHEK Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a 0.5 McFarland standard. The
instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at each site. Calibration values were
within the expected range.
Purity Check
A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to prepare the VITEK 2
card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in the study.
Growth Failure Rate
A total of 399 clinical and challenge isolates were tested by VITEK 2 Fosfomycin. No growth
failure was recorded and all 399 isolates have VITEK 2 AST results available.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Testing of fosfomycin on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive card was performed at five
clinical sites. There were 316 clinical isolates and 83 challenge isolates tested for a total of
399 isolates. Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive card with fosfomycin
K202396 - Page 7 of 11

--- Page 8 ---
were compared to results obtained with the CLSI recommended agar dilution testing
conditions. The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Fosfomycin is ≤8 to
≥256 μg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis. The reference method testing consisted of two-fold
serial dilutions of fosfomycin with a range of ≤8 to ≥256 μg/mL. The testing conditions for
the reference method consisted of the following:
• Medium – Mueller Hinton agar with addition of 25 µg/mL of glucose-6-phosphate
and appropriate dilutions of antimicrobial solution added
• Inoculum – Direct colony suspension
• Incubation – 35°C ± 2°C; 16-20 hours
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test inocula
used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using the
DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 316 clinical isolates were evaluated at five sites: 25.9% were considered
contemporary isolates (isolated from clinical specimen and tested within 6 months) and
74.1% were stock isolates. Complete test results are available for all 316 clinical isolates. All
clinical isolates were tested with the auto-dilution option of the VITEK 2.
A total of 83 E. faecalis challenge isolates were evaluated at one site. The challenge set was
tested with the auto-dilution and manual dilution options of the VITEK 2 and with the
manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact.
At the time of comparative testing, a sufficient number of resistant isolates were not available
for E. faecalis. The following statement is included in the Limitations section of the device
labeling:
The ability of the AST card to detect resistant strains with the following combination(s) is
unknown because an insufficient number of resistant strains were available at the time of
comparative testing.

MIC Trends
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method for E. faecalis (Table 4). This trending calculation
analyzes device MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or
higher than the reference method. MIC values that are off-scale for both the reference and device
are not considered in the trending analysis. Species for which the difference between the
percentage of isolates with higher or lower MIC values was ≥30% with a statistically significant
confidence interval were considered to have evidence of trending.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GP Fosfomycin when revised breakpoints for
fosfomycin are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the
fosfomycin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
