IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The following are needed to conduct testing:
Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I Reagent Kit which contains:
Microparticles: 1 bottle (6.6 mL per 100 test cartridge / 33.8 mL per 600 test cartridge). Anti-
troponin I (mouse, monoclonal) coated microparticles in TRIS buffer with protein (bovine)
stabilizer. Minimum concentration: 0.035% solids. Preservative: ProClin 300.
Conjugate: 1 bottle (6.1 mL per 100 test cartridge / 33.8 mL per 600 test cartridge).
Anti-troponin I (mouse-human chimeric, monoclonal) acridinium-labeled conjugate in
MES buffer with protein (bovine) stabilizer and human IgG. Minimum concentration: 0.1
mg/L. Preservative: ProClin 300.
The following are also required to conduct testing but are not provided with the kit:
• Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay file

• Alinity Pre-Trigger Solution
• Alinity Trigger Solution
• Alinity i-series Concentrated Wash Buffer
• 09P1540 Alinity i Multi-Assay Manual Diluent
B Principle of Operation:
The Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay is an automated, two-step immunoassay
for the quantitative determination of cTnI in human plasma (lithium heparin) using CMIA
technology.
Sample and anti-troponin I antibody-coated coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined
and incubated. The cTnI present in the sample binds to the anti-troponin I coated
microparticles. The mixture is washed. Anti-troponin I acridinium-labeled conjugate is added
to create a reaction mixture and incubated. Following a wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger
Solutions are added.
The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit (RLU). There is a
direct relationship between the amount of cTnI in the sample and the RLU detected by the
system optics.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A study was performed using 1 lot of the Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I
reagent, 1 lot of the Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I Calibrators, and 1 lot of the
Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I Controls. The study was performed using fresh,
native lithium heparin plasma specimens within each of 5 concentration ranges (> 3 to 6
ng/L, 10 to 20 ng/L, 30 to 50 ng/L, and 100 to 300 ng/L, and 1000 to 4500 ng/L). Testing for
each sample was performed within the 8-hour stability claim for patient samples. The study
was performed over a minimum of 3 days. Each specimen was stored at room temperature
and tested in duplicate, twice in one day, on each of 3 instruments (for a total of 12 replicates
per sample) within 8 hours of collection. Within-laboratory precision includes within-run and
between-run variability. Reproducibility includes within-run, between-run, and between-
instrument variance components.

A second study was performed following the recommendations in the EP05-A3 guideline.
Testing was conducted using 3 lots of the Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I
reagent, 2 lots of the Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I Calibrators, and 1 lot of the
Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I Controls using 2 instruments. Three controls
were tested in duplicate, twice per day over 20 days. Within-laboratory variability contains
within-run, between-run, and between-day variability. Patient samples can only be stored for
8 hours at room temperature; therefore, 20-day precision studies were conducted with quality
control materials.

2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated using 10 lithium heparin plasma samples ranging in concentrations
from <2.7 pg/mL to >3,600 ng/L. The high samples and the low samples were native and the
intermediate samples were prepared by mixing high and low concentration samples. At least
four replicates were measured for each sample, and the mean of these replicates was used to
calculate the reported results. Deviations from linearity within the claimed range were never
observed to be greater than 15%.
Hook Effect
The sponsor demonstrated that there is no hook effect with the assay up to 500,000 ng/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Potentially Interfering Endogenous Substances
A study was performed based on the recommendations in the CLSI EP07, 3rd ed. guideline.
Each substance was tested at 2 levels of the analyte (approximately 15 ng/L and 500 ng/L for
bilirubin, total protein, and Intralipid and 15 ng/L and 200 ng/L for hemoglobin). Test results
from samples spiked with the potential interferent were compared to test results from the
control samples lacking the potential interferent. No significant interference (results of the

Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) and rheumatoid factor (RF)
Samples at 3 levels of the analyte (approximately 2.7, 15, and 500 ng/L) were spiked with
rheumatoid factor (RF) to concentrations of 1200 IU/mL and 1495 IU/mL and tested with the
Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay. RF at 1495 IU/mL decreased troponin
values up to -18.9%.
Specimens containing human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) were evaluated at 3 levels of
the analyte (approximately 2.7, 15, and 500 ng/L) with the Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity
Troponin-I assay. HAMA at 225 ng/mL decreased troponin values up to -11.0%.
Cross Reactants
A study was performed based on guidance from CLSI EP07, 3rd ed. Samples with cTnI
target concentrations of 2.3, 15, and 500 ng/L containing the cross-reactants at the
concentrations listed below were tested with the Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I
assay. Test results from samples spiked with the potential interferent were compared to test
results from the control samples lacking the potential interferent. There was no observed
cross-reactivity at the concentrations tested below.

The following additional interferences are described in the labeling:
Troponin autoantibodies have been reported to be present in approximately 10% to 20% of
patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) and may lead to falsely low troponin
assay results and delay in treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Therefore, a test
result that is inconsistent with the clinical picture and patient history should be interpreted
with caution.
Limitations
The following limitations are included in the labeling:
The Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay is susceptible to interference effects
from total protein > 8.8 g/dL. Total protein from 9.0 to 12.0 g/dL decreased troponin values
at 500 ng/L by up to -16.3%.

Specimens from patients who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies
for diagnosis or therapy may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). Such
specimens may show depressed values when tested with assay kits such as Alinity i STAT
High Sensitivity Troponin-I that employ mouse monoclonal antibodies. Additional
information may be required for diagnosis.
Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins, interfering
with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to animal serum
products can be prone to this interference, and anomalous values may be observed.
Additional information may be required for diagnosis.
The Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay is susceptible to interference effects
from HAMA > 150 ng/mL. HAMA at 225 ng/mL decreased troponin values up to -11.0%.
The Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay is susceptible to interference effects
from RF > 1200 IU/mL. RF at 1495 IU/mL decreased troponin values up to -18.9%.
Although the Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay is specifically designed to
minimize the effects of HAMA, heterophilic antibodies, and RF, assay results may be
impacted by these proteins.
Specimens from individuals with elevated levels of fibrinogen may demonstrate falsely
elevated values.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
2.7 to 3600.0 ng/L (ng/L) cTnI
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The Abbott Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I is traceable to the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material SRM2921. The sponsor’s
traceability scheme was reviewed and found acceptable.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) Test Protocol
The LoB was determined as described in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Testing was
performed using 4 sets of 4 zero-analyte samples tested with 5 replicates on 5 runs over the
course of 3 days. Testing was performed using 2 reagent lots and 1 instrument. Sixty
determinations were obtained for each reagent lot/instrument combination. LoB was
calculated using non-parametric analysis. The largest estimate across all reagent lot-
instrument combinations tested was 0.0 ng/L.
K202525 - Page 10 of 16

--- Page 11 ---
Limit of Detection (LoD) Test Protocol
The LoD was determined following the recommendations in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
Testing was performed using 2 reagent lots and 2 instruments. For each lot and instrument
combination, at least 5 native low-analyte lithium heparin plasma samples were tested over at
least 3 days, with 12 replicates per sample.
The parametric approach described in EP17-A2 was followed to determine the LoD. The
largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument combinations tested was 0.9 ng/L.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) Protocol
The LoQ was determined as the analyte level with a within-lab CV of ≤ 20% following the
recommendations in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Testing was completed using the same
parameters and sampling plan as described above in the LoD Test Protocol. For each reagent
lot-instrument combination, the within-laboratory precision for each sample, expressed as
%CV, was plotted against the mean concentration obtained for each sample. LoQ was
determined by this precision profile as the concentration where the %CV was less than 20%.
The largest estimate across all reagent lot-instrument combinations tested was 2.7 ng/L
The sponsor claims a LoB of 0.0 ng/L, and LoD of 0.9 ng/L, and an LoQ of 2.7 ng/L.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
See Clinical Cut-off Section below
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not applicable
2. Matrix Comparison:
A tube type comparison study was carried out following guidance from EP35, 1st Edition on
the Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay to determine if samples collected in
lithium heparin and lithium heparin separator blood collection tubes are equivalent. At least
40 fresh samples were collected in each tube type and then supplemented with native heparin
plasma samples to spike concentrations ranging from 2.7 ng/L to 3,500 ng/L. The results
indicate concentrations of samples are equivalent when heparin plasma is collected in lithium
heparin and lithium heparin separator blood collection tubes.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
A multi-center prospective study was performed to assess diagnostic accuracy of the Alinity i
STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay. Specimens were collected at 23 emergency
departments (EDs) from diverse locations within the US (i.e., rural and urban, small and
K202525 - Page 11 of 16

--- Page 12 ---
large, research and non-research) from 6171 subjects presenting to the ED with chest
discomfort or equivalent ischemic symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome. The
specimen collection sites represented geographically diverse EDs associated with primary
care hospitals and medical centers, reflecting regional, urban, and rural patient populations.
All subject diagnoses were adjudicated by a panel of board-certified cardiologists based on
the third universal definition of MI. The sample collection times were at 0 – 1 hour from
presentation to the ED and at the following time-point relative to the time from presentation:
1 – 3 hours, 3 – 6 hours, and ≥6 hours. Investigators and adjudicators were blinded to the
Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay device’s results. Adjudicators were also
blinded to site diagnoses. The observed MI prevalence in this study was 7.0%.
The specimens were collected in lithium heparin or lithium heparin separator tubes and tested
within 8 hours of sample collection. The specimens were evaluated using the Alinity i STAT
High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay. The results were analyzed using the serial sampling time
points collected as part of the ED visit.
The sensitivity and specificity results using the overall 99th percentile cutoff (27 ng/L) are
summarized in the following table.

The sponsor provided the following information in their labeling:
When using the female cutoff of 14 ng/L, the lower bound of the 95% CI for the PPV was as
low as 21.45%. Taking into consideration the lower bound of the 95% CI, up to 77.54% (at 0
to < 1 hour), 78.55% (at 1 to < 3 hours), 74.86% (at 3 to < 6 hours), and 65.62% (at ≥ 6
hours) of positive troponin results could come from females that are not having an MI. When
using the overall cutoff of 27 ng/L, the lower bound of the 95% CI for PPV was as low as
29.19%. Taking into consideration the lower bound of the 95% CI, up to 70.81% (at 0 to < 1
hour), 66.97% (at 1 to < 3 hours), 67.55% (at 3 to < 6 hours), and 61.55% (at ≥ 6 hours) of
positive troponin results could come from females that are not having an MI. Troponin
results should always be used in conjunction with clinical data, signs, and symptoms.
When using the male cutoff of 35 ng/L, the lower bound of the 95% CI for the PPV was as
low as 27.88%. Taking into consideration the lower bound of the 95% CI, up to 65.30% (at 0
to < 1 hour), 72.12% (at 1 to < 3 hours), 64.96% (at 3 to < 6 hours), and 56.38% (at ≥ 6
hours) of positive troponin results could come from males that are not having an MI. When
using the overall cutoff of 27 ng/L, the lower bound of the 95% CI for PPV was as low as
23.92%. Taking into consideration the lower bound of the 95% CI, up to 69.33% (at 0 to < 1
hour), 76.08% (at 1 to < 3 hours), 68.71% (at 3 to < 6 hours), and 61.72% (at ≥ 6 hours) of
positive troponin results could come from males that are not having an MI. Troponin results
should always be used in conjunction with clinical data, signs, and symptoms.
In the Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I clinical study, the percent of false
negatives for males using the sex-specific cutoff (35 ng/L) was up to 1.63% higher when
compared to the false negative rate for males when using the overall cutoff of 27 ng/L. When
using the male cutoff of 35 ng/L, 8.12% of males with MI had non elevated Alinity i STAT
High Sensitivity Troponin-I test results. When using the overall cutoff of 27 ng/L, 6.49% of
males with MI had non-elevated Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I test results.
Troponin results should always be used in conjunction with clinical data, signs, and
symptoms.

In the Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I clinical study, the percent of false
negatives for females using the sex-specific cutoff (14 ng/L) was up to 2.41% lower when
compared to the false negative rate for females when using the overall cutoff of 27 ng/L.
When using the female cutoff of 14 ng/L, 5.65% of females with MI had non-elevated
Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I test results. When using the overall cutoff of 27
ng/L, 8.06% of females with MI had non-elevated Alinity i STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-
I test results. Troponin results should always be used in conjunction with clinical data, signs,
and symptoms.
The following limitations are in the labeling regarding the clinical performance of this
device.
Using the established overall 99th percentile (27 ng/L), the lower end of the 95% confidence
interval (CI) for positive predictive value (PPV) for female subjects was as low as 29.19%,
and for male subjects was as low as 23.92% in the clinical validation study. Up to 70.81%
and 76.08% of positive troponin results could come from females and males, respectively,
without an MI.
Using the established sex specific 99th percentiles in the same study (female 14 ng/L, male
35 ng/L), the lower end of the 95% CI for PPV for female subjects was as low as 21.45% and
for male subjects was as low as 27.88%. Up to 78.55% and 72.12% of positive troponin
results could come from females and males, respectively, without an MI.
False negative rates using the overall cutoff for females and sex-specific cutoff for males
were higher compared to the false negative rates using the sex-specific cutoff for females and
overall cutoff for males. Refer to the SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS,
Clinical Results section of this package insert.
2. Clinical Specificity:
See Clinical Sensitivity above (Section VII. C. 1.).
D Clinical Cut-Off:
The cut-offs for this assay were determined based on the 99th percentile upper reference limit in
apparently healthy adults. Please see Expected Values/Reference Range below (Section VII. E.)
for the determination of the clinical cut-offs.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A reference range study was conducted based on guidance from CLSI EP28-A3c. Specimens
were collected from 1531 apparently healthy individuals in a US population with the following
levels of biomarkers:
Biomarker Male Female
Cardiac BNP (pg/mL) ≤ 25 ≤ 40
HbA1c (%) ≤ 6
GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) ≥ 60

Each specimen was stored frozen, thawed, and evaluated in replicates of one using the Abbott
ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay. The 99th percentiles described in the
following table for this population were determined using the robust statistical method described
in CLSI EP28-A3c.
Apparently Healthy N Age Range 99th Percentile 90% CI
Population (years) (ng/L) (ng/L)
Female 763 21-75 14 [12, 17]
Male 766 21-73 35 [27, 44]
Overall 1531 21-75 27 [22, 32]
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
