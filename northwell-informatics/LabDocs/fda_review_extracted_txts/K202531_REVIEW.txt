L-cysteine, L-glutamic acid, Vancomycin, Amphotericin B, Colistin, gelatin, HEPES Buffer,
sucrose and Phenol red. The Hank’s buffer creates a neutral environment to help increase the
stability of the virus. Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) acts as a protein stabilizer by forming a
protective film on the protein shell of the virus, making it less likely to break down and ensuring
the integrity of the virus. Vancomycin, Amphotericin B, and Colistin inhibit the proliferation of
competing bacteria and yeasts. L-glutamic acid serves as an auxiliary energy source to keep cell
and virus stability. HEPES buffer provides additional help to maintain a stable pH. Phenol red is
a pH indicator which serves as a visual quality control mechanism. The L-cysteine, gelatin, and
sucrose, helps in preserving the virus.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Shelf-life:
The shelf-life of the Azer Scientific Universal Transport Medium was determined to be 12
months from the date of manufacture when stored at 2-25°C. Three lots of Azer Scientific
Universal Transport Medium were assessed qualitatively at each time point for functionality
and physical characteristics using real time ageing studies. In the real time study, media lots
were held at 2-8°C, and 20-25°C for 12 months (T=0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months).
a) Appearance
To evaluate appearance, the different lots of the Azer Scientific Universal Transport Medium
were visually examined. The appearance of the product was observed to have no significant
color change (pink, transparent), precipitate, particulates, or cloudy appearance. All lots
tested at each time point passed the criteria for appearance when held at 2-8°C, and 20-25°C.
b) pH Stability
The pH of the media was used as one of the indicators to support product stability. For all the
tubes at each time point and each lot, the pH was within the targeted range of 7.3±0.2 when
held at 2-8°C and 20-25°C only.
c) Microbial contamination check
Microbial contamination was determined by incubating an appropriate number of Azer
Scientific Universal Transport Medium lots overnight at 37±2°C and examined for growth
contaminants. All lots tested at each time point and each temperature passed the criteria for
no contamination (no growth) when held at 2-8°C, and 20-25°C.
Sterility:
The Azer Scientific Universal Transport Medium is not claimed to be sterile nor is it
intended to be sterilized by the end user. To decrease the chances of contamination,
components of the Azer Scientific Universal Transport Medium are either sterilized by moist
heat sterilization or filter sterilization and the transport medium is filled aseptically under
controlled conditions. The swabs provided with the Azer Scientific Universal Transport
Medium are individually packaged and are sold as sterile.

Performance Testing - Viral Recovery:
Performance of the Azer Scientific Universal Transport Medium was evaluated by performing
culture-based recovery studies. The viral recovery study was conducted by spiking virus stock
Influenza A/Puerto Rico-8-9VMC2/1934 (H1N1), Human Adenovirus 10 JJ (AV), and Human
Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Strain A1998/3-2 (HRSV) into pooled, human nasopharyngeal
swab sample matrix tested as negative using an FDA cleared RT-PCR assay.
Performance evaluation was carried out using three (3) lots of test kits each including a PurFlock
Ultra 6" Sterile Revised Ultrafine Flock Swab w/Polystyrene Handle, 80 mm Breakpoint swab
provided with Azer Scientific Universal Transport Medium with serial dilutions of each virus
(10-1, 10-2, 10-3 and 10-4) spiked into negative clinical matrix in triplicate. Contrived samples
were held at both 2-8°C and 20-25°C for 0, 24, and 48 hours in a 96-well plate.
Samples in the 96-well plate were examined under the microscope for cytopathic effect (CPE)
after the appropriate incubation period for each virus time point. Viral titers of samples collected
at 0, 24, and 48 hours were calculated for recovery and determined by percent log reduction of
TCID /mL using the Reed-Muench method. Host cell lines used for the different viruses are
50
outlined in Table 1. Viral Recovery study data is outlined in Table 2. Any change of virus titer
that was within one log (+/-90%) from the baseline (time point 0) was considered acceptable.
