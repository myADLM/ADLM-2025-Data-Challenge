D Special Instrument Requirements:
MTM30l Blood Glucose and Ketone Meter
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The MTM301 Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System consists of the MTM301 Blood
Glucose and Ketone Meter, MTM301 Blood Glucose test strips, MTM301 Blood Ketone test
strips, MTM301 Glucose Control Solutions (Level 1 and Level 2), and MTM301 Ketone Control
Solutions (Level 1 and Level 2) along with labeling and packaging. The control solutions and
test strips can be purchased separately. The glucose and ketone test strips are the same, with the
exception of the name, as previously cleared in k170267 and k182593, respectively.
B Principle of Operation:
The meter and test strips use biosensor technology. The glucose test strips contain an enzyme
(glucose oxidase) that reacts to glucose present in blood, releasing electrons. The ketone test
strips contain an enzyme (D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase) that reacts to ketone present in
blood, releasing electrons. The meter applies a small electrical current to the test strip and
measures changes in the current caused by the reaction of glucose or ketone in the blood sample
to the enzyme in the test strip. The meter converts the measured current into blood glucose or
ketone reading that is displayed on the meter’s liquid crystal display. Both glucose and ketone
test strips are plasma-calibrated.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
MTM301 Blood Glucose and Ketone Meter
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose and ketone system is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the
finger only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
4. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The meter is automatically
coded.
K202534 - Page 3 of 13

--- Page 4 ---
5. Quality Control:
MTM301 Glucose Control Solutions (Level 1 and Level 2) and MTM301 Ketone Control
Solutions (Level 1 and Level 2) are available for use with the system. Each test strip vial is
marked with a control solution range (CTRL1 and CTRL2). The user is instructed to
compare the control results with the expected control ranges printed on the strip vial. Users
are given instructions on when to conduct control solution testing and to call customer
service if repeat testing with control material is out of range. The use will need to switch the
meter manually to control testing mode prior to the application of control solution. Control
solution testing results will be stored into the meter’s memory and indicated with “ctl” icon
and will not be used for calculating blood result averages.

Ketone Test Strip
The ketone precision performance was previously established in k182593.
2. Linearity:
The linearity of the glucose measurement function of the MTM301 Blood Glucose and
Ketone Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood spiked with glucose.
Eleven whole blood samples were adjusted to the following glucose concentration ranges (as
measured by YSI 2300): 19.7, 50.1, 80.7, 115, 160, 200, 260, 310, 420, 530 and 610 mg/dL.
Each level was measured using 3 test strip lots and the results compared with those obtained
from the YSI 2300. The summary of the linear regression analysis for each lot was as
follows:
Test Strip
Slope y-intercept R2 value
Lot #
Lot 1 1.0038 -0.5982 0.9995
Lot 2 1.0009 -0.4580 0.9995
Lot 3 0.9999 0.0542 0.9995
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20-600
mg/dL.
Ketone linearity was previously established in k182593.
Validation testing was performed demonstrating that the meter displays an alternate flashing
“Ket” icon and ‘HI” when the ketone measurement result is greater than 8.0 mmol/L and an
alternate flashing “Ket” icon with “LO” when the ketone measurement result is less than 0.1
mmol/L as intended.

Validation testing was performed demonstrating that the meter displays a static “HI” when
the glucose measurement result is greater than 600 mg/dL and a static “LO” when the
glucose measurement result is less than 20 mg/dL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Previously established in k141036 for glucose and in k182593 for ketone.
The sponsor includes the following limitations in the labeling for the MTM301 Blood
Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System:
• If you are taking acetaminophen or acetaminophen containing drugs (for example
Tylenol; at blood concentrations > 10 mg/dL) you may get inaccurate results with this
system.
• If you are taking Tolbutamide at blood concentrations > 15 mg/dL, you may get
inaccurate results with this system.
• If you are taking Ibuprofen or Ibuprofen containing drugs as Advil at blood
concentrations > 40 mg/dL, you may get inaccurate results with this system
• If you are taking Paralidoxime Iodide (PAM) or Paralidoxime Iodide (PAM) containing
drugs at blood concentrations > 50 mg/dL, you may get inaccurate results with this
system.
• If you have a disease or condition in which uric acid levels in your blood may be elevated
(>15 mg/dL), such as gout, you may get inaccurate results with this system.
• Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing since xylose may cause
inaccurate glucose results. Ask your doctor how long to wait before performing a glucose
test.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
20 - 600 mg/dL for Glucose
0.1 - 8.0 mmol/L for Ketone
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The glucose measurement functionality of the MTM301 Blood Glucose and Ketone
Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST SRM 917b glucose reference material. The
method comparison/lay-user study was performed using the YSI 2300 Glucose Analyzer
as the comparator method (see section VII.C.3).
The ketone measurement functionality of the MTM301 Blood Glucose and Ketone
Monitoring System is traceable to in-house standards prepared from commercially
available control materials. The method comparison/lay user study was previously
performed (k182593) using STANBIO ß-Hydroxybutyrate assay on the Beckman Coulter
AU480 as the comparator method.

Test Strip Stability
Protocols and acceptance criteria for the shelf-life and open vial stability for the
MTM301 Blood Glucose Test Strips were previously evaluated in k141036 and found to
support the claimed shelf life of 24 months when stored under conditions of 39-86°F and
a relative humidity of 10-85% and a 6 month open vial claim when stored under these
same conditions.
Shelf-life for the individually wrapped MTM301 Blood Glucose Test Strips was assessed
using real-time testing. The study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found acceptable to support the sponsor’s claimed shelf-life stability of 24 months when
stored at recommended storage conditions of 39-86°F (10-30°C) and 10-85% relative
humidity.
Shelf-life and open vial stability for the MTM301 Ketone Test Strips were evaluated
using real-time testing. Study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
acceptable to support the sponsor’s claimed shelf life of 18 months when stored at the
recommended storage conditions of 39-86°F (10-30°C) and 10-85% relative humidity
and an open vial stability of 3 months when stored under these same conditions.
Protocols and acceptance criteria for the shelf -life for the individually wrapped MTM301
Ketone Test Strips was previously evaluated in k182593 to support the claimed shelf life
of 18 months when stored under conditions of 39-86°F and a relative humidity of 10-
85%.

Glucose method comparison/lay user performance study:
To assess the performance of the glucose functionality of the MTM301 Blood
Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System in the hands of the intended users, the
sponsor performed a study with 350 lay-user participants. The users were responsible
for obtaining their own fingertip capillary sample and performing a blood glucose test
according to the instructions in the labeling. A total of 15 MTM301 Blood Glucose
and Ketone meters and 3 lots of MTM301 Blood Glucose Test Strip were used.
Results were analyzed by comparing the blood glucose results obtained by the lay
users with the MTM301 Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System against
results obtained with the laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300 glucose
analyzer). The glucose concentrations in the samples ranged between 63-494 mg/dL,
as measured by the YSI 2300 glucose analyzer. The samples included 16 native
samples with glucose concentration < 80 mg/dL and 131 samples with glucose
concentration > 250 mg/dL. The results compared to YSI 2300 glucose analyzer are

Results of linear regression analysis: y = 1.0091x - 1.9847, R² = 0.9785
Usability Assessment:
The usability of the system was assessed by questionnaires given to the operators of the system
following the conclusion of the glucose and ketone lay user studies where the participants read
the labeling documents without any assistance or guidance. The study participants then
independently completed meter setup, performed glucose/ketone measurement using
blood/control and retrieved/marked the test results in the same way as home users. The study
participants were asked to complete a usability questionnaire regarding ease of understanding of
information in the user manual and the ease of use when performing a blood ketone test. The
study demonstrated that users could use the combined glucose and ketone device with ease and
are able to interpret the different results and messages/errors appropriately under different user
scenarios.
From the sponsor’s analysis of the questionnaire responses, the participants overall were satisfied
with the ease of operation by following the instructions for use in the User’s Manual and the
overall performance of the MTM301 Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System.
Accuracy at Extreme Glucose Study:
A study to evaluate the performance of MTM301 Blood Glucose and Ketone
Monitoring System in the extreme lower and upper ends of the claimed range was
performed using 50 whole blood samples that were allowed to glycolyze to achieve
glucose concentrations below 80 mg/dL (22-79 mg/dL), and 50 whole blood samples that
were spiked to achieve glucose concentrations greater than 250 mg/dL (256-590 mg/dL).
Results on the candidate device using 3 test strip lots were compared to the results
obtained using the comparator method (YSI 2300 glucose analyzer). Results are
summarized below:
System accuracy results for extreme low (<80mg/dL) glucose readings
Within ± 5 % Within ± 10 % Within ± 15 % Within ± 20 %
17/50 (34%) 42/50 (84%) 50/50 (100%) 50/50 (100%)
System accuracy results for extreme high (>250mg/dL) glucose readings
Within ± 5 % Within ± 10 % Within ± 15 % Within ± 20 %
33/50 (66%) 48/50 (96%) 50/50 (100%) 50/50 (100%)
Labeling Readability
The readability of the over-the counter, home use labeling was evaluated using a Flesch-
Kincaid analysis and demonstrated that the grade level scores were less than 8th grade.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Flex Studies:
Studies were performed to assess the effect of the following measurement functions of the
candidate system: used test strip insertion, test strip removal during measurement countdown,
intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, and dropping. The testing demonstrated that the
MTM301 Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System is robust to these use scenarios and that
either an error message is returned, or an accurate result is displayed.
Operating Conditions:
The effect of operating temperatures and relative humidity on the performance of the MTM301
Blood Glucose and Ketone Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples
adjusted to approximately 60, 120, 200, 400 mg/dL and 3 levels of glucose control solution.
Testing was conducted under the following temperature and relative humidity (RH)
combinations: 10°C / 20% RH low temperature, low humidity); 10°C / 90% RH (low
temperature, high humidity); 40°C / 10% RH (high temperature, low humidity); 40°C / 90% RH
(high temperature, high humidity), and 24°C / 50% RH (nominal). Glucose results obtained
under these conditions was collected using 10 MTM301 meters and three lots of test strips and
results were compared to the nominal condition (25°C / 50% RH). The study results support the
claimed operating conditions of 10° to 40°C (50°F to 104°F) with relative humidity of 10% to
90%.
Disinfection (Robustness) Testing
This device system is for single patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were previously
performed (k141036) on the exterior meter materials by an outside commercial testing laboratory
demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant,
Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Registration # 67619-12). Robustness studies
were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in ketone or glucose
performance or external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection steps with the
Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5
years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.

Hematocrit:
Previously established in k141036 and k182593 to support the claimed hematocrit range of 20-
60% for glucose and ketone testing, respectively.
Altitude:
Previously established in k141036 and k182593 to support the use of the device up to 10,335 ft.
(3150 meters) for both glucose and ketone testing.
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC):
EMC and electrical safety testing were previously provided (k182593).
Sample Volume:
The minimum sample volumes were previously established to support a 0.5 μL sample volume
for glucose (k141036) and 0.8 μL sample volume for ketone (k182593).
Glucose Test Strip Lot Release Protocol:
Glucose test strip lot release protocols and criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
