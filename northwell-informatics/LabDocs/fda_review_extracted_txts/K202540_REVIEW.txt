B Principle of Operation:
The EliA Rib-P is a semi-quantitative solid-phase fluoroimmunoassay for the determination of
autoantibodies against Rib-P. The EliA Rib-P test is fully integrated and automated system
which comprises of assay-specific reagents, EliA method-specific reagents, and general reagents.
The antigen (human recombinant ribosomal P-proteins P0, P1, and P2) is immobilized on the
EliA solid phase component (EliA Well). The EliA wells are molded cups comparable to excised
wells from a microtiter plate. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to the ribosomal P-
proteins P0, P1, and P2 bind to their specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies,
enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to
form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away,
and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction,
the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The assay directly measures the amount of
antibody of interest bound to the antigen coating the EliA well, therefore the higher the value of
fluorescent signal detected by the instrument, the higher the amount of antibody bound and
detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is
compared directly to the response for calibrators.

2. Linearity:
Three patient serum samples with following concentrations: 452.6 EliA U/mL, 357.6 EliA
U/mL, 122.9 EliA U/mL, and 32.2 EliA U/mL were used for testing on the Phadia 250. Four
patient serum samples with following concentrations: 427.6 EliA U/mL, 34.3 EliA U/mL,
and 22.6 EliA U/mL were used for testing on the Phadia 2500E. All samples were serially
diluted with EliA Sample Diluent. Each dilution was tested in triplicate on one lot of the EliA
Rib-P assay reagents and one set of system reagents on Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500E
instruments. The ratios of observed/expected values were calculated. The observed values
were graphed against the calculated values and a linear regression analysis was performed.
The results are summarized in the tables below.

The results support the linearity of the claimed analytical measuring range (1.9–403 EliA
U/mL) for EliA Rib-P assay.
Hook Effect/Over the Range Results:
Results above the upper limit of the measuring range are reported as “>403”. No
recommendations are made for dilution of samples outside measuring range in the Package
Insert.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Comparison to Reference Sera:
CDC (Center for Disease Controls and Prevention) ANA Reference Panel samples 1–12 were
tested using one lot of EliA Rib-P assay reagents. Among the 12 sera in CDC Panel, the only
sera (#12) that was known to be positive for Rib-P was found to be reactive in the EliA Rib-P
assay as expected.

Endogenous and Exogenous Interference:
Three serum samples with concentration at 2.3 EliA U/mL (negative), around 9 EliA U/mL
(within the equivocal range), and 126.4 EliA U/mL (positive) were spiked with the different
interfering substances or the corresponding substance-specific blank solution. For lipemic
factor (ClinOleic), distilled water was used as the blank solution, and for the exogenous
substances EliA Sample Diluent was used as the blank solution. Additionally, three samples
with following concentrations: 87.7 EliA U/mL, 9 EliA U/mL, and 7.8 EliA U/mL were
tested for Rheumatoid factor interference. The samples were tested in triplicate in two runs
using one lot of EliA Rib-P Wells on a Phadia 250. The quotient between serum sample
spiked with interference substance and serum sample spiked with blank was calculated for
each sample spiked with the interfering substance. The quotient between samples spiked with
interference substance or blank were within the range of 0.90 – 1.10 The results are listed in
the table below:

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range for the EliA Rib-P is 1.9–403.0 EliA U/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
There is no international reference standard that recognizes Rib-P. EliA IgG calibrators and
EliA IgG Curve Controls are derived from a purchased immunoglobulin preparation
(GAMMANORM, Biovitrum AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The EliA IgG calibrators are
traceable via an unbroken chain of calibrations to the International Reference Preparation
(IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum Immunoglobulins A, G and M from WHO. New batches of
EliA IgG Calibrators are compared to a secondary standard (standardized with the IRP) or
the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct concentration.

Stability:
The stability for the EliA Rib-P assay-specific reagent (EliA Rib-P Wells) were determined
as follows:
Kit stability (shelf-life): The real-time shelf-life of the EliA Rib-P Wells was performed
using Phadia 250 instrument. Three lots of the wells were stored at 2–8°C and tested at seven
timepoints (0, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, and 37 months) in triplicate. The wells were tested with five
positive samples in triplicate determination and with nine negative samples in single
determination with a full calibration curve. The EliA IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control was
additionally tested in triplicate. The shelf-life of the EliA Rib-P assay was determined to be
36 months stored at 2–8°C.
Open-vial (in-use) stability: The real-time stability of the EliA Rib-P Wells stored at 2–8°C
after first opening of the foil bag was performed. The wells were tested at 4, 7 and 10 months
in two identical test runs with three positive samples in triple determination and two negative
samples in single determination on the Phadia 250. Each test run contained a full calibration
curve. The in-use stability for the EliA Rib-P assay was determined to be 9 months at 2–8°C.
On-board stability: The on-board stability of EliA Rib-P Wells was tested over four weeks
using five samples (three positive and two negative) on the Phadia 250 instrument. The on-
board stability EliA Rib-P assay was determined to be 28 days at 2–8°C.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), Limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of the EliA
Rib-P assay were determined on both Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500E.
The LoB was determined from the measurement of four analyte-free (i.e., IgG-depleted sera)
samples tested in five replicates per sample over three consecutive days using two lots of
EliA Rib-P reagents on two instruments. The LoB was calculated as the 95th percentile for
each lot (60 determinations per lot). LoB was determined as the higher value of these two
lots for each type of instrument. The claimed LoB for EliA Rib-P assay is the greatest LoB
across the two lots and both instrument types.
The LoD was determined by testing four low-level samples in five replicates per run per
sample over three consecutive days using two lots of EliA Rib-P reagents on two
instruments. The LoD for each lot was calculated based on 240 determinations with 120
blank and 120 low level replicates following recommendations of CLSI document EP17-A
and with proportions of false positives (α) less than 5% and false negatives (β) less than 5%.
The claimed LoD for EliA Rib-P assay is the greatest LoD across the two lots and both
instrument types.
The LoQ was determined by testing four low-level samples in five replicates per sample over
three days using two lots of EliA Rib-P reagents on two instruments. The LoQ was defined to
be the lowest concentration level that meets the within-laboratory imprecision of <20% for
each lot. The greatest LoQ across the two lots and both instrument types were set as the
claimed LoQ for EliA Rib-P assay.

The results are summarized in the table below:
Instrument LoB LoD LoQ
EliA U/mL EliA U/mL EliA U/mL
Phadia 250 0.0 0.5 1.9
E-module of the Phadia 2500E 0.1 0.4 1.1
The claim for both instrument types 0.1 0.5 1.9
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay cut-off and the equivocal range were established by testing a cohort consisting of
70 apparently healthy blood donors and 30 samples from SLE patients on a Phadia 250
instrument. The assay cut-offs were set as follows:
Decision Point Interpretation
< 7 EliA U/mL Negative
7–10 EliA U/mL Equivocal
> 10 EliA U/mL Positive
In case of equivocal results, the manufacturer recommends retesting the patient after 8–12
weeks.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Three hundred twenty-three (323) samples with antibody concentrations covering the
analytical measuring range were analyzed with EliA Rib-P and the predicate Quanta Lite
Ribosome P ELISA assay. All samples were found within the measuring ranges of both tests
and used for the method comparison analysis. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative
percent agreement (NPA), and total agreement were calculated with equivocal results
considered as negative or as positive, respectively. The results are summarized in the tables

2. Matrix Comparison:
Not applicable, serum is the claimed sample type for this assay.
3. Instrument Comparison:
This study compared the performance of the Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500E instruments using
the EliA Rib-P assay by evaluating 47 positive, 10 equivocal and 28 negative serum samples.
The samples were analyzed in single determination on one Phadia 250 and one Phadia 2500E
instrument each. The Passing-Bablok regression analysis showed the slope of 0.94 (95% CI:
0.93–0.98) and the intercept of -0.76 (95% CI: -1.20 – -0.48). The PPA, NPA, and total
agreement were calculated with equivocal results considered as negative or as positive,
respectively. The results are summarized in the tables below.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The expected value in the normal population is negative. A panel of 638 serum samples from
apparently healthy blood donors were collected from the Biobank at Phadia GmbH (Germany).
The set consisted following age groups: age ≤30 years (64 males, 64 females), 31–40 years (64
males, 64 females), 41–50 years (64 males, 64 females), 51–60 years (64 males, 64 females),
>60 years (62 males, 64 females). The panel included 400 samples from Caucasian origin, 238
samples from multiple ethnicities (80 samples from African Americans, 80 samples from
Hispanics, and 78 samples from Asian blood donors). One sample was found equivocal (7–10
EliA U/mL). The results are presented in the following table:
