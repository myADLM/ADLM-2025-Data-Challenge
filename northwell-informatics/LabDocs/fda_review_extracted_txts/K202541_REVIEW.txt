B Principle of Operation:
The EliA RNA Pol III is a semi-quantitative solid-phase fluoroimmunoassay for the
determination of autoantibodies against RNA polymerase III. The EliA RNA Pol III test system
is fully integrated and automated system which comprises of assay-specific reagents, EliA
method-specific reagents, and general reagents.
The antigen (human recombinant RNA polymerase III) is immobilized on the EliA solid phase
component (EliA Well). The EliA wells are molded cups comparable to excised wells from a
microtiter plate. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to the RNA polymerase III bind
to their specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies
against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate
complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away, and the bound complex is
incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the
reaction mixture is measured. The assay directly measures the amount of antibody of interest
bound to the antigen coating the EliA well, therefore the higher the value of fluorescent signal
detected by the instrument, the higher the amount of antibody bound and detected in the sample
tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the
response for calibrators.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Comparison to Reference Sera:
CDC (Center for Disease Controls and Prevention) ANA Reference Panel Samples 1–12
were tested using one lot of EliA RNA Pol III assay reagents. All 12 sera samples found to
be negative in the EliA RNA Pol III assay.
Endogenous Interference:
Three serum samples with following concentrations: 0.5 EliA U/mL (negative), 7 EliA U/mL
(within the equivocal range), and 106 EliA U/mL (positive) were used for endogenous
interference study. Additionally, three samples with following concentrations: 39 EliA
U/mL, 11.7 EliA U/mL, and 11.2 EliA U/mL were tested for Rheumatoid factor interference.
The samples were spiked with the different interfering substances or the corresponding
substance-specific blank solution. For lipemic factor (ClinOleic) distilled water was used as
the blank solution. The samples were tested in triplicate in two runs using one lot of EliA
RNA Pol III Wells on Phadia 250. The quotient between serum sample spiked with
interference substance and serum sample spiked with blank was calculated for each sample
spiked with the interfering substance. The quotient between samples spiked with interference
substance or blank were within the range of 0.90 – 1.10 The results are listed in the table

Exogenous Interference:
Three serum samples with following concentrations: 0.5 EliA U/mL (negative), 9 EliA U/mL
(within the equivocal range), and 67 EliA U/mL (positive) were used for exogenous
interference study. The samples were spiked with the different interfering substances or EliA
Sample Diluent as the blank solution. The samples were tested in triplicate in two runs using
one lot of EliA RNA Pol III Wells on Phadia 250. The quotient between serum sample
spiked with interference substance and serum sample spiked with blank was calculated for
each sample spiked with the interfering substance. The quotient between samples spiked with

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range for the EliA RNA Pol III is 0.7–192.0 EliA U/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
There is no international reference standard that recognizes RNA Pol III. EliA IgG
calibrators and EliA IgG Curve Controls are derived from a purchased immunoglobulin
preparation (GAMMANORM, Biovitrum AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The EliA IgG
calibrators are traceable via an unbroken chain of calibrations to the International Reference
Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum Immunoglobulins A, G and M from WHO. New
batches of EliA IgG Calibrators are compared to a secondary standard (standardized with the
IRP) or the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct concentration.
Stability:
The stability for the EliA RNA Pol III assay-specific reagent (EliA RNA Pol III Wells) were
determined as follows:
Kit stability (shelf-life): The shelf-life of the EliA RNA Pol III Wells was performed using
Phadia 250 instrument. Three lots of the wells were stored at 2–8°C and tested at four
timepoints (0, 7, 13, and 19 months) in triplicate determination. The wells were tested with
five positive samples in triplicate determination and with nine negative samples in single
determination with a full calibration curve. The EliA ANA 3 Positive Control and the EliA
IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control were additionally tested in triple determination. The shelf-life
of the EliA RNA Pol III assay was determined to be 18 months stored at 2–8°C.
Open-vial (in-use) stability: The stability of the EliA RNA Pol III Wells stored at 2–8°C after
first opening of the foil bag was performed. The wells were tested at 4, 6 and 10 months in
two identical test runs with three positive samples in triple determination and two negative
samples in single determination. Each test run contained a full calibration curve. The in-use
stability for the EliA RNA Pol III assay was determined to be 9 months at 2–8°C.
On-board stability: The on-board stability of EliA RNA Pol III Wells was tested over six
weeks using five samples (three positive and two negative) on the Phadia 250 instrument.
The on-board stability EliA RNA Pol III assay was determined to be 28 days at 2–8°C.

6. Detection Limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), Limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of the EliA
RNA Pol III assay were determined on both Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500E.
The LoB was determined from the measurement of four analyte-free (i.e., IgG-depleted sera)
samples tested in five replicates per sample over three consecutive days using two lots of
EliA RNA Pol III reagents on two instruments. The LoB was calculated as the 95th percentile
for each lot (60 determinations per lot). LoB was determined as the higher value of these two
lots for each type of instrument. The claimed LoB for EliA RNA Pol III assay is the greatest
LoB across the two lots and both instrument types.
The LoD was determined by testing four low-level samples in five replicates per run per
sample over three consecutive days using two lots of EliA RNA Pol III reagents on two
instruments. The LoD for each lot was calculated based on 240 determinations with 120
blank and 120 low level replicates following recommendations of CLSI document EP17-A
and with proportions of false positives (α) less than 5% and false negatives (β) less than 5%.
The claimed LoD for EliA RNA Pol III assay is the greatest LoD across the two lots and both
instrument types.
The LoQ was determined by testing four low-level samples on Phadia 2500E and five low-
level samples on Phadia 250 in five replicates per sample over three days using two lots of
EliA RNA Pol III reagents. The LoQ was defined to be the lowest concentration level that
meets the within-laboratory imprecision of <20% for each lot. The greatest LoQ across the
two lots and both instrument types were set as the claimed LoQ for EliA RNA Pol III assay.
The results are summarized in the table below:
Instrument LoB LoD LoQ

The claim for both instrument types 0.0 0.7 0.7
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay cut-off and the equivocal range were established by testing a cohort consisting of
70 apparently healthy blood donors and 17 samples from systemic sclerosis (diffuse) patients
on a Phadia 250 instrument. The assay cut-offs were set as follows:
Decision Point Interpretation
< 7 EliA U/mL Negative
7–10 EliA U/mL Equivocal
> 10 EliA U/mL Positive
In case of equivocal results, the manufacturer recommends retesting the patient after 8–12
weeks.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
One hundred ninety-three (193) serum samples with antibody concentrations covering the
measuring range were analyzed with EliA RNA Pol III and the predicate QUANTA Lite
RNA Pol III ELISA assay. Among them, 82 samples were found within the measuring ranges
of both tests and used for the method comparison analysis. Positive percent agreement (PPA),
negative percent agreement (NPA), and total agreement were calculated with equivocal
results considered as negative or as positive, respectively. The results are summarized in the

2. Matrix Comparison:
Not applicable. Serum is the claimed sample type for this assay.
3. Instrument Comparison:
This study compared the performance of the Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500E instruments using
the EliA RNA Pol III assay by evaluating 64 positive, 13 equivocal and 23 negative serum
samples. The samples were analyzed in single determination on one Phadia 250 and one
Phadia 2500E instrument each. The Passing-Bablok regression analysis showed the slope of
1.05 (95% CI: 1.04–1.07) and the intercept of -0.67 (95% CI: -1.13 – -0.44). The PPA, NPA,
and total agreement were calculated with equivocal results considered as negative or as
positive, respectively. The results are summarized in the tables below.

Not applicable
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Same as assay cut-off.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The expected value in the normal population is negative. A panel of 568 serum samples from
apparently healthy blood donors were collected from the Biobank at Phadia GmbH (Germany).
The set consisted of the following age groups: ≤30 years (57 males, 57 females), 31-40 years
(57 males, 57 females), 41-50 years (57 males, 57 females), 51-60 years (57 males, 57 females),
>60 years (55 males, 57 females). The panel included 330 Caucasian samples, 238 multi-
ethnicity donor samples (African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian blood donors). Two samples
were found equivocal (7–10 EliA U/mL). The results are presented in the following table:
