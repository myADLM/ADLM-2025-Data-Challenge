B Measurand:
Anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies
C Type of Test:
Chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA)
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
LIAISON Lyme IgG
The LIAISON Lyme IgG assay uses chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) technology for the
qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum and plasma
specimens (K2-EDTA, Li-heparin). This assay is intended for use on samples from patients with
signs and symptoms consistent with or patients suspected of having Lyme disease to assess the
presence of IgG antibodies and exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi. In addition, the LIAISON
Lyme IgG assay may be used as a confirmatory test in the modified two-tier test (MTTT) in
combination with the DiaSorin LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus assay.
If used as a first stage test, positive or equivocal results with the LIAISON Lyme IgG assay
should be confirmed through additional testing with a Standard two-tier test (STTT)
methodology using an IgG Borrelia burgdorferi Western blot assay following current guidelines.
Positive supplemental results are supportive evidence of the presence of antibodies and exposure
to Borrelia burgdorferi and may be used along with patient history, symptoms and other
laboratory data to support a clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease.
Negative results by the LIAISON Lyme IgG assay should not be used to exclude Lyme disease.
The test must be performed on the LIAISON XL Analyzer.
LIAISON Lyme IgG Control Set
The LIAISON Lyme IgG Control Set is intended for use as assayed quality control samples to
monitor the performance of the LIAISON Lyme IgG assay. The performance characteristics of
LIAISON Lyme IgG controls have not been established for any other assays or instrument
platforms different from the LIAISON XL.
LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus
The LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus assay uses chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA)
technology for the qualitative determination of lgG and IgM antibodies of Borrelia burgdorferi in
human serum and plasma (K2-EDTA, Li-heparin) samples. This assay is intended for use on
samples from patients with signs and symptoms that are consistent with Lyme disease.
K202574 - Page 2 of 24

--- Page 3 ---
Positive or equivocal results with the LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus should be confirmed
with additional testing by one of the following methodologies:
a). Standard two-tier test (STTT) methodology using an IgG and/or IgM Western blot test for
Borrelia burgdorferi.
or -
b). Modified two-tier test (MTTT) methodology using one or more of the following LIAISON
assays: LIAISON Lyme IgM and/or LIAISON Lyme IgG
Positive supplemental results either by the STTT or MTTT are supportive evidence of the
presence of antibodies and of exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi and may be used along with
patient history, symptoms and other laboratory data to support a clinical diagnosis of Lyme
disease.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
LIAISON XL Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The LIAISON Lyme IgG assay is an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for the
qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum and plasma
samples. All assay steps (with the exception of magnetic particle resuspension) and incubations
are performed by the Analyzer. The principal components of the test are magnetic particles (solid
phase) coated with recombinant Borrelia antigens and a conjugate reagent containing an anti-
human IgG mouse monoclonal antibody linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody
conjugate). During the first incubation, anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies present in
calibrators, samples or controls bind to the solid phase. Unbound material is then removed with a
wash cycle. During the second incubation, the antibody conjugate reacts with anti-Borrelia
burgdorferi IgG antibodies that have bound to the solid phase. Excess antibody conjugate is then
removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash
chemiluminescence reaction is induced. The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-
antibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is
indicative of the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi IgG antibodies present in calibrators, samples
or controls.
B Principle of Operation:
Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA)
C Instrument Description Information:
K202574 - Page 3 of 24

--- Page 4 ---
1. Instrument Name:
LIAISON XL Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by barcode and each test parameter is identified via information
encoded in the Reagent Integral Radio Frequency Identification transponder (RFID Tag).
Control identification is detected by the bar code label or may be manually programmed into
the instrument. Follow the analyzer operator’s manual to start the run. Return controls to the
refrigerator immediately after each use.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Either human serum, SST serum, K2-EDTA plasma and Lithium Heparin plasma may be
used in this assay. Blood should be collected aseptically by venipuncture. Serum samples
should be allowed to clot. Centrifuge samples and separate serum or plasma from the clot as
soon as possible. Samples having particulate matter, turbidity, lipemia, or erythrocyte debris
may require clarification by filtration or centrifugation before testing. Grossly hemolyzed or
lipemic samples as well as samples containing particulate matter or exhibiting obvious
microbial contamination should not be tested. Check for and remove air bubbles before
assaying. Samples are stable at room temperature for up to three days. If the assay is
performed within 14 days of sample collection, the samples should be kept at 2-8°C;
otherwise they should be stored frozen (-20°C or below). If samples are stored frozen, mix
thawed samples well before testing. Samples may be frozen-thawed 5 times. Self-defrosting
freezers are not recommended for sample storage.
4. Calibration:
The DiaSorin LIAISON Lyme IgG assay generates a continuous response (relative light
units, RLU) which is used in sample grading to provide a qualitative (positive, negative, or
equivocal) reportable result. The sample grading is based on the use of a calibration curve
referenced to an ‘In-house’ anti-Lyme IgG reference standard curve (Master Curve) and is
controlled by the use of two calibrators (Calibrator 1 and Calibrator 2) provided in the
Reagent Integral.
Calibration is required every 8 weeks, or whenever one of the following conditions occurs:
• If Quality Control results are out of the acceptable range
• With each new lot of reagents (Reagent Integral or Starter Reagents)
• After each servicing of the LIAISON XL Analyzer
K202574 - Page 4 of 24

--- Page 5 ---
The assay measuring range is 0.01 to 45.0 Index value. Samples that read lower than the
measuring curve are reported as < 0.01 Index, and samples that read above the measuring
curve are reported as > 45.0 Index.
5. Quality Control:
Quality control is required to be performed once per day of use, or according to the
guidelines or requirements of local regulations or accredited organizations. It is
recommended that the user refer to CLSI C24-A3 and 42 CFR 493.1256 (c) for guidance on
appropriate quality control practices.
LIAISON Lyme IgG controls are intended to monitor for substantial reagent failure. Single
replicates of LIAISON controls should be run to monitor the assay performance. If control
values lie within the expected ranges provided on the certificate of analysis, the test is valid.
If control values lie outside the expected ranges, the test is invalid and patient results cannot
be reported. Assay calibration should be performed if a control failure is observed and
controls and patient specimens must be repeated.
The performance of other controls should be evaluated for compatibility with this assay
before they are used. Appropriate value ranges should be established for all quality control
materials used.
The range of concentrations of each control is reported on the certificate of analysis and
indicates the limits established by DiaSorin for control values that can be obtained in reliable
assay runs.

Class Specificity Study: Dithiothreitol (DTT) was used to specifically inactivate IgM
antibodies without affecting IgG antibodies. Five Borrelia burgdorferi positive specimens
containing various levels of IgG antibodies and known to be IgM positive by Western blot
were used for this testing. Samples were divided into two aliquots: one aliquot was spiked
with DTT to a final concentration of 10 mM and the second aliquot was spiked with the same
volume of vehicle control. Results are summarized in the table below.

Freeze-thaw Study
A study was performed using six samples for each of the following sample types: serum (no
preservative), Serum-Separating Tube (SST) serum, EDTA plasma and lithium heparin
plasma. Each sample type includes neat or contrived serum samples spiked to the following
levels: one negative, two high negative, two low positive, and one moderate positive.
Samples were aliquoted, frozen and thawed for up to six freeze/thaw cycles before being
tested in duplicate in the same assay.

Regression of the mean percent difference versus freeze thaw counts does not cross ±10% for
any of the sample types tested and thus demonstrate the stability of all claimed specimen
types over the sponsor’s stability claim of five freeze-thaw cycles.
Room Temperature Stability
Another stability study was performed to demonstrate analyte stability when stored at room
temperature. Six samples containing the same analyte levels as described above were
aliquoted and stored at 22°C for the indicated times prior to testing. Samples were tested in
duplicate at the following time points: 0, 4, 8, 9, 24, 25, 48, 49, 72, 73, 168 and169 hours.
Data is summarized in the table below.

No significant trend over a period of 169 hours was observed and the mean percent
difference versus time does not cross ±10% over the course of the study. These data are
sufficient to support the sponsor’s recommended storage claim of three days at room
temperature.
An additional specimen stability study was performed to assess stability of samples when
stored at 4°C. Six samples containing the same analyte levels as described above were
aliquoted and stored at 22°C for the indicated times prior to testing. Samples were tested in
duplicate at the following time points: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 14 and 15 days. Data is summarized in the

The regression of mean percent difference versus time does not cross +10% for any of the sample
types tested. These data support stability of all claimed specimen types over a period of 14
days when stored at 4°C.
Finally, sample stability was also assessed when stored at -20°C. Six samples containing the
same analyte levels as described above were aliquoted and stored at 22°C for the indicated
times prior to testing. Samples were tested in duplicate at designated intervals of 1, 2, 3, 6, 7,
9, 10, 12 and 13 months. Results for up to three months have been obtained, additional testing
is currently ongoing. Available data is summarized in the table below.

6. Detection Limit:
Not Applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The cut-off for the LIAISON Lyme IgG Assay was determined by evaluating U.S. sourced
characterized samples from Lyme disease patients and routine clinical samples sent to the
laboratory for Lyme disease serology testing. Based on available clinical and laboratory data
and by comparison with other cleared serology assays, the samples were classified as
expected positive or negative for B. burgdorferi antibodies and evaluated with the LIAISON
Lyme IgG assay. A cut-off index of 1.0 was determined to provide the best balance of
sensitivity and specificity. An equivocal zone of 0.90-1.10 was applied to the assay to
account for normal measurement imprecision.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Prospective Cohort Testing: A total of 2,643 human serum specimens were obtained from
four approved commercial vendors. The specimens were collected from non-selected
subjects sent to the lab for Lyme disease testing in 14 states which represented five distinct
geographical regions. Twenty-two (22) samples did not have enough volume to complete all
testing. A total of 2,621 samples were evaluated of which 44.1% were male, 55.7% were
female, and 0.2% did not have a gender reported.
Samples were tested with the LIAISON Lyme IgG assay on the LIAISON XL instrument at
three laboratories (two external and one internal at DiaSorin). Results were evaluated for
first-tier testing and compared to the predicate device.

*Includes Positive and Equivocal results combined
Western blot testing was performed on samples positive or equivocal by the test device and
the predicate. The following results were obtained:

Despite a larger number of initially positive specimens on the predicate device, both the
predicate and the LIAISON Lyme IgG test yielded the same number of samples positive by
second tier western blot testing. Furthermore, of the 135 specimens positive by the predicate
device and negative by the LIAISON Lyme IgG test (Table 11), 123 (91.1%) were negative
by second tier western blot.
Performance agreement of the Lyme IgG assay when utilized as a first-tier test in a standard
two-tiered testing algorithm (STTT) is summarized below and compared to results for the
predicate assay.

a All 12 discordant samples were negative when evaluated by another FDA cleared immunoblot assay
b 3/12 discordant samples were positive when evaluated by another FDA cleared immunoblot assay
Second-Tier Tier Positive % Agreement: 89.0% (97/109) 95% CI: 81.7-93.6%
Second-Tier Negative % Agreement: 99.5% (2500/2512) 95% CI: 99.2-99.7%
Cumulatively, these data support equivalence of the LIAISON Lyme IgG test to the predicate
device as a first-tier test for Lyme disease.
Performance of the LIAISON Lyme IgG was also evaluated when utilized as a second-tier
test as part of a Modified Two-tiered Testing (MTTT) algorithm. Specifically, the 2621
prospective specimens were tested initially with the cleared assay, LIAISON Lyme Total
Antibody Plus. Positive or equivocal results on the LIAISON Lyme Total Antibody Plus
were subsequently evaluated by the LIAISON Lyme IgG assay with positive or equivocal
results considered MTTT positive. Agreement of the MTTT algorithm was also assessed
against use of the cleared chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) LIAISON Lyme Total
Antibody Plus followed by a cleared western blot test as part of an STTT protocol. These
schemes are summarized below.

Retrospective Cohort Testing: A retrospective cohort was also evaluated that consisted of
280 panel members obtained from CDC. The retrospective panel contained 90 specimens
from patients known to have Lyme disease, 90 specimens from patients with diseases other
than Lyme disease, and 50 specimens each from healthy controls in both endemic and non-
endemic regions.

The CDC Lyme panel was tested internally at DiaSorin on the LIAISON Lyme IgG assay
and the predicated device (ZEUS ELISA B. burgdorferi IgG assay). No repeat testing of
equivocal samples was performed on the ZEUS IgG assay due to limited sample volume. No
western blots were performed on any of the positive or equivocal results. Summary of
agreement is included in the table below.

b Of the 2 negative discordant specimens, both were Early Lyme-EM, both were CDC 2-tier IgG negative
c Of the 3 discordant healthy controls, 2 were non-endemic controls and 1 was an endemic
negative control
d The 9 discordant look-alike diseases were the following specimens: 4 Syphilis, 2
Mononucleosis, 1 Periodontis, 1 Rheumatoid arthritis, and 1 Fibromyalgia
These results establish that LIAISON Lyme IgG assay performance is equivalent to the
predicate ZEUS B. Burgdorferi IgG test for the pre-determined CDC Reference Panel cohort
classifications.
Performance of the Lyme IgG assay was also evaluated against the same specimens when
utilized as a second-tier test as part of a MTTT algorithm. The STTT and MTTT testing
algorithms utilized for this study are the same as identified above in Figures 1 and 2. Results
from this comparison are summarized in the below table. One sample from the endemic
negative control group did not have sufficient volume for testing; therefore, a total of 279
retrospective samples were evaluated.

Based on the above results, use of the LIAISON Lyme IgG assay as a second-tier test,
successfully detects a greater proportion of early Lyme disease cases. Use of the LIAISON
Lyme IgG assay is therefore considered acceptable for use with the LIAISON Lyme Total
Antibody Plus assay following the Modified Two-Tiered Testing Methodology.
Analytical Specificity: The LIAISON Lyme IgG assay was used to test 300 samples from
apparently healthy individuals in the U.S. This population was 57.3% female, 42.7% male
with a mean age of 50 years. Fifty percent of the samples were collected in a Lyme disease
endemic region and 50% were collected from a Lyme disease non-endemic region.

Population N % Positivity
Endemic 150 6.7% (10/150)
Non-endemic 150 1.3% (2/150)

2. Matrix Comparison:
Matrix Equivalency Study: Thirty-two (32) matched patient sets of serum, SST serum, K2-
EDTA plasma and lithium heparin plasma samples were tested to determine if these sample
types provide equivalent results. Sample regression analysis was done by Passing & Bablok
regression. All sample types met acceptance criteria for use in the LIAISON Lyme IgG
assay. A summary of the results are shown in the following table.

Internal and external investigators assessed the device’s performance with 2,621 masked
specimens prospectively collected from patients between the ages of 2-103 that were submitted
for Borrelia antibody testing. Specimens were acquired from five distinct geographical regions
within the U.S. The specimens were randomly distributed among three testing sites, one of which
was the manufacturer’s research facility for testing. The device’s performance was also assessed
at the manufacturer’s research facility with specimens from an asymptomatic population
obtained from both endemic and non-endemic regions. Available subject demographics, quantity
of specimens tested and number of specimens which tested positive or equivocal for each
population are summarized in Table 19.
