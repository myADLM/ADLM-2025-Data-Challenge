B Indication(s) for Use:
The Acetaminophen assay is used for the quantitative determination of acetaminophen in human
serum or plasma on the ARCHITECT c Systems.
The Acetaminophen assay is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of
acetaminophen overdose toxicity.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
ARCHITECT c8000 analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The assay consists of two reagents:
Reagent 1 (Enzyme Reagent) 8.6 mL
Active Ingredients: manganese (II) chloride (0.3 mmol/L), aryl acylamidase (0.9 KU/L).
Preservatives: gentamicin sulfate, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, sodium azide.
Reagent 2 (Color Reagent) 22.3 mL
Active ingredient: 2,5-dimethylphenol (31 mmol/L).
B Principle of Operation:
The Acetaminophen assay is an automated clinical chemistry assay. In the reaction, aryl
acylamidase is the enzyme that hydrolyzes acetaminophen to p-aminophenol and acetate. Next,
p-aminophenol reacts with 2,5-dimethylphenol in the presence of a manganese catalyst to create
the chromophore, 4-(4-iminophenol)-2,5- dimethylcyclohexadiene-1-one. Generation of this
reaction product is measured at 660 nm and its production is proportional to the concentration of
acetaminophen in the patient sample.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor provided a within-laboratory precision study using one ARCHITECT c8000
analyzer, two reagent lots, two calibrator lots, and one control lot.
The samples included control materials, serum pools spiked with acetaminophen, and pooled
serum samples. Samples were tested in a minimum of 2 replicates (target of 3 replicates, 2
times per day separated by a minimum of 2 hours), on at least 20 different days, for a
minimum of 80 required measurements. Results are summarized in the table below.

2. Linearity:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the linearity of the candidate assay on the
ARCHITECT c8000 by referencing the CLSI EP06-Ed2 guideline. A linearity series of 11
samples was prepared by making admixtures of a sample of known high concentration with
an acetaminophen-free normal human serum. The evaluation samples had concentrations of
2, 5, 46, 91, 138, 182, 226, 276, 315, 364, and 394 µg/mL.

The maximum deviation from linearity was 1 μg/mL for samples with acetaminophen
concentrations less than 20 μg/mL and the maximum % deviation from linearity ranged from
-0.9% to 0.8% for samples with acetaminophen concentrations greater than or equal to 20
μg/mL
Linear regression of the data produced the following:
Slope 0.9916
Intercept 0.1964
Correlation Coefficient 0.999
The results of the linearity studies support the sponsor’s claimed measuring interval of 3 –
377 µg/mL. Samples with a concentration greater than 377 µg/mL will be reported as > 377
µg/mL without dilution.
The sponsor also performed a study to evaluate the accuracy of the auto-dilute feature for
samples with a concentration greater than 377 µg/mL. Five samples with acetaminophen
concentrations within the range of 450 μg/mL to 3,000 μg/mL were prepared by spiking USP
Reference Standard Acetaminophen Stock solution into five human serum specimens which
had acetaminophen levels of 0 μg/mL as screened by a commercially available assay. The
acetaminophen concentration of each sample was assigned using the mean concentration of
ten replicates tested by a commercially available assay. Each sample was either manually or
automatically diluted at a 1:10 dilution. The results of the study demonstrated that the
dilution recoveries for the auto dilute feature were all within +/- 2% of the expected value.
The dilution study results support the sponsor’s labeling claims that samples with
acetaminophen concentrations above 377 µg/mL may be diluted 1:10 either manually or on-
onboard the analyzer to obtain results up to 3770 µg/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate potential interference from endogenous and
exogenous compounds. The study used one ARCHITECT c8000 analyzer, one reagent lot,
one calibrator lot, and one control lot.
Each potential interferent was tested at acetaminophen concentrations of approximately 5,
30, and 150 µg/mL.
The sponsor defined significant interference as ± ≤ 7.5% interference for acetaminophen
samples ≥ 20 μg/mL or ± ≤ 1.50 μg/mL interference for acetaminophen samples < 20 μg/mL.
By these criteria, no interference was observed at the following concentrations:
Potential Endogenous Interferents
Potential Interferent Interferent Concentration
Bilirubin – conjugated 14 mg/dL
Bilirubin – unconjugated 28 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 570 mg/dL
Intralipid 2000 mg/dL

when the automatic x 10 dilution factor is applied. Samples with an acetaminophen
concentration less than 3 µg/mL are reported as “< 3 µg/mL”.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The Acetaminophen Calibrator is prepared gravimetrically from USP grade reference
acetaminophen material to a concentration of 151 μg/mL (1000 μmol/L). The calibrator
preparation is verified against the master calibrator (an internal reference standard).
6. Detection Limit:
The sponsor performed studies in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 guideline to determine the
limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of the
candidate device. Two lots of reagent were evaluated on the ARCHITECT c8000 analyzer.
The testing was performed using one zero-analyte sample (normal human serum) and ten
low-level samples (2 samples at each of the 5 acetaminophen target concentrations of
approximately 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 μg/mL). The low-level samples were prepared by
volumetrically spiking acetaminophen stock solution into normal human serum. A total of
60 replicates were collected per concentration per reagent lot.
The results of the studies supported the following detection limit claims:
μg/mL
LoB 0.0
LoD 1.0
LoQ 3.0
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not Applicable
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The sponsor performed a method comparison study comparing results from the candidate
device to those from the predicate device. A total of 119 human serum specimens were
evaluated with the predicate and candidate devices. The concentration range evaluated was
3.5 – 356.3 µg/mL by the predicate device.
Contrived samples made up 4% of the total and were prepared by spiking serum specimens
with a stock solution of acetaminophen material to the desired concentration range. The
contrived samples were spiked to acetaminophen concentrations at the upper end of the
measuring range where it is difficult to obtain unaltered clinical samples.
For the candidate method, one ARCHITECT c8000 analyzer, two reagent lots, two calibrator
lots, and one control lot were used. For the predicate method, one ARCHITECT c8000
analyzer, two reagent lots, two calibrator lots, and one control lot were used.

A Passing-Bablok linear regression model was performed by comparing the first replicate
result from the investigational method versus the mean result from the comparator method.
Linear regression statistics from a representative lot were as follows:
Predicate Method vs Candidate Method
Correlation Coefficient 0.9993
Slope 1.042
Intercept -0.034
2. Matrix Comparison:
The sponsor performed a matrix comparison study to verify which specimen tube types
(matrices) may be used with the assay. A total of 78 samples were analyzed. Of those 78
samples, 45 native samples covered the claimed therapeutic range of 10-30 μg/mL and 18
samples were spiked to cover the assay reportable range.
The data was collected using Serum (with gel in plastic, Serum Separator Tube), Lithium
heparin (with gel in plastic, Plasma Separator Tube), Lithium heparin (without gel in plastic),
and Sodium heparin (without gel in plastic) vs serum (without gel in plastic) as the
comparator matrix. All percent recoveries were within ± 10%.
Linear regression produced the following:

assay and has claimed them as sample types in the labeling:
Plain serum

Lithium heparin tube (without gel in plastic)
Sodium heparin tube (without gel in plastic)
