B Indication(s) for Use:
DiviTumTKa is an in vitro diagnostic device intended for the semi-quantitative measurement of
thymidine kinase activity (TKa) in human serum. The assay is to be used as an aid in monitoring
disease progression in previously diagnosed hormone receptor positive, metastatic
postmenopausal female breast cancer patients. A TKa value of < 250 DuA is associated with the
decreased likelihood of disease progression within 30 days or 60 days post testing. DiviTumTKa
results should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods for monitoring breast cancer.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
WARNINGS:
• DiviTumTKa should not be used for cancer screening or diagnosis.
• DiviTumTKa is not for serial testing because the test result at given timepoint does not
compare to the test result at previous timepoint, but to a fixed cut-off value
• DiviTumTKa is not indicated as a standalone test to determine the outcome of disease, nor to
suggest or infer an individual patient’s likely benefit from therapy.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
ELISA microplate reader capable of measuring optical density (OD) at 405 nm and 630 nm
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Reagents
DiviTumTKa kit contains reagents to test 37 patient samples in duplicates. Each kit is stored at
4–8 °C and contains the following:
• Reaction Plate DiviTumTKa: one 96 well plate in sealed aluminum foil, contains
immobilized DNA strands, acts as reaction chamber
• Reagent A: one vial, lyophilized, contains 0.04% sodium azide as preservative and
necessary enzymes for the enzyme reaction
• Reagent B: one vial, lyophilized, contains the substrate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
• Antibody-Enzyme Conjugate: one vial, lyophilized, contains 0.05% sodium azide as
preservative
• Substrate: one tablet for reaction with the enzyme in Antibody-Enzyme Conjugate
• Buffer: four vials [one vial each of Conjugate Buffer (12.5 mL liquid), Substrate Buffer
(13.5 mL liquid), Reaction Buffer (46.5 mL liquid) and Wash Buffer (13.0 mL liquid)],
contains sodium azide as preservative
• Calibrator: seven vials (level 0 to 6), lyophilized, with pre-determined value for
generating calibration curve, contains human serum
K202852 - Page 2 of 18

--- Page 3 ---
• Control: three vials (Low, Medium and High), lyophilized, contains human serum, with
pre-determined value, for assay run quality control
B Principle of Operation:
The DiviTumTKa is a multi-step end-point ELISA assay involving a cascade of enzymatic
reactions and one antibody binding reaction. In the DiviTumTKa test, a serum sample is
combined with a reaction mixture containing the substrate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Since
BrdU is a substrate analog to thymidine, TK from the serum sample phosphorylates the BrdU to
its monophosphate, BrdUMP. The BrdUMP is then further phosphorylated to its triphosphate,
BrdUTP and incorporated into a DNA/RNA hybrid, bound to the 96-well microplate solid
surface using a reverse transcriptase DNA polymerase. An alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-
BrdU antibody is added to the reaction product after washing. The amount of phosphatase
conjugate bound to the DNA is determined by a colorimetric reaction, turning the substrate color
from colorless to yellow, and the absorbance reading at 405 nm and 630 nm are used to calculate
the TK-activity level in the sample. Calibrators with pre-determined nominal TKa values are
included in the kit. These are used to generate a standard curve by which the optical density
(OD) readings from the patient samples are converted to TK activity expressed as DiviTum Units
of Activity (DuA).

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI guideline EP05-A3.
a) Within-laboratory Precision:
The studies were performed at a single site using one lot of DiviTumTKa kit reagents.
Six levels of native serum sample were run in two replicates per run, two runs daily over
the course of 20 days (2 x 2 x 20, n =80 for each sample). The data were analyzed for
repeatability (within-run), between-run, between-day, and within-laboratory precision.
The mean DuA and percent coefficient of variation (%CV) are summarized in table
below.

dataset for sample 2 was 16.2%.
b) Lot-to-Lot Precision:
The study was performed at a single site using three different lots of DiviTumTKa kit
reagents. Seven levels of native serum sample were run in five replicates per run, one run
per day for five days (3 x 5 x 5, n=75 for each sample). The data were analyzed for the

c) Site-to-Site Reproducibility:
The study was performed at three sites (including one internal site and two external sites)
using single lot of DiviTumTKa kit reagents. Five levels of native serum sample were run
in five replicates per run, one run daily over the course of five days (3 x 1 x 5 x 5, n=75
for each sample). The combined results with the factors of site and run used to calculate
the repeatability (within-run), between-run, between-site and reproducibility are
summarized in table below:

*One outlier was removed. The ‘reproducibility’ results (%CV) including the outlier found in the dataset
for sample 5 was 14.5%.
2. Linearity:
a) Linearity studies:
Linearity studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI guideline EP06, 2nd Edition. A
‘high sample pool’ and a ‘low sample pool’ were prepared using native serum samples.
The ‘high sample pool’ had a DuA value (as measured by DiviTumTKa) higher than the
‘upper limit of the linearity interval’ (ULLI). The ‘low sample pool’ had a DuA value
lower than the ‘lower limit of the linearity interval’ (LLLI). The two sample pools were
mixed to obtain 10 intermediate concentrations with TK activity distributed throughout
the ‘analytical measuring interval’ (AMI) and near the assay clinical decision point, 250
DuA. The final linearity sample panel consisted of 12 samples. The samples were tested
with DiviTumTKa in replicates of four and all members of a sample set were run
together. Measured values were plotted on the vertical (y-) axis and the expected values

The results support the linearity of the claimed DiviTumTKa ‘analytical measuring
interval’ (AMI) of 100 DuA to 2,000 DuA.
b) Spiking and Dilutional Recovery Studies:
Dilutional recovery studies were conducted using two independent patient serum sample
panels (Sample panel A and B) which were generated by pooling sera from cancer
patients with high levels of endogenous TK activity, and one sample panel (Sample panel
C) which was generated by diluting a known amounts of recombinant TK1 protein in
pooled human serum with very low endogenous TK activity. The initial TK activity in all
three sample panels were above the ULOQ of the assay (~2000 DuA). Five two-fold
serial-dilutions were prepared right before assaying each sample panel using
DiviTumTKa kit component reaction buffer as diluent. The TK activity in three dilution
panels were independently determined in duplicates by two operators on individual days
using DiviTumTKa assays. The dilution adjusted TK activity calculated for each sample
and the % recovery of measured TK activity and target (expected) TK activity is
presented in the table below.

c) High Dose Hook Effect:
Hook effect of the DiviTumTKa was evaluated in accordance with CLSI guideline EP34.
Human serum samples with low TK activity were pooled and then spiked with high
concentrations of recombinant TK to approximately 100,000 DuA (about 50 times higher
than the ULOQ). The sample was serially diluted seven times to create samples with TK
activity of approximately 50000, 25000, 12500, 6250, 3125, 1563 and 781 DuA and
tested in six replicates using a single reagent lot DiviTumTKa. No high dose hook effect
was observed when samples were up to approximately 100,000 DuA of DiviTumTKa.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07 (3rd Edition) and EP37 (1st
Edition) guidelines to determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances
on the DiviTumTKa assay. Two native human serum pools with a target concentration of
100–174 DuA (Low pool) and 328–435 DuA (High pool) were supplemented with
potentially interfering compounds, and the percent bias was determined by comparing the
result of sample with interferent to a control sample without the interferent. An interference
within ± 15% bias between the mean spiked sample value and the mean control value was
considered non-significant.
a) Endogenous Substance Interference:
The following endogenous substances were tested using DiviTumTKa assay. No
significant interference was found for each substance at the concentrations listed below.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability:
There is no recognized standard for Thymidine Kinase Activity (TKa). Calibration of the
DiviTumTKa is traceable to in-house reference calibrators (Master calibrators), whose
TKa values have been assigned, in accordance with ISO 17511 (2nd Edition), according to
the protein concentration used in each calibrator: 1 DuA (DiviTum unit of Activity) is the
TKa of 1 pg/mL of standard recombinant TK1.
b) Kit Stability:
The shelf-life of the DiviTumTKa reagent kit was determined according to CLSI
guideline EP25-A.
i) Reagent kit stability: A real-time stability study at ‒24 ±6ºC and +2 to +8°C was
performed using three DiviTumTKa kit lots. Three samples with TKa levels within
the AMI (near LLOQ, medical decision point and high) were tested in six replicates
per sample, in three assay runs. Testing was performed at multiple time points
throughout the claimed stability period and at least one month past the expiration
date. Results support the 12-month shelf-life stability claim for the DiviTumTKa
reagent kit at ‒24 ±6ºC and +2 to +8°C.
ii) Transport simulation: To evaluate reagent transport stability, three DiviTumTKa kit
lot reagents were stored at -24 ±6°C until transport simulation started. When initiating
the transport simulation, the kits were stored at room temperature (RT) for 24 hours.
Thereafter, the kits were placed in the freezer until all liquid had become frozen (3–4
hours). The kits were then placed in RT again for 96 hours. Thereafter, the kits were
placed in 2°C to 8°C and stored there until analysis was performed at respective
testing occasion. The results from the combined ‘transport simulation’ and stability
study at 2°C to 8°C show that DiviTumTKa is stable at least for 12 months in 2°C to
8°C after transport.
c) Sample Stability:
To demonstrate that serum samples stored at -70°C (with no freeze/thaw cycles) and
those used in the clinical study have acceptable levels of Thymidine kinase activity
(TKa), an accelerated stability study was conducted for 21 days at four elevated
temperatures. Three pools of serum from breast cancer patients were aliquoted and stored
at -70°C until moved to four different elevated temperatures (4°C, 25°C, 30°C, and 37°C)
for up to 3 weeks. The degradation and estimated shelf-life were calculated for both
storage temperature -20°C and -70°C using the Arrhenius equation. The results obtained
with the Arrhenius calculation indicated that no relevant degradation would occur for
samples stored at -70°C for 15 years and for samples stored at -20°C for 6 years.

6. Detection Capability:
CLSI guideline EP17-A2 were followed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of
Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the DiviTumTKa.
LoB: Four blank samples were obtained by affinity purification of healthy blood donor
serum. The samples were tested in replicates of six over the course of five days using two
DiviTum TKa reagent lots (Lot A and Lot B; 120 replicates for each lot). The LoB was
calculated using the non-parametric option. This gave the LoB value 32.5 DuA for Lot A and
33.3 DuA for Lot B. The claimed LoB for the DiviTumTKa is 33.3 DuA.
LoD: Four low-level samples derived from breast cancer patient serum were run in replicates
of six over the course of five days using two DiviTum TKa reagent lots (Lot A and Lot B;
120 replicates for each lot). The parametric analysis was used as 120 measurement results
from four LoD samples followed normal distribution in each group with no outliers being
observed. LoD was defined as the lowest TK-activity that can be determined with a 95%
confidence of being higher than LoB. This gave the LoD value 47.0 DuA for Lot A and 46.8
DuA for Lot B. The claimed LoD for the DiviTumTka is 47.0 DuA.
LoQ: A precision profile was created using nine native low TK activity serum samples using
one lot of DiviTumTKa kit reagents. A within-laboratory precision study of 80
measurements (20 days x 2 runs x 2 replicates) was performed as described in CLSI EP05-
A3. Within-laboratory %CV was plotted against DuA and a power function was fitted to the
data. The estimated LoQ of DiviTumTKa was 80 DuA using the precision profile power
function, with a CV criterion of 15%. The lowest measurand concentration that can be
measured with respect to predefined accuracy goals was set to 100 DuA. The claimed LoQ
for the DiviTumTKa is 100.0 DuA.

2. Matrix Comparison:
Not applicable. The assay is for serum samples only.
C Clinical Studies:
The effectiveness of the DiviTumTKa as an aid in monitoring disease progression in
postmenopausal female patients previously diagnosed with HR+ metastatic breast cancer and
undergoing treatment, was determined through a clinical validation study using banked serum
samples from metastatic breast cancer patients undergoing treatment. The primary objective was
K202852 - Page 12 of 18

--- Page 13 ---
to evaluate whether Thymidine Kinase activity (TKa) above a preset value (clinical cut-off) at
TKa ≥ 250 DuA in patient’s serum sample during treatment at cycles 2, 3, 4, 7 is prognostic for
progression of metastatic breast cancer.

Non-progression was assumed for all sample collections (with TKa measurements) unless
progression was confirmed by RECIST criteria. (RECIST v.1.0). Death was counted as
progression.
Serum samples from 454 patients were collected by several different clinical facilities in the U.S.
and Canada. The serum samples were shipped on dry ice to a biobank where they were stored at
-80°C until analysis. The samples were de-identified prior to being shipped to Biovica. A total of
1,726 serum samples were analyzed in replicates. Out of these, 118 observations (samples) were
excluded due to missing values for “actual time of visit”, 10 TKa results (samples) were
excluded due to insufficient serum for analyses or invalid (due to imprecise on of the replicates
in the test results) and 52 samples were obtained after the patient had progressed. The 52 serum
samples were distributed over the 454 patients. The final analysis contained 1546 test results
(samples representing 454 patients), of which 382 samples were collected at baseline (actual time
baseline) and 1164 samples were collected during cycles 2, 3, 4, and 7. The 454 patients included
in the study showed age distribution (years) of 65±10.3 (Mean), 64 (Median), 58 (Q1), 72 (Q3),
27 (minimum) and 92 (maximum).

In summary, the clinical study results support the intended use of DiviTumTKa as “an aid in
monitoring disease progression in previously diagnosed postmenopausal HR+ metastatic breast
cancer patients undergoing treatment.” NPV for progression within 30 days or 60 days exceeded
90% for all time points analyzed, thereby supporting intended use statement “a TKa value of <
250 DuA is associated with the decreased likelihood of disease progression within 30 days or 60
days post testing.”

D Clinical Cut-Off:
The TKa clinical cut-off value was determined by analyzing serum samples from 123 apparently
healthy post-menopausal female and based on the 95th percentile of that distribution in the
‘Reference Range study.’ The test is used for monitoring but would not be characterized as serial
testing because the test result at given timepoint does not compare to the test result at previous
timepoint, but to a fixed cut-off value.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
a) Reference range:
The reference range of the DiviTum TKa was established per CLSI EP28-A3c. Serum
specimens from 123 apparently healthy post-menopausal female subjects (age ≥ 55 and < 85,
collected in the U.S.) were assessed using the DiviTum TKa. The results are presented in the
table below:
N = 123
TKa (DuA)
Mean 139
Standard Deviation 56
Median 125
Max 301
95th percentile 254
97.5th percentile 276
b) Expected value:
In addition to the normal cohort, serum specimens obtained from postmenopausal female
subjects with benign conditions and postmenopausal female subjects with malignant diseases
were tested using the DiviTum TKa. The observed ranges are summarized in the following
tables:
