B Principle of Operation:
The Eonis SCID-SMA kit is a multiplex real-time PCR based assay that uses target sequence-
specific primers and TaqMan™ probes to amplify and detect TREC, KREC, and RPP30 in DNA
extracted from newborn dried blood spot (DBS) using the Eonis DNA Extraction kit in a single
PCR reaction. Each TaqMan probe has a unique dye linked to their terminal 5’ end, allowing for
the simultaneous detection of the four targets, if present. The amount of each target present in the
DNA is determined by the intensity of fluorescence emitted by each dye released from the
degraded probe during amplification and detected by the QuantStudio Dx Real-Time PCR
instrument. The instrument measures fluorescence signals and converts them into comparative
quantitative readouts which are expressed as a function of cycle threshold (Ct) values. RPP30 is
used as an internal amplification control for DNA quality and to relatively quantitate TREC and
KREC (copies/105 cells) using TREC ∆Ct and KREC ∆Ct. TREC and KREC concentrations are
calculated using the following formulas to generate results expressed as copies/105 cells:
• TREC: 2 X 2-(ΔCt TREC) x 117000
• KREC: 2 X 2-(ΔCt TREC) x 254000
The interpretation of results based on copy number is shown in Tables 2 and 3.

C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
QuantStudio Dx Real-Time PCR instrument (The information below is specific to the TREC
and KREC analytes; refer to the decision summary for additional information regarding the
features in this section K123955)
JANUS G3 Automated Workstation (for IVD use) consisting of the JANUS Extraction
Instrument and JANUS PCR Mastermix Instrument
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are barcoded and entered into the testing queue consistent with the laboratory
procedures.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The required sample is a 3.2 mm specimen punch from a dried blood spot (DBS) into a 96-
well plate. DNA is extracted and purified using the Eonis DNA Extraction kit. The extraction
can be completed manually or using an automated liquid handling platform, the JANUS G3
Workstation (IVD), for processing up to four 96-well plates simultaneously.
4. Calibration:
The device (Eonis SCID-SMA kit) calibrates the TREC results utilizing the internal control
RPP30 gene (assumes two copies) and a mathematical algorithm and reports out the results in
the unit of copies/105 cells.
5. Quality Control:
Quality control is addressed for each separately cleared specific assay to be run on the
instrument. For the Eonis SCID-SMA assay, quality is maintained by the process control,
used during sample processing and amplification in the assay. Additionally, there are external
positive and negative controls available that are used in accordance with the assay
instructions for use.
K203035 - Page 5 of 43

--- Page 6 ---
Controls are used throughout the entire procedure from sample preparation to PCR as a
quality check for performance of the Eonis test. The Eonis SCID-SMA kit contains three
multi-level dried blood spot controls: C1, C2 and C3. The DBS controls are filter paper
cassettes with each control level spotted in duplicate.
• C1 is an analyte-negative control and does not contain TREC, KRECanalytes.
• C2 and C3 are analyte-positive controls that have different levels of TREC and KREC
analytes (lower level in C2 and a higher level in C3).
• All three kit controls have the same level of RPP30 analyte.
• Blank reaction wells without sample disks (NTC [no template control]) are used to
monitor the absence of contamination. All controls are prepared from human whole blood
with a hematocrit value of 48-55% and contain purified salmon-sperm DNA and
synthetic TREC, KREC, and RPP30 plasmid DNA.
Each Eonis run includes all four controls in duplicate in each 96-well DNA extraction plate.
The newborn samples and DBS controls are punched into the plate, while the well reserved
for the Blank control does not contain any punches. The Blank control undergoes the whole
process, from DNA extraction to amplification, and the NTC sample consists of elution
solution derived from the DNA extraction process.
The test result validation for each 96-well DNA extraction plate is based on the three kit DBS
controls and the Blank reaction well. The Eonis Analysis software will identify each control
by their designated locations and check their validity. The possible outcome for each control
replicate is ‘Valid’ or ‘Invalid’. If one or more controls are invalid, the results of the clinical
specimens processed in the same 96-well DNA extraction plate are reported as ‘Invalid’. For
the Blank reaction well, both replicates must meet the acceptance criteria for the run to be
valid. For C1-C3 DBS controls, the results of both replicates must meet the acceptance
criteria for the run to be valid. The thresholds for valid controls are shown in Table 4.

The values in the mean TREC and KREC copies/105 cells column are transformed from
logarithmic (Ln) mean values, and therefore, they represent geometric means in the
copies/105 cells scale. The analysis of variance approach was used to calculate the results
presented as standard deviations (SDs) in the logarithmic (Ln) scale complemented with total
coefficient of variation (%CV) in lognormal scale (Table 6 and Table 8). Summary mean,
min and max copies/105 cells and SD and %CV results without log transformation for total
imprecision are shown in Table 7 and Table 9.
Acceptance Criteria:
• For TREC, the total assay precision within the measuring range must have a SD ≤ 0.9Ln
(copies/105 cells) where the measuring range starts at 250 copies/105 cells.
• For KREC, the total assay precision within the measuring range must have a SD ≤ 1.49
Ln (copies/105 cells).

Study 2: Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility
A study was performed internally (single site) using 3 sets of Eonis test systems, 2 operators,
and 3 kit lots. The 13 samples (Table 5) were tested over 23 calendar days with 2 replicates
per sample per plate in a total of 54 runs with a randomized plate map. The total number of
measurements was 108 per sample.
The values in the mean TREC and KREC copies/105 cells column are transformed from
logarithmic (Ln) mean values, and therefore, they represent geometric means in the
copies/105 cells scale. The analysis of variance approach was used to calculate the results
presented as SDs in the logarithmic (Ln) scale complemented with total %CVs in lognormal
scale (Table 10 and Table 12). Summary mean, min and max copies/105 cells, and SD and
%CV results without log transformation for total imprecision are shown in Table 11 and
Table 13.

All 84 plates from both studies had results of the Eonis SCID-SMA Kit Controls within the
acceptance limits. The data validity-check for each well resulted in a total of 15 out of 3354 well
exclusions from the analysis (sample invalid rate is 0.4%). The precision of the device control
kits is shown in Table 14a and the internal control RPP30 gene in Table 14b below.

Qualitative imprecision was determined in accordance with CLSI document EP12-A2 to
classify the results, using the screening performance study cut-offs (262 copies/105 cells for
TREC, 484 copies/105 cells for KREC). The C5-C95 interval was determined to be 79–626
copies/105 cells for TREC, and 189–1064 copies/105 cells for KREC. Concentrations outside
of these intervals were consistently analyte negative (concentrations <C5, equals to screen
positive) or consistently analyte positive (concentrations >C95, equals to screen negative).

2. Linearity:
Linearity was determined with 1 kit lot and 1 operator. Three (3) sets of contrived samples
were used for this evaluation and are described below. The samples were diluted to 9 levels
with 4 replicates for each level. Samples were punched at 4 replicates using a DBS puncher
and then transferred into a new 96-well plate in a randomized order and were extracted and
run using JANUS automated liquid handlers. Acceptance criteria were that all analytes,
TREC, KREC and RPP30, must have PCR efficiency between 80% and 120% with a
coefficient of determination, denoted R2 ≥ 95% within their measuring ranges. The
acceptance criteria for linearity for TREC and KREC concentrations were, on their
measuring ranges, the maximal difference of the best fitting model from the linear model
must be ± 25% (calculated in copies/105 cells).

The first set of samples were prepared by spiking leucocyte-depleted human red blood cells,
which had the hematocrit adjusted to 51.9, with linearized TREC and KREC plasmids and
cell lines covering the required measuring ranges (TREC: 52 to 7800 copies/μL blood;
KREC: 67 to 10,100 copies/μL blood; RPP30: 2670 to 400,000 copies/μL blood, per spiked
cell numbers), a semi-log linear regression line plot of Ct value vs. log of input nucleic acid
in the unit of copies/μL blood was first analyzed for each individual analyte (TREC, KREC
and RPP30) and the corresponding coefficient of determination (R2) of the linear regression
of the mean Ct values and PCR efficiency of each analyte were calculated. As shown in
Table 15, all 3 analytes had R2 > 99%, and their estimates of PCR efficiency were between
80% and 120%.
Table 15. Estimate of R2 and PCR efficiency of TREC, KREC and RPP30

95% CL 95% CL
TREC 0.993 83.9% 76.7% 92.6%
KREC 0.995 87.6% 81.2% 95.0%
RPP30 0.992 99.9% 89.9% 112.3%
Sample Set 2 and 3: Estimation of Linearity of the TREC and KREC Assay
Linearity was determined in accordance with CLSI document EP06-A2 and was designed to
evaluate the linearity of TREC and KREC in the unit of copies/105 cells calculated using ΔCt
TREC and ΔCt KREC for each dilution. A high concentration sample was prepared by
resuspending WBC (White Blood Cells) pellets concentrated from the 60 mL of human
umbilical cord bloods into 1mL if human umbilical cord blood to achieve TREC and KREC
Ct close to the lowest values (i.e., high concentrations) observed in a population of newborn
specimens (28.34. for TREC and 26.91 for KREC). Samples were then diluted with
leukocyte depleted whole blood into nine levels of serial dilutions down to a level close to
their LoQs (242 copies/105 cells for TREC and 459 copies/105 cells for KREC). In addition,
a third set of samples were created to provide additional information on the KREC linearity
at lower KREC concentrations because the second set did not cover the measuring range.
This low concentration sample set 3 was prepared by diluting umbilical cord blood with

leucocyte-depleted human red blood. HL-60 cells were spiked into the leucocyte-depleted
blood to adjust the RPP30 Ct values to match the RPP30 Ct value in cord blood. Using the
observed value for undiluted sample and the consecutive dilution factors, the expected values
at copies/105 cells scale were calculated. Linearity of TREC and KREC was then determined
by fitting regression of Ln Measured vs. Ln Expected value. Weights for regression fit were
calculated from the observed variability of each level. Using the obtained equation, the
predicted values at each dilution level and the deviations between measured and predicted
values were calculated. The descriptive statistics of each linearity sample level are presented
in Table 16 and Table 17. The data for KREC represents the combined datasets. The
measured results and fitted models are shown in Figure 1 and 3 the relative deviations in
Figures 2 and 4. For TREC, all points were within the study acceptance criteria of ±25%,
with highest relative deviation of -14.3%. For KREC, all points were within the study
acceptance criteria of ±25%, with highest relative deviation of 17.3%.

3. Analytical Specificity
(i) Interference
The Eonis SCID-SMA kit was evaluated for interference from the following potential
endogenous and exogenous sources:
• Hemoglobin up to 200g/L
• Conjugated bilirubin up to 16.6 mg/dL (166mg/L)
• Unconjugated bilirubin up to 10mg/dL (100mg/L)
• Intralipid up to 1500 mg/dL (15mg/mL)
• Li-hep up to 7500 USP/dL
• Na Citrate up to 0.0645 mol/L
• EDTA up to 9.8 mg/mL
The interference study was performed by 3 operators using 1 Eonis SCID-SMA Kit and 3
QuantStudio Dx Real-time PCR instruments. Three levels of TREC and KREC target DNA
(normal, near cut-off and endogenous were tested in conjunction with each level of
interferent (low and high). Blood samples were collected from healthy individuals and the
hematocrit was adjusted to 40-55% corresponding to the hematocrit of neonates (except
blood used in the hemoglobin sample series). Blood samples were then spiked with TREC
and KREC plasmid DNA to obtain the desired concentration levels. Blood samples with the
added potential interferent were used to prepare dried blood spots. The blood spots were
dried overnight and stored at -80°C. The specimens used are shown in Table 18.

were based on observed imprecision in the precision studies. The results indicated there was
no interference observed for any of the tested interferents. Hemoglobin at up to 200 g/L,
conjugated bilirubin at up to 16.6 mg/dL (=166 mg/L), unconjugated bilirubin at up to 10
mg/dL (=100 mg/L), Intralipid at up to 1500 mg/dL (15 mg/mL), Li-heparin at up to 7500
USP/dL, Na-citrate at up to 0.0645 mol/L, and EDTA at up to 9.8 mg/mL did not
significantly interfere with the Eonis SCID-SMA kit.
(ii) Primer and Probe Specificity
An in silico study was performed to assess the specificity of the primers and probes used in
the Eonis assay. Primer and probe specificity was assessed by using the online Standard
Nucleotide BLAST tool (Optimize for highly similar sequences, megablast) against the
Human genomic plus transcript (Human G + T) database published by the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
The BLAST analysis confirmed that there were only hits with 100% homology to the T
receptor alpha delta locus (TREC) on chromosome 14 along, the full length of the primer and
probe sequences, and 100% homology to the immunoglobulin kappa locus (IGK) on
chromosome 2, and to the ribonuclease P subunit p30 locus (RPP30) on chromosome 10.
There was no significant homology to other genome sequences.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Refer to the Results interpretation section.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
(i) Traceability
There are no recognized standards or reference material for TREC or KREC DNA. The kit
contains controls employed in the determination of TREC and KREC values.
(ii) Specimen Stability
The influence of storage time, temperature, and humidity was studied using DBS samples
prepared with two brands of filter paper. Samples were prepared by mixing cell lines and red
blood cell concentrate (mimicking a true positive sample for all 3 conditions), using cord
blood (mimicking a true negative sample) or by mixing cell lines, red blood cell concentrate
and cord blood for the near cut-off level samples.
After collection and preparation, the blood spots were dried overnight at ambient temperature
(+19–+25°C). The dried blood spots were then stored at different storage conditions. Storage
of specimens in an environment with elevated temperatures and humidity increases the risk
of inaccurate TREC/KREC results in normal or near cut-off samples. The TREC/KREC
results are shown in Figure 5a and Figure 5b.

(iii) Reagent Stability:
Stability studies were conducted to demonstrate the real time, in-use, and on-board stability
as well as transport shipping stress simulation of the Eonis DNA Extraction Kit components
and the Eonis SCID-SMA kit. The tests were performed after a transport simulation
treatment that simulates the worst-case conditions that can occur during packaging and
shipping. When a transport simulation treatment was performed, all the kit components were
used in the study. The stability testing was conducted in accordance with guideline EN ISO
23640 In vitro diagnostic medical devices – Evaluation of stability of in vitro diagnostic
reagents (2015) and CLSI Guideline EP25-A Evaluation of Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic
Reagents, Approved Guideline- Volume 29, No. 20 (2009).
The testing was performed at 7 months of the components’ shelf life. All Mean Ct values and
variation (standard deviation) results fulfilled the acceptance criteria at all tested time points.
At all tested time points, the results passed the data validity check. (Refer to DEN200044 for
details of the study design.) The following stability conditions apply based on the results:
• Eonis DNA Extraction Kit components (Wash Solution and Elution Solution) are
stable for 14 days at +19 - +25°C after first use.
• Eonis DNA extraction Kit components are stable in troughs for 30 minutes at +19 -
+25°C.
• Note: The Eonis DNA extraction Kit components are stable on board the JANUS
Extraction instrument in troughs for 2 hours.
• PCR Reagents 1 and 2 once thawed from -30°C to -16°C, are stable for 14 days at
+2°C to +8°C.
• PCR Reagents 1 and 2 are stable in their tubes uncapped on-board the JANUS PCR
Mastermix instrument for 2 hours at +19 to +25°C.
• The mixture of PCR Reagents 1 and 2 is stable for 15 minutes in a trough at +19 to
+25°C.
• The mixture of PCR Reagents 1 and 2 is stable for 2 hours in a sealed plate protected
from light.
• The SCID-SMA Kit controls are stable for 14 days after first use when stored at -
30°C to -16°C in a sealed bag with desiccant.
K203035 - Page 25 of 43

--- Page 26 ---
• The SCID-SMA Kit controls are stable on-board the JANUS Extraction instrument at
+19 to +25°C for 4 hours after they are punched into 96-well plates.
• Based on the results of the real-time and transport simulation stability study a shelf
life 180 days (6 months) is claimed for all Eonis SCID-SMA kit components, when
stored at the labeled storage temperature of -30°C - -16°C.
6. Detection Limit:
(i) Limit of Blank (LoB)
The LoB is the highest measurement result that is likely to be observed for a blank sample
that contains no analyte. The LoB study was performed using contrived analyte negative
samples created by spiking a Coriell cell line into leukocyte depleted blood which was TREC
and KREC negative. Five (5) individual contrived analyte-negative samples were prepared
by spiking the Coriell cell line into 5 different lots of leukocyte-depleted human blood with
the hematocrit adjusted to 40-55%. The study was performed by 1 operator using 2 sets of
Instrument Systems and 2 kit lots run over 5 days for a total of 10 runs. Six replicates were
tested in each run totaling 300 results (150 results/kit lot). For the RPP30 LoB, blank samples
were used (no punch/no template DNA), 20 replicates were tested in each run totaling 200
results (100 results/kit lot). Each plate contained kit controls NTC, C1, C2 and C3, assayed in
duplicate. Acceptance criteria were that the LoB of RPP30 must be zero; or any samples that
have RPP30 Ct ≥ 32.00 will be reported as ‘Invalid’ for TREC and KREC. The LoB of
TREC and KREC must be no greater than the LoD.
For TREC and KREC, all of the replicates had no Ct value reported. For RPP30, there were
two replicates having Ct values reported at 34.49 and 36.23; however, as this would lead to
an invalid result for the sample, the percentage of false-positive results for RPP30, defined as
the percentage of replicates of the blank sample that had a valid RPP30 Ct value ≤ 32.00 was
also zero for both kit lots. The LoB of TREC is 0 copies/µL blood, and the LoB of KREC is
0 copies/ µL blood.
(ii) Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
LoD and LoQ were evaluated separately for TREC and KREC. The LoD and LoQ studies
were performed using contrived samples prepared by diluting cord blood with adult
leucocyte-depleted human red blood that had TREC and/or KREC levels that were
undetectable by the Eonis SCID-SMA Kit. HL-60 cells were spiked into the adult leucocyte-
depleted blood to adjust the RPP30 Ct values to match the RPP30 Ct value in cord blood
(within 1 Ct difference). Each cord blood sample was diluted into different levels in which at
least the lowest three levels had yield hit rates within the range of 0.10 to 0.90 using the
corresponding diluents. The samples were then spotted onto filter paper and dried overnight.
For each analyte, TREC or KREC, the study was performed using 2 sets of instruments and 2
kit lots. One operator performed 2 runs per day, for 4 days, totaling 8 runs.
For each sample and each dilution, including negative samples (diluents), 5 replicates were
tested in each run, totaling 960 results with 20 replicates per dilution per lot. The final
dilutions used in the study and the corresponding number of positive results observed, total

number of measurements and hit rates observed for TREC and KREC are summarized in

The LoD was calculated using Probit analysis at 95% probability for each reagent kit lot.
Probit analysis in copies/105 cells unit was performed. The data collected from all 3 cord
blood samples and their dilutions were pooled for the calculation. The results for both kit lots
with 95% confidence intervals for TREC and KREC are summarized in Tables 21 and 22,
respectively. The LoD estimate is the concentration value that Probit analysis gives an
estimated hit rate of 95%.

The LoQ was evaluated as the functional sensitivity that represents the measurand
concentration associated with a desired within-laboratory precision, as exemplified by CLSI
guideline EP17-A2 Appendix D. Only the dilutions that yielded 100% hit rates were included
in the LoQ calculation. For each qualified dilution, the mean and the SD of the
concentrations in Ln (copies/105 cells) were calculated. A power function model (SD vs. the
mean concentration) was used to fit the datasets for each reagent kit lot. The LoQ estimate
for each reagent kit lot was determined as the predicted lowest concentration that has within-
laboratory precision equal to an SD ≤ 0.90 Ln (copies/105 cells) for TREC and ≤ 1.49 Ln
(copies/105 cells) for KREC. The results are shown in Tables 23 and 24.

9. Carry-Over:
A study was conducted to evaluate the potential for sample carryover to demonstrate control
of contamination during testing of samples with the Eonis reagent kits. The carryover test
was performed using 1 kit lot. The high-analyte positive sample was prepared by spiking
plasmid DNAs of each analyte into leukocyte-depleted human blood at levels lower than
29.71 for TREC Ct, 29.22 for KREC Ct, and 22.31 for RPP30 Ct, corresponding to the 10%
quantiles of a population of newborn specimens. The high analyte-positive sample and the
analyte-negative sample were placed in alternating rows and columns to produce a
checkerboard configuration. The observed carryover percentage was 0% for the three
analytes.

Filter Paper Reproducibility
A filter paper reproducibility study was conducted using filter paper from 2 manufacturers in
order to evaluate manufacturer difference, lot differences, as well as to assess homogeneity
across dried blood spots (DBS). Between paper manufacturer and paper lots were evaluated
using samples spotted on 3 lots of each filter paper brand.
The study was conducted using a subset of the samples that were used in the precision and 3-
site reproducibility studies (although some at different concentrations) covering high, normal
and low levels of each analyte (Table 5).

Each analyte was manually spotted on 3 filter paper lots at 85 µL per spot.
One operator performed 1 run per day for 5 days for a total of 5 runs and using 1 kit lot and 1
Eonis SCID-SMA test system. Six samples were prepared on 3 lots of each filter paper brand
for a total of 36 conditions (6 samples x 3 lots x 2 filter paper brands = 36). Each run
consisted of 3 96-well extraction plates (2 randomized sample sets per plate plus 2 sets of kit
controls) and 1 384-well PCR plate in each testing day.
To assess the homogeneity of the analytes across the DBS, 5 replicates of each condition
were punched from 5 different locations of each spot in the following order: top, left, center,
right, bottom. The study generated 900 results (25 replicates x 6 samples x 3 filter paper lots
x 2 filter paper brands) with 150 results per sample and 450 results per filter paper brand. The
total variation lnSD results are compared to the product specification for total variation
(“Acceptance criteria”) and are shown in Table 25. The total variation lognormal CV%
results are presented in Table 26.

ANOVA results in Table 27 below demonstrate that there were statistically significant
differences between paper manufacturers (Sample #2/KREC) and between paper lots
(Sample #11/TREC and KREC); however, the highest between lot variation was 0.06
(Sample #11/TREC and KREC), and the highest between manufacturer variation was 0.09
(Sample #2/KREC). Per study acceptance criteria, the variation between these samples would
not be clinically significant. The data demonstrated the similarity in performance between
two major brands of filter paper.

C Clinical Studies:
(i) Specimens
A clinical study was conducted at one foreign testing site, the Statens Serum Institute (SSI) in
Denmark. SSI is the same site that conducted the study for the PerkinElmer EnLite Neonatal
TREC Assay (DEN140010). The majority of the DBS specimens tested for the clinical study
(retrospective, anonymized residual [leftover] newborn specimens) were procured by SSI
from the screened Danish population. Specimen collection was prospective-retrospective and
enriched with confirmed positive specimens for SCID and XLA which came from two
biobanks: Danish Neonatal Screening Biobank and the California Biobank. Additionally, 3 of
the 4 confirmed positive samples for XLA were procured from the SSI. Confirmed positive
specimens were also procured from the California Department of Public Health Genetic
Disease Screening Program Biobank (CA), including SCID (all 17 specimens) and XLA (1
of 4 confirmed specimens). All samples were tested at SSI as part of the evaluation. Age
matched control specimens were used and presumed to be normal and were archived just
before and after the time period during which the confirmed positive specimens for each of
the two disorders (SCID, XLA) were archived. These specimens were used as controls for
storage conditions to ensure specimen integrity remained intact within the timeframe during
which they were stored. Therefore, in addition to consecutive specimens, archived specimens
with storage time matched to the storage time of positive specimens were included. Specimen
inclusion/exclusion criteria were provided and included specimen age, and storage
conditions.
(ii) Inclusion/Exclusion criteria for assessment of specimens
The age of the newborns at the time of specimen collection was less than or equal to 7 days
to mimic the expected intended use population and a typical sample collection age for first
tier screening to enable early diagnosis. Routine newborn screening specimens originating
from the study site were collected at least 5.5 years ago to be able to assess, based on medical
records, that the subject had not been identified to present clinical signs attributable to SCID
or XLA. The confirmed positive SCID or XLA specimens had been collected ≤ 17 years
before the start date of the study to avoid inclusion of sample stored for longer than that time
period. Confirmed positive XLA samples were difficult to procure; therefore, samples
violating the upper limit of the storage time or the limit for the age of the newborn at the time
of sample collection were included.
Inclusion criteria included the following:
• Age of the newborn at the time of specimen collection ≤ 7 days
• Specimen storage conditions are known
• Specimen collected at least 5.5 years ago (from study start)
For specimens confirmed positive for SCID:
• Specimen confirmed positive for typical SCID (documentation of confirmed
diagnosis and/or documentation of flow cytometry result)
• Date of specimen collection is ≤ 17 years from the start date of the study
For specimens confirmed positive for XLA:
K203035 - Page 35 of 43

--- Page 36 ---
• Specimen confirmed positive for XLA (e.g., documentation of BTK gene
mutation and/or flow cytometry result)
• Date of specimen collection is ≤ 17 years from the start date of the study
In addition, for storage age-matched control specimens:
• Date of specimen collection is known
• Specimen collected just before or after the time period during which the
confirmed positive specimens for SCID and/or XLA was collected
Exclusion criteria included the following:
• The DBS is not of appropriate quality (i.e., DBS is scratched, abraded, show signs of
incomplete saturation or supersaturation, dilution, discoloration, or contamination)
• Parents/guardians have opted out for use of the specimen beyond routine screening
• Repeat specimen from a newborn whose specimen is already included in the study
• Less than one disk with a diameter of 3.2 mm (1/8 inch) of DBS available in the cut-
off phase, and less than two disks available in the pivotal phase for routine specimens
In addition, for specimens confirmed positive for SCID:
• Other than typical SCID, such as less acute SCID (e.g., leaky SCID, variant
SCID) or SCID like syndromes (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome or Omenn syndrome)
In addition, for specimens confirmed positive for XLA:
• Atypical XLA or female carriers
(iii) Study Design:
A total of 6924 unique specimens were tested in the study: 3432 specimens were tested in the
cut-off phase and 3484 specimens were tested in the pivotal phase (this number includes 17
SCID cases, 6 XLA cases and 52 SMA cases; SMA cases are deducted from the table – refer
to DEN200044). The main study consisted of two phases. Specimens in the cut-off study
were not retested in the pivotal study.
Cut-off Phase: Newborn specimens representative of samples of the target population at the
study site were tested with the device to produce newborn population distribution data for
TREC and KREC and to select clinical cut-off values for the pivotal study. The number of
false positives for TREC and KREC were determined from the data using lower percentiles
0.3%, 0.5, and 1% and are shown in Table 28.

Pivotal Phase: Presumed unaffected newborn specimens representing the target population at
the study site were supplemented with confirmed positive specimens collected from SCID
and 6 XLA affected newborns. A total of 3432 unique samples as shown in Table 29 (after
subtracting 52 SMA cases – refer to DEN200044), were assessed in the pivotal phase. After
exclusion of the samples not fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a total of 3383
samples were included in the final analysis. Demographic characteristics of the routine
screening specimens and confirmed positive samples were collected. These included: age at
the time of sample collection (mean 2.5 days); weight distribution of the newborns at the
time of specimen collection (95% ≥ 2500g); gestational age (98% ≥ 34 weeks); and gender
(50.6% male and 49.4% female).

Confirmatory test results were used as the comparator for the confirmed positive SCID or
XLA cases including the presence of BTK mutation for XLA. Determination of the true
clinical status with regard to SCID has been previously described (DEN140010). The true
clinical status with regard to XLA was assessed using data available in patient registries. The
clinical assessment of the study subjects was obtained from their medical records to confirm
that the subject, at 5.5 years of age (defined as 66 months) or younger, has not been identified
with XLA (has no clinical signs attributable to XLA) and is apparently healthy. Danish
hospital registry data were reviewed by filtering out subjects that had at least one of the 275
ICD10 diagnosis codes that were listed as potentially linked to XLA. By the age of 5.5 years,
a subject with a XLA would have either:
• Been diagnosed with the XLA; or
• Presented with serious medical complications suggestive of XLA as listed below:

To establish the screening performance, the cut-offs for TREC and KREC were determined
by calculating the TREC and KREC concentrations corresponding to the 0.3th and 1.0th
population percentiles (262 copies/105 cells for TREC, 484 copies/105 cells for KREC)
established in the cut-off study with an independent dataset and were applied in the pivotal
study
Testing was in singlicate unless repeat testing was necessary due to an invalid result. The
specimens having TREC and KREC levels below the cut-off values (i.e., potential positives)
in the initial round of testing were re-tested in duplicate. Any invalids were also retested in
singlicate per protocol. If either replicate was positive, the sample was considered positive.
All 3 replicates were required to be negative for the sample to be negative. The final results
(presumptive normal, presumptive positive, invalid result) were classified after the second
round of testing according to the testing interpretation algorithm.
The Eonis SCID-SMA kits’ performance with each subjects’ sample was compared to the
clinical data/outcome captured for that subject. Status of SCID patients were determined
previously (DEN140010). A total of 18 subjects had screen positive results with initial
KREC results below the cut-off (suggestive for XLA). After replicate testing, 9 subjects with
repeat test KREC results below cut-off (one or both replicates below cut-off) remained. For
all 18 subjects, the status was alive at 5.5 years after birth, and 6 subjects had at least one
ICD10 code listed in the registry. Of these 6 subjects, none had multiple diagnosis that were
indicative of XLA, nor did they have diagnosis that mandated further investigation. Thus, all
were concluded to be unaffected for XLA (Table 31).

D Clinical Cut-Off:
TREC: 262 copies/105 cells
KREC: 484 copies/105 cells
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The incidence of SCID is approximately 1 in 50,000 live births.1 The incidence of XLA is
approximately 1 in 190,000 live male births.2 The distribution of a newborn population was
determined by analyzing 3341 newborn DBS from the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank
(NBS-Biobank) with the Eonis SCID-SMA kit. The specimens were archived routine screening
specimens. The TREC and KREC descriptive statistics (median and range of results observed)
and the value at which 0.3, 0.5, or 1.0 percent of the specimens were below of the specimens are
displayed in Table 28. Data separated by gender for KREC is shown in Table 37.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
DNA Extraction Equivalency
This study was conducted to demonstrate that Eonis test system has equivalent performance
when the DNA extraction is performed either manually or by a different automated liquid
handler and is designed based on the recommendation of CLSI Guideline EP05-A.
Two operators performed 3 Eonis extractions and PCR consolidations/day for 5 days using 1 kit
lot, totaling 30 runs using 7 samples from the precision study (Table 5). Each day, an operator
would run 1 extraction/PCR consolidation on the same JANUS Extraction/JANUS PCR
Mastermix, 1 extraction/PCR consolidation on a second commercial liquid handler, and 1
manual extraction manual PCR setup/consolidation. The study generated a total of 1050 results
(5 replicates x 7 samples x 3 extraction/PCR methods x 2 operators x 5 days) with 150 results per
sample and 350 results per extraction/PCR method.
There were 45 replicates performed with the JANUS handler, 50 replicates for the second
commercial liquid handler, and 50 replicates for the manual extraction process. The results for
TREC and KREC, evaluated using variance analysis method, are presented in Table 38 and
Table 39.
