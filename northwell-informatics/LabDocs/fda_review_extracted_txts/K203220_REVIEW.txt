IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The cobas BKV is a quantitative test performed on the cobas 6800 System and cobas 8800
System. cobas BKV enables the detection of BKV DNA in plasma and cobas PCR media
stabilized urine specimens. The cobas BKV is a dual target assay, with both targets using the
same dye. The DNA Internal Control, used to monitor the entire sample preparation and PCR
amplification process, is introduced into each specimen during sample processing. The cobas
BKV enables the detection and quantitation of BKV DNA in transplant patients.
The cobas BKV is intended for use as an aid in the management of BKV in transplant patients.
In patients undergoing monitoring of BKV, serial DNA measurements can be used to indicate
the need for potential treatment changes and to assess viral response to treatment.
The cobas BKV Kit system consists of:
• Proteinase Solution
K203220 - Page 2 of 29

--- Page 3 ---
• DNA Quantitation Standard (DNA QS)
• Elution Buffer
• Master Mix Reagent 1
• BKV Master Mix Reagent 2
The BKV viral load is quantified against a non-BKV DNA Quantitation Standard (DNA-QS),
which is introduced into each specimen during sample preparation. The DNA-QS also functions
as an internal control for sample preparation and the PCR amplification process.
In addition, the test utilizes the following separately packed and sold control materials:
1. cobas EBV/BKV Positive Control Kit:
• EBV/BKV Low Positive Control (EBV/BKV L(+)C)
• EBV/BKV High Positive Control (EBV/BKV H(+)C)
The positive control contains phage packaged EBVBKV and BKV DNA in normal human
plasma and serves as a control for the cobas BKV test.
2. cobas Negative Control Kit:
• cobas Buffer Negative Control (BUF (-) C)
Testing with the cobas BKV test requires the following materials that are not provided:
• cobas OMNI Reagents
• cobas BKV Assay Specific Analysis Package (ASAP) software
The cobas BKV test uses sample preparation (nucleic acid extraction and purification) followed
by PCR amplification and detection, all steps are fully automated by the cobas 6800/8800
platform.
B Principle of Operation:
The cobas BKV test is a quantitative PCR test performed on the fully automated cobas 6800/
8800 Systems that detects and quantifies BKV DNA from (EDTA) plasma and cobas PCR media
stabilized urine specimens of transplant patients as follows.
Target Selection
Selective amplification of BKV target nucleic acid from the sample is achieved using specific
forward and reverse primers which are selected to amplify highly-conserved regions of the BKV
DNA VP-2 and T-antigen gene. Specific fluorescence labeled probes for each amplicon are used
to detect and quantify the BKV targets from subtypes I, II, III and IV as well as subgroups Ia, Ib,
Ic, IVa, IVb, and IVc. Selective amplification and detection of a DNA Quantitation Standard
(DNA-QS) is achieved using specific forward and reverse primers and a DNA-QS specific probe
all specifically selected to have no homology with the BKV genome.
Sample Preparation (Nucleic Acid Extraction and Purification)
Nucleic acid from patient samples and external controls are extracted upon addition of the DNA
DNA-QS. The DNA-QS molecules are extracted simultaneously with the samples/controls
K203220 - Page 3 of 29

--- Page 4 ---
serving as an extraction control. Viral nucleic acid is released by addition of proteinase and lysis
reagent to the sample. The released nucleic acid, along with the added DNA-QS binds to
magnetic glass particles. Unbound substances and impurities are removed with subsequent wash
reagent steps and purified nucleic acid is then eluted from the magnetic glass particles with
elution buffer.
Nucleic Acid Amplification and Target Detection
The cobas BKV master mix contains detection probes which are specific for the two BKV target
sequences and the DNA-QS nucleic acid, respectively. The two BKV specific detection probes
are labeled with the same HEX fluorescent dye while the DNA-QS detection probe is labeled
with the CY5.5 fluorescent dye both acting as reporter dyes. Each probe also has a second dye,
BHQ, which acts as a quencher that suppresses the fluorescent signals of the intact probes when
they are not bound to their respective target sequence. Target bound probes, however, emit
fluorescence of the two reporter dyes. This fluorescence is measured at defined wavelengths,
thus permitting simultaneous detection and discrimination of the BKV targets and the DNA-QS
amplification products generated by a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme.
BKV DNA Quantitation
During the extension phase of the PCR process, fluorescence readings are processed to generate
Ct values for the BKV DNA target and the BKV QS DNA. The lot-specific calibration constants
provided with the cobas BKV test are used to calculate the titer value for the specimens and
controls based on both the BKV DNA target and the BKV QS DNA Ct values. BKV viral load
results are reported in International Units/mL (IU/mL).
C Interpretation of Results:

human EDTA plasma and the test should be repeated. Multiply the reported result by the dilution factor.
D Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
cobas 6800/8800
2. Specimen Identification:
The specimen identification information is captured and stored as a digital record. Whole
blood and Urine specimens are collected in appropriate sample collection tubes as per
instructions for use (IFU) and prepared for the test procedure as described in detail in the
cobas 6800/8800 Systems – User Assistance and/or User Guide.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Managed by a trained technician as per IFU. Urine specimens must be transferred into the
cobas PCR media tube with stabilizer immediately after collection. The specimen can be
stored at 2°C to 30°C up to 24 hours if it cannot be stabilized immediately.
4. Calibration:
The lot-specific calibration constants are provided with the cobas BKV test. The cobas
6800/8800 Systems automatically determine the BKV DNA concentration for the samples
and controls. The BKV DNA concentration is expressed in International Units per milliliter
(IU/mL).
5. Quality Control:
One negative control [(–) C] and two positive controls, a low positive control [EBV/BKV
L(+)C] and a high positive control [EBV/BKV H(+)C] is processed with each batch. The
batch is valid if no flags appear for any of the three controls. The negative control result is
displayed as (–) C and the low and high positive controls are displayed as EBV/BKV L(+)C
and EBV/BKV H(+)C. Invalidation of results is performed automatically by the cobas
6800/8800 software based on negative and positive control failures.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance characteristics with plasma specimens can be found in K202215
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision:
Precision was assessed for the predominant BKV Subgroup 1b by serially diluting BKV 1b
lambda stock in BKV negative pooled urine stabilized in cobas PCR media (1:1 dilution) to
generate a 7-member panel ranging from a nominal concentration of 300 IU/mL to 1x108 IU/mL.
Precision was calculated on results generated with 21 replicates per run, two runs per day for 12
days using three kit lots, two cobas 6800 systems and two operators for a total of 72 replicates
per panel member (PM). Results were analyzed according to CLSI guideline EP05-A3. Only
replicates with titers within the linear range of the assay (2.0E+02 to 1.0E+8 IU/mL) were used
for data analysis. For PM1, the assigned concentration was 7.41 x 107 IU/mL and 15/21
replicates had results above the Upper Limit of Quantification; therefore, results from those 15
replicates were excluded from the analysis. For PM7 the assigned concentration was 222 IU/mL
and 2/72 replicates had results below the LLoQ; therefore, results from those two replicates were
excluded from the analysis. The results for cobas BKV precision calculated for seven dilution
levels are shown in Table 1.

* Titer data are considered to be log-normally distributed and are analyzed following log10 transformation. Standard deviations (SD) columns present the total of the log-transformed titer
for each of the three reagent lots.
The variance component analysis demonstrated the contribution of the components of variance to the total precision variance (Table 2).
Overall, the total precision as SD of the log titer is comparable across the three kit lots tested and met the acceptance criteria.

2. Reproducibility Study:
Reproducibility of cobas BKV was evaluated in BKV PCR negative pooled urine stabilized in cobas PCR media (1:1 dilution) across three
Reagent Lots, three Test Sites, three Instruments (two cobas 6800 Systems at two sites and one cobas 8800 System at the third site). Two
runs were performed per operator per day (1 run = 2 batches; 1 batch = 1 panel + 3 controls) over five days per reagent lot and each run had
three replicates per panel member for a total of 270 replicates/concentration.
Test panel members were prepared from BKV PCR-negative pooled urine spiked with either the BKV WHO Standard or BKV genotype 1b
genomic material in the form of BKV cell culture supernatant. Test panel members had the following concentrations: Negative, 600 IU/mL
(3x LLoQ), 5x103 IU/mL, 5x104 IU/mL, 5x105 IU/mL, and 5x107 IU/mL (0.5x ULoQ). One of the 92 batches tested failed due to operator
error and one failed due to instrument error. Across the three testing sites, positive panel members produced 1,350 valid results. All 270 test
results were valid for the negative panel members. The results are summarized in Table 3.

c %TV = Percent contribution to Total Variance.
d CV% = Lognormal percent coefficient of variation = sqrt(10^[SD^2 * ln(10)] - 1) * 100
e Calculated using the total variability from the SAS MIXED procedure
Note: The table only includes results with detectable DNA level. SD = standard deviation. CV = coefficient of variation; and BKV = BK Virus
Analysis of variance and a mixed model that included lot, site, day/operator, batch and within-batch (random error) as random effects was
performed. The variance contribution of each component to the total variance was estimated. The range of the total lognormal coefficient of
variation, among positive panel members, ranged from 6.87% to 16.47%. The largest total lognormal coefficient of variation was observed
in the lowest positive panel member (3x LLoQ). Most of that variability (59% of the total variance) was attributed to lot variability at one
clinical testing site. High within-batch variability was also observed for panel members with BKV DNA tested at 5.7 and 7.7 log IU/mL
10
across the three clinical testing sites and may be due to the samples being tested close to the ULoQ (0.5x ULoQ).
3. Linearity:
Two linearity panels were tested: one panel composed of a dilution series of 12 panel members was prepared by diluting a BKV subgroup
1b (GT 1b) lambda DNA (phagemid) in a BKV-negative urine pool, and one panel composed of a dilution series of 10 panel members was
prepared by diluting a subgroup 1b clinical specimen in a BKV-negative urine pool. Both panels were tested at each concentration level
(Table 4). The highest assigned titer for the phagemid panel was 7.41E+08 IU/mL and the highest assigned titer for the clinical panel was
9.22E+06 IU/mL. The phagemid and clinical panel members overlapped in the measuring range, from a nominal titer of 1.00E+07 IU/mL to
1.00E+02 IU/mL (below the LLoQ).

Testing was performed using three cobas 8800 instruments by three operators on 12 replicates for each concentration using three kit lots (a
total of 36 replicates per concentration). Nine runs were performed, all of which were valid and yielded a total of 792 valid results. Results
were analyzed according to CLSI standard EP06-A.
The parameter estimates of b0, b1, b2, and b3 are presented for 1st order linear and 3rd order polynomial fits (Table 5). For all the test kits
and sample types combined, both the higher order coefficients (b2 and b3) were significant at 5% level. The 3rd order fit was chosen as the
best fitting regression model as it had the smaller Root Mean Square Error (Figure 1). The maximal difference between the linear and 3rd
order fits was observed for the lowest clinical panel member with a nominal titer of 1.00E+02 IU/mL (below the LLoQ of the assay).

Figure 1: Linearity Across Both Panel Types and All Kit Lots Combined
No bias was found between the log titers for the Phagemid and Clinical panel members when
10
analyzed separately. The linearity across both panel types (phagemid and clinical sample) and all
kit lots combined is shown in Figure 1.
The linear range of cobas BKV, defined as the concentration range for which the deviation of
predicted log titer of the better fitting regression (2nd or 3rd order) and the predicted log titer
10 10
of the linear regression (1st order) is within ± 0.3 log was determined.
10
The observed linear range of the cobas BKV assay with urine is 7.40E+01 to 7.41E+08 IU/mL.
The claimed linear range of the cobas BKV assay with urine is 2.00E+02 IU/mL to 1.0E+08
IU/mL.
4. Verification of Linearity of cobas BKV with other genotypes:
Linearity was assessed for five BKV subgroup/subtype panels, one for each genotype, spanning
the linear range from the LLoQ of 2.00E+02 IU/mL to the ULoQ of 1.00E+08 IU/mL.
Intermediate Stock Solutions (ISS) for each genotype were verified using either the QIAGEN
artus BK virus QS-RGQ PCR kit (subgroup Ia and phagemids of subtypes II, III and IV) or by
digital droplet PCR (subgroup Ic).
Serial dilutions ranging from a nominal titer of 1.00E+08 IU/mL (ULoQ) to 2.00E+01 IU/mL
(LLoQ) were made from BKV subgroup Ia cell culture supernatant, phagemids of BKV
subgroup Ic, and subtypes II, III, and IV. The dilutions were prepared in BKV-negative pooled
urine stabilized in cobas PCR media, yielding an 8-member panel. Four replicates were tested
per panel member. Subgroup Ia was tested using three kit lots and two cobas 6800/8800
Systems. Subgroup Ic, and subtypes II, III and IV, were tested using three kit lots and one cobas
6800/8800 System. Nine runs were performed of which all nine were valid yielding a total of
480 test results.
K203220 - Page 14 of 29

--- Page 15 ---
Linear (1st order) and nonlinear, 2nd order and 3rd order, regression fits were performed for all
genotypes tested for all lots combined. The Root Mean Square Error (MSE) of the 3rd order was
smallest and was chosen as the best fitting regression model to calculate the absolute difference
between the predicted log titer obtained from the 1st and 3rd order regression fits. Both higher
order coefficients (b2 and b3) were significant at 5% level.
The linear range of each BKV genotype (subgroups Ia, Ic, and subtypes II, III, and IV) was
established from 2.00E+02 IU/mL to 1.00E+08 IU/mL, the same as that of the predominant
subgroup Ib (Table 6). For all genotypes tested, the absolute deviation was ≤0.21 log IU/mL at
10
all concentration levels.

5. Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLoQ):
The analysis of the Lower Limit of Quantitation was performed with data obtained from the
Linearity study using the WHO standard. The LLoQ is the lowest titer within the linear range
with a hit rate of at least 95% that meets the acceptance criterion for the Total Analytical Error
(TAE) and the “Difference between Measurements in SD” approach. The acceptance criteria for
TAE are:
1. The TAE, when calculated as |Bias| + 2SD, is ≤1.0 log IU/mL, and
10
2. The TAE has to be such that the standard deviation for the difference between two
measurements calculated as SQRT(2) x 2 x SD is ≤ 1.0 log IU/mL
10
The panel members at the lowest nominal concentration of 1.00E+02 IU/mL for both phagemid
and clinical samples met the TAE and “Difference between the Measurements” criteria. For the
clinical panel members in the linearity study, the maxim deviation of 0.08 Log IU/mL between
10
the linear regression and the better fitting higher order model was obtained at the nominal
concentration of 1.00E+02 IU/mL. However, the LLoQ was set at the concentration level of
2.00E+02 IU/mL to include the mean deviation between the observed vs. the assigned log titer
10
(Accuracy) being equal or less than ± 0.3 log , based on the upper 95% confidence interval of
10
the worst performing lot (Lot#2, ED3280) using clinical specimen. Table 7 presents the LLoQ
calculated for each kit lot and combined across all the kit lots.

6. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross reactivity
For potential cross reactants 34 microorganisms, including two viral isolates, 27 bacterial
strains, four fungal isolates and one cultured protozoa were used and divided into eight pools
with two to five microorganisms per cross reactant pool. Mycoplasma genitalium (MGE) and
Ureaplasma urealyticum (UUR) were used as single interferents.
Potential cross reactants in BKV negative pooled urine stabilized with cobas PCR media
were tested in the absence and presence of BKV DNA at a concentration of 600 IU/mL
(approximately 3x LLoQ). Potential cross reactants were tested at 1x106 copies/mL, IU/mL,
TCID50/mL, cells/mL, CFU/mL, IFU/mL or CCU/mL for each organism as appropriate
except for HPV and HSV-2, which were tested at 1x105. MGE and UUR was tested
individually at 2x106 CCU/mL. Testing was performed using six replicates per cross reactive
pool or individual interferents, 28 replicates of the BKV-positive and 24 replicates for the
BKV - negative controls using three kit lots and one cobas 8800 system.
For BKV negative samples the negativity rate was determined. Four samples from Pools 3
and 5 spiked in BKV-negative pooled urine were positive for BKV DNA. Although the
individual urine samples used for preparing the BKV-negative pooled urine were PCR tested
to confirm non-reactivity, the individual donors were not screened for sero-negativity. Thus,
to resolve the discrepancy, cross reactants in Pools 3 and 5 were tested individually in a
second pool of confirmed BKV-negative urine (Table 8). All BKV-negative specimens
spiked with cross reactants tested negative for BKV DNA.
For BKV-positive samples the positivity rate was determined together with the correct
quantitation of BKV DNA by computing the Mean concentration detected across the
replicates, the SD and the difference between the control condition (no cross reactant) and

The mean log titers of the positive BKV samples containing potentially cross-reacting
10
organisms were within ± 0.5 log of the mean log titer of the respective positive spike

control.
Endogenous Interference
The effect of potentially interfering endogenous substances on the sensitivity/quantitation of
cobas BKV was determined by testing 20 individual BKV-negative urine samples spiked
with selected endogenous substances and tested in the presence of BKV DNA at a
concentration of 600 IU/mL (approximately 3x LLoQ). The negative sample spiked solely
with BKV target was used as a Positive Spike Control (PSC). To analyze specificity, the
same 20 individual clinical negative samples were individually spiked with potentially
interfering endogenous substances and tested in the absence of BKV target DNA. The un-
spiked samples were used as Negative Spiked Controls (NSC). Ten potentially interfering
substances were tested. Control conditions were tested with one replicate per specimen, and
test conditions were tested with three replicates per specimen. All specimens were stabilized
in cobas PCR media (1:1 ratio) before testing. Results are summarized in Table 9.

Exogenous Interference
The effect of potentially interfering exogenous substances on the sensitivity/quantitation of
cobas BKV Urine assay was determined by testing 10 individual BKV-negative urine
samples spiked with commercially available drugs/substances. The same samples were also
tested in the presence of BKV target at 600 IU/mL (approximately 3x LLoQ). The negative
samples spiked solely with BKV target was used as a Positive Spike Control (PSC). The un-
spiked samples were used as Negative Spiked Controls (NSC). Conditions were tested with
one replicate for the unspiked specimens and three replicates for the BKV spiked specimens.
All specimens were stabilized in cobas PCR media (1:1 ratio) before testing. The results are
summarized in Table 10 below.

Traceability
The traceability study for the WHO BKV standard was provided with cobas BKV for EDTA-
plasma (K202215). BKV DNA levels of WHO standard in urine stabilized in cobas PCR
media were accurately determined across the linear range from 2.0E+02 to 1.0E+07 IU/ml
with a maximum inaccuracy less than 0.20 log IU/ml close to the LLoQ. Additional data
10
from the clinical reproducibility study, for BKV DNA WHO standard in spiked at 3xLLoQ
to 250x LLoQ in stabilized urine, showed the observed mean was ± 0.14 log of the
10
expected titers.
Stability
The clinical specimen stability of BKV viral target in neat urine specimens (NUS) prior to
addition of the cobas PCR media as well as in urine specimens stabilized (USS) in the cobas
PCR media after various storage, processing, and transportation conditions between 2°C to
30°C were evaluated using cobas BKV for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems. BKV-
positive urine specimens collected from six individuals with titers above 2x LLoQ (> 400
IU/mL) were used to prepare the Clinical Stability Study (CSS) panel. Time points for NUS
included T0 (immediately after collection, used as reference), T1 (25h at 2°C to 8°C), T2 (5h
at 30°C ± 2°C), and T3 (5h at 30°C ± 2°C + 21h at 2°C to 8°C). For the USS specimens,
panel members were stored at 30°C ± 2°C and tested at 33, 47, 91 and 92 days.
Of the BKV-positive clinical urine specimens tested, the mean log titers including the two-
10
sided 95 confidence interval of each of the tested time points/conditions and tube types was
within ±0.5 log of the mean log titer of the respective reference condition (T0 =
10 10
reference). However, there was one sample which did not meet the acceptance criteria, and
this may be due to non-homogeneity of the BKV-positive urine sample. A labeling
precaution has been included in the package insert indicating that urine specimens must be
transferred into cobas PCR media tubes and stabilized immediately after collection.
Procedural limitations have been included in the IFU stating that the test is validated only for
use with stabilized urine because quantitative variability of BKV target inherent to urine
specimens has been observed in non-stabilized urine.
These results support the following storage conditions:
• Neat urine can be stored at 2°C to 30°C for up to 24 hours.
• Specimens stabilized in cobas PCR media can be stored at 2°C to 30°C for up to 90
days.
Open kit and On-board Stability
On-Board Stability and Open Kit Stability has been established for the predicate device. The
cobas BKV 192T test-specific reagent cassettes are stable for up to 90 days at 2– 8°C (Open
Kit Stability) and remain stable for up to 40 hours at 37°C (On-Board Stability). The 192T
test-specific reagent cassettes can be used up to 40 times.
Reagent Stability
Three lots of the cobas BKV were tested to demonstrate stability of the test-specific reagents
of cobas BKV and cobas EBV/BKV Control Kit when stored at stressed temperature
K203220 - Page 21 of 29

--- Page 22 ---
conditions (accelerated stability) and at the targeted storage temperature of 2°C to 8°C (real-
time stability).
Accelerated Stability: The kit components BKV MMX-R2 192T, EBV/BKV H(+)C, and the
EBV/BKV L(+)C were stored at 37°C ± 2°C for up to 75 days and tested at various time
points. All lots met the acceptance criteria at all testing time points (26d, 41d, 51d, 63d, and
75d). The 75 days accelerated stability results predict a 19-month real-time stability for the
test-specific reagents of cobas BKV and cobas EBV/BKV Control Kit.
Real-time stability: The kit components BKV MMX-R2 192T, EBV/BKV H(+)C, and the
EBV/BKV L(+)C were stored at 2-8°C for up to 13 months and tested at various time points.
All lots met the acceptance criteria at all testing time points (3m, 6m, 9m, 12m, 13m, 16m,
18m, 19m).
Shelf-life: Based on the combined data of accelerated and real-time stability studies the
results support a shelf-life of 18 months when stored at 2-8°C.
Reagent stability has been established for 18 month upon the storage conditions indicated in
the IFU.
Expected values for Quality Controls
To monitor the assay performance, reagent performance, and procedural errors, positive and
negative external controls must be run in accordance with the guidelines or requirements of
local, state, and/or federal regulations or accrediting organizations.
External Controls are provided in the cobas EBV/Positive Control Kit and the cobas Buffer
Negative Control Kit, separately from the cobas BKV test kit. The cobas EBV/BKV positive
control consists of BKV phagemid DNA diluted into BKV-negative human plasma at two
concentrations to yield the EBV/BKV Low Positive Control (EBV/BKV L(+)C) and the
EBV/BKV High Positive Control (EBV/BKV H(+)C). The cobas Buffer Negative Control
consists of Tris buffer with <0.002% Poly rA RNA. The cobas BKV Negative Control, the
BKV Low Positive Control, and the BKV High Positive Control must be included in each
run. The validity of the results for the controls as well as for the DNA-QS (internal control) is
determined by the assay-specific analysis software package used by the cobas 6800/8800
instrument. The amount of BKV DNA for BKV-high and -low positive controls must fall
within their acceptable titer ranges.
The failure rates of the kit controls and samples were assessed by evaluating outcomes of the
nine analytical studies (LoD, LoD verification for Genotype, Linearity, Linearity verification
for Genotype, Precision, Carry-Over, Lot interchangeability, Accuracy, and LoD in in urine
samples ). Results demonstrated an overall invalid rate of 0.00% for QS, 0.00% for RMC and
a 0.02% sample failure rate.
9. Detection Limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD) using the 1st WHO International Standard for BKV in urine
K203220 - Page 22 of 29

--- Page 23 ---
The LoD of the cobas BKV test for the 1st WHO BKV Standard (BKV Subgroup 1b) was
determined by analysis of serial dilutions of the Standard diluted into a pooled urine derived
from BKV negative individuals and stabilized in cobas PCR media (1:1 dilution). Panels of
six concentration levels plus a blank were tested with three lots of cobas BKV test reagents
and four instruments with multiple runs and operators over a period of three days. Each
dilution was tested in 63 replicates per lot and day (n=189 total replicates per day).
The results from testing the WHO BKV Standard in pooled urine as well as the calculated
LoD values are shown in the table below. The LoD and LLoQ values were determined by
Probit analysis and by 95% hit rate (Table 11).

--- Page 24 ---
When determined by Probit analysis, the LoD for all three kit lots combined is 11.4 IU/mL
(95% CI: 9.7 – 14.0 IU/mL). The LoD by 95% hit rate was 10.0 IU/mL (181/189) and was
identical for all tested lots. The highest LoD of 12.2 IU/mL was obtained with kit lot 1, which is
only slightly higher than the LoD determined by 95% hit rate. The claimed LoD value is 12.2
IU/mL (95% CI: 9.2 – 18.3 IU/mL) and this concentration was used in studies for confirmation
of the LoD.
Verification of the Limit of Detection (LoD) with genotypes of subgroup Ia, Ic, and subtypes II,
II, and IV in urine
The LoD (12.2 IU/mL) was verified for the cobas BKV test with BKV subgroup Ia, Ic, and
subtypes II, III, and IV following the CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. For subgroups Ia, subtypes
II and IV clinical specimens were used. Due to lack of clinical specimens phagemids for
subgroup Ic was used. BKV-positive material was diluted in BKV-PCR negative pooled
urine stabilized with cobas PCR media to prepare the ISS. The ISS titer was confirmed by an
alternate assay with three replicates. For subgroup Ic, digital droplet PCR was used to
confirm the initial titer as this subgroup was not detectable by the alternate assay. Each panel
consisted of three concentration levels around the LoD 1.5x (18.3 IU/mL), 1.0x (12.2
IU/mL), 0.5x (6.1 IU/mL).
A total of 63 replicates per concentration level were tested across three dilution series, three
instruments and three kit lots. A different operator tested each dilution series.
The results are presented in Table 12 and verify that a hit rate of 95% or higher was observed
at 12.2 IU/mL (1x LoD) for BKV genotypes. Thus, the observed hit rates verify the LoD for
BKV in urine at 12.2 IU/mL.

12. Carry-Over:
The carry-over rate for cobas BKV was determined by testing 240 replicates of an BKV-
negative pooled urine sample and 225 replicates of a high titer BKV sample at 1.00E+09
IU/mL (5x106x LLoQ). The high titer sample was prepared by spiking a high-positive BKV
plasmid (pRMMYBKV12, subgroup Ib) into BKV-negative pooled urine and titer verified by
using digital droplet PCR.
In total, five runs were performed with positive and negative samples in a checkerboard
configuration using one kit lot and one cobas 8800 system.
All 240 replicates of the negative sample were negative, resulting in a carry-over rate of 0%
(upper one-sided 95% confidence interval: 1.24%).

Concordance of cobas BKV with a Comparator BKV LDT
The clinical performance of the cobas BKV Urine assay was compared to the performance of a
validated, well-established laboratory developed nucleic acid test (LDT) (comparator BKV
LDT) by measuring BKV DNA levels in longitudinal clinical samples of urine specimens from
BKV-infected and non-infected patients. Contrived BKV-negative urine samples spiked with
cultured BKV virus were used to cover the linear range.
Urine specimens were collected and shipped frozen to RMS. The urine specimens were then
thawed, stabilized with cobas PCR media, aliquoted into coded tubes, randomized and tested
with cobas BKV and the comparator LDT. cobas BKV testing was performed at three sites
(two external and one internal test sites) using three kit lots per site; comparator testing was
performed at one site.
All 308 urine samples (from 84 transplant subjects) were valid on both assays and evaluable
for the clinical concordance analysis. Results presented in Table 14 demonstrate
concordance between the cobas BKV and BKV LDT ranging from between 75% to 100%
depending on the analyte concentration in the samples. The LLoQ for BKV LDT in urine
specimens was 1000 IU/mL (3 log IU/mL) and the ULoQ for BKV LDT in urine specimens
10
was 2.00E+07 IU/mL. The analytical ranges of the BKV DNA were calculated based on
standard deviation (σ = 0.15 log IU/mL) of the comparator BKV LDT (Table 14). An
10
analyte concentration of 3.0 log IU/mL represented LLoQ + 2σ, 3.3 log IU/mL
10 10
represented LLoQ + 4σ and 3.9 log IU/mL represented LLoQ + 6σ with a range interval of
10
2σ.

The rationale for adding the adjacent <LLoQ and TND cells for the TND column is that the difference between a TND and <LLoQ is
not clinically meaningful and that the lower end of the measuring range is usually more impacted by random error than the linear range
of the test.

From all samples with valid paired results within the overlapping linear range of both the
cobas BKV and the BKV LDT assay (1.0E+03 IU/mL to 2.0E+07 IU/mL), a total of 153
urine samples stabilized in cobas PCR media (from 55 out of the 84 transplant subjects) from
the three testing sites were evaluated by correlation analysis.
The 95% CI of the y-intercept for the Deming linear regression analysis did not include 0,
indicating that the results of the cobas BKV and the BKV LDT differ by a constant number
(Figure 3). This difference could be caused by differences in calibration methods (e.g., type
of quantitative calibrator, frequency of calibration) between the two tests. The 95% CIs of the
slope included 1, indicating there is no statistical evidence of proportional difference between
the two assays for all samples. The overall correlation coefficient was 0.98, indicating a
strong correlation between cobas BKV and the comparator BKV LDT.
Bias plot analysis of DNA level differences indicated a systematic difference between the
assays that is constant across the overlapping linear range. The 95% CI of the intercept of the
fitted line in the bias plots was (48.8% to 16.8%), which is within ± 0.50 log IU/mL. The
10
mean bias was estimated at 0.231 log IU/mL and the systematic difference between both
10
assays was 0.248 log IU/mL and 0.188 log IU/mL for samples with DNA levels at 4 and
10 10
7 log IU/mL, respectively. As noted in the limitations, results obtained across different
10
assays are not directly comparable due to the potential for variability in BKV DNA
measurements caused by differences in technologies, primer binding sites, specimen handling
and analytical performance. Thus, the same device should be used to manage individual
patients over the course of the disease.
