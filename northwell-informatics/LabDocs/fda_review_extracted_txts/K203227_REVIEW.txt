III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
For the in vitro quantitative determination of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in human
serum and plasma. The Elecsys HCG STAT immunoassay is intended for use in the early
detection of pregnancy.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys HCG STAT is an immunoassay that uses antibodies labeled with ruthenium
complex consist of a chimeric construct from human and mouse specific components.
The reagent working solutions include:
Rack Pack (kit placed on the analyzer).
• M Streptavidin-coated microparticles (transparent cap), 1 bottle, 6.5 mL: Streptavidin-
coated microparticles 0.72 mg/mL; preservative.
• R1 Anti-hCG-Ab~biotin (gray cap), 1 bottle, 9 mL: Biotinylated monoclonal anti‑hCG
antibody (mouse) 2.3 mg/L; phosphate buffer 40 mmol/L, pH 7.5; preservative.
• R2 Anti-hCG-Ab~Ru(bpy)23+ (black cap), 1 bottle, 10 mL:Monoclonal anti‑hCG
antibody (mouse) labeled with ruthenium complex 6.0 mg/L; phosphate buffer 40
mmol/L, pH 6.5; preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
The Elecsys HCG STAT immunoassay uses sandwich test principle using monoclonal antibodies
specifically directed against Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG). During a 9-minute
incubation, hCG present in the sample reacts with biotinylated monoclonal hCG‑specific
antibody and streptavidin‑coated microparticles to form a sandwich immune complex, which is
bound to the solid phase. The reaction mixture is aspirated into a measuring cell where the
microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances
are then removed. Application of a voltage to the electrode induces chemiluminescent emission
which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined via a calibration curve.

2. Linearity:
Linearity testing was performed with one reagent lot tested on one cobas e 601 analyzer with
one run. One human serum sample with high analyte content above the measuring range was
diluted to the lower end of the measuring range with various amounts of human serum
sample without analyte content. The dilution series contained 21 steps and included
concentrations between 0.25 and 11,411 mIU/mL. Samples were assayed in three replicates.

Linear, quadratic and cubic regression analyses were performed. The results of the linear
regression analysis are provided below.
y = 0.997 * x -0.492, r2: 0.9977
The results support the claimed analytical measurement range of 1.0 to 10,000 mIU/mL.
Auto Dilution:
Verification studies were performed to determine the sample dilution recovery of the Elecsys
HCG STAT immunoassay. HCG free human serum was spiked with WHO HCG standard
material (6th standard). These samples were automatically diluted (1:100) by the instrument,
the obtained value was multiplied by 100 and the ratio of the theoretical value and the
obtained value multiplied by 100 was generated.
The results are summarized in the tables below.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
High Dose Hook Effect
The high-dose hook effect of the Elecsys HCG STAT assay was assessed with one reagent
lot on one cobas e 601 analyzer in one-fold determination. Three (3) human serum samples
were spiked with analyte (HCG) to achieve high HCG concentrations. No Hook effect was
observed up to ≥ 500,000 mIU/mL of HCG.
Endogenous interference
Native human serum sample pools at three (~4 , ~3000, and 9000 mIU/mL) concentrations of
hCG were tested using one reagent lot. Test samples spiked with endogenous substance and
control samples with no endogenous substance were measured and compared. There was no
significant interference (< ± 10% bias between test sample and control sample) up to the
concentrations shown in the table below.

Cross-reactivity
Cross-reactivity of the Elecsys HCG STAT assay was determined with one reagent lot on
one cobas e 601 analyzer using a human serum sample with ~4.7 mIU/mL hCG. Samples
were spiked with the following potential cross-reactants: luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH), or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Samples with and
without the potential cross-reactants were measured and cross reactivity was calculated. No
cross-reactivity was observed for TSH up to 2,000 mIU/mL and FSH up to 4,000 mIU/mL.
Cross reactivity for LH in the presence of hCG was found to be dependent upon LH
concentration, as shown in the table below:

Biotin Interference
Biotin interference was tested using the Elecsys HCG STAT on a cobas e 601 analyzer and
three serum samples containing hCG (4.5 mIU/mL, 3,000 mIU/mL, and 10,000 mIU/mL).
Test samples spiked with biotin up to 3600 ng/mL and control samples with no biotin were
measured and compared. There was no significant interference (< ± 10% bias between test
sample and control sample) observed for biotin concentrations up to 3600 ng/mL.
Common drugs interference
Potential interference from drugs was determined by comparing values obtained from serum
samples containing hCG concentrations near 5 mIU/mL and near 50 mIU/mL. Test samples
spiked with each of 17 common pharmaceutical compounds were measured and compared
with the control sample (no interferent). There was no significant interference (< ± 10% bias
between the test sample and the control sample) up to the concentrations illustrated below.

For the determination of LoQ, 2 lots were evaluated, each with 5 human serum samples
covering the range between 0.57 and 1.8 mIU/mL. Each sample was measured in 5 replicates
with one run per day over 5 days on one cobas e 601 analyzer. The results support the
claimed LoQ of 1 mIU/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not Applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study between the candidate Elecsys HCG STAT assay and the
predicate device, Elecsys HCG STAT assay (k002148), was conducted internally using both
the predicate and candidate assays on the cobas e 601 analyzer. One hundred thirty-one (131)
samples spanning the range between 1.32 mIU/mL and 9848 mIU/mL were tested with one
run per sample. Passing-Bablok regression analysis of the results is provided below.
Passing/Bablok regression analysis
N 131
Range Tested (predicate) 1.32 – 9848 mIU/mL
Slope 1.012 (95% CI: 1.010, 1.014)
Intercept -0.970 mIU/mL (95% CI: -2.69, -0.2)
Correlation coefficient r 1.000
2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed to evaluate matrices suitable for use with the
Elecsys HCG STAT assay. Native human serum samples drawn into serum primary tubes
(reference) were compared to matched Li-Heparin, K2-EDTA or K3-EDTA plasma samples.
The samples were run on the cobas e 601 analyzer. The results were assessed using
Passing/Bablok regression analysis.
