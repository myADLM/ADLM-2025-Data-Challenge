Materials required, but not provided:
Bladder EpiCheck software (P/N NX899090-03C).
B. Principle of Operation
A voided urine specimen is centrifuged, and the cells (both normal and cancerous if present) are
separated from the urine supernatant. DNA is then extracted from the cell pellet using the Bladder
EpiCheck Extraction kit (P/N NX899090-01C). The extracted DNA is digested using a
methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme mix, which cleaves DNA at specific recognition sequences
if they are unmethylated. Methylated DNA is protected from enzymatic digestion and therefore
remains intact.
Real-Time PCR Amplification
DNA methylation refers to the covalent addition of methyl (CH ) groups to the C5 position of the
3
pyrimidine ring of cytosines, typically in a CpG dinucleotide, of which there are approximately 28
million in the human haploid genome. The covalent addition of a methyl group occurs generally in
cytosine within CpG dinucleotides, which are concentrated in large clusters called CpG islands.
The Bladder EpiCheck Test consists of a panel of 15 novel DNA methylation biomarkers. The
Bladder EpiCheck Test differentiates between methylated and non-methylated DNA using Real-
Time PCR amplification, creating a unique platform for methylation profiling of urine specimens
towards the detection of bladder cancer recurrence in patients previously diagnosed with the disease.
In cancer, tumor cells are characterized by genome-wide changes in methylation, with some CpG
islands undergoing de novo methylation, and several non-CpG island regions becoming
demethylated.
Using reagents provided in the Bladder EpiCheck Test kit, the digested DNA samples and test
controls are mixed together with PCR primers and probe into 8 unique PCR multiplexes reactions
and assayed using the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR system. The panel of 15 biomarkers is
amplified according to their residual levels of methylation. Real-time PCR amplification is
performed in a 96-well plate, requires 2 assay-control samples (Undigested Control and No
Template Control) and can test up to 10 patient samples. Each sample is analyzed in 8 wells,
corresponding to a single column of the plate. In each well, 3-4 biomarkers are amplified. The panel
of 15 biomarkers are used to determine whether a sample is bladder cancer positive or bladder

cancer negative. In addition, 3 internal controls (Internal Reference, Digestion Control, and
Digestion Control Reference) are used to verify successful digestion and amplification processes.
Data Analysis
The Bladder EpiCheck software (P/N NX899090-03C) accepts as an input (Source File) the *.SDS
output file of the ABI7500 DX real-time PCR machine, and outputs for each patient’s sample a
qualitative diagnosis (positive/negative for recurrence of bladder cancer) based on the patient’s
EpiScore. The software implements the Bladder EpiCheck algorithm, which starts from the raw
fluorescence data of the real-time PCR run and ends in the diagnosis (positive/negative) of each
patient. The software enables the operator, who is running the test, to view and export reports of
each patient, as well as to view the raw data of the real-time PCR run. The Bladder EpiCheck
software is installed on a stand-alone PC; it does not require web connection. The software setup
installs 3rd-party specific templates, which contain all required data and steps for the PCR run on the
ABI 7500 Dx Real-time PCR machine. The user only needs to input the sample's IDs in the third-
party software and upload the output file once the PCR run is completed. The Bladder EpiCheck
software then parses the source file, and translates its content to a unified internal format, Nucleix
Real-time Information XML (NRIX). Once in NRIX format, the Bladder EpiCheck algorithm
processes the signals, while removing background noise and anomalies, and interpolates the distinct
cycle data. The algorithm identifies the sample’s well location (controls and test) and validates their
raw data and each calculation steps against predefined thresholds. Once the algorithm run is
completed, the EpiScore and diagnosis are assigned to each sample unless an error occurred at any
of the calculation steps. The software’s user interface is designed to clearly correlate between the
sample’s location and their test results. A simple color-coded scheme separates between negative,
positive, or invalid results and from clinical samples and kit control samples (UC and NTC). Per
sample view is also available to see the sample's fluorescence signals, a sigmoid-like amplification
curve for each marker. The patient's qualitative results and the overall run summary report can be
viewed in the software’s user interface and exported as PDF file
Controls
The following controls were designed to ensure the proper performance of the test:
IR (Internal Reference)
This is an internal control that does not contain a restriction site of the digestion enzyme, and
therefore, is not affected by digestion. This marker is included in each well and serves as an internal
control for the success of the amplification in that well, specifically that there was an adequate
amount of DNA. If the amplification of the IR control fails in one or more of a sample’s wells,
analysis of the sample will not be performed, and the software will provide an "invalid" indication.
DC (Digestion Control) and DCR (Digestion Control Reference)
These are non-genomic internal controls that are located on exogenous DNA sequences. After DNA
extraction, the DC and DCR fragments are added to each DNA sample and are used to verify that
the digestion of the sample was successful. The DCR fragment does not contain a restriction site,
while the DC fragment does contain a restriction site. If digestion is successful, the DCR marker is
expected to be amplified successfully, while the DC marker is expected to be digested and therefore
not be amplified (or be amplified with low efficiency).
NTC (No template control)

--- Page 6 ---
This control contains ultra-pure water (DNA free) to be used for the NTC reaction, which assesses
potential contamination during assay setup.
UC (Undigested control)
This is an external control that contains 17 exogenous sequences that represent the entire Bladder
EpiCheck panel of biomarkers (except DCR which is added in the digestion step). These exogenous
sequences are designed to be protected from restriction, and therefore, will result a high signal
intensity at the PCR stage. The purpose of this sample is to verify that all primers and probes of the
PCR mixes, as well as the instrument detectors, are working properly.
Result Reporting
The Bladder EpiCheck Test Kit is used to calculate the associated methylation level for each of the
15 biomarkers based on the associated Cq (Cycle of quantitation, which is the PCR cycle at which
the marker’s amplification curve reached a predefined signal threshold). These methylation levels
are translated to marker scores that are based on reference methylation levels obtained from a large
set of bladder cancer negative and positive patients. These 15 marker scores are then combined into
a single number: the EpiScore, a number between 0 and 100 representing the overall methylation
level of the sample at the panel biomarkers. The resulting EpiScore is then compared to a pre-
specified threshold; if it is above or equal to the threshold (60), the test is called “Positive”;
otherwise, it is called “Negative”.
If the sample analysis is failed (e.g., insufficient DNA, incomplete digestion) or the analysis of the
entire PCR plate failed (e.g., one of the plate controls failed), the output for the sample will be
“Invalid”. In some cases of failure, the sample/plate run may be repeated a second time, and in other
cases the user will be instructed to collect a new sample from the patient.

1. Precision/Reproducibility
Precision and reproducibility for the Bladder EpiCheck® Test were evaluated across 3 different
studies: laboratory-to-laboratory, operator-to-operator/day-to-day, and lot-to-lot/instrument-to-
instrument. Between-site, between-operator, between-run, between-day, within-run, and
between-lot precision were assessed.
Laboratory-to-Laboratory
A laboratory-to-laboratory repeatability and reproducibility study was performed to assess
variation of Bladder EpiCheck when performed in 3 different laboratories by 2 operators at each
laboratory site over 3 non-consecutive run days using contrived human DNA samples. Six (6)
contrived human DNA samples were created by blending gDNA from different sample sources
(commercially available gDNA, gDNA from T24 cell line, and gDNA derived from healthy
donor urine pools) to represent different Bladder EpiCheck marker combinations and to
represent four different EpiScore categories, including scores around the test cutoff (high
negative and low positive). These 6 samples were tested in technical duplicates at 2 different
inputs (Low = 4ng/PCR; High = 10ng/PCR). The sample representation is shown in Table 3
below.

A total number of 4 replicates were analyzed per panel member (24 replicates per operator per
day) for a total of 144 measurements per laboratory (432 total measurements). Agreement
between EpiCheck status and true status call (positive/negative) was calculated. Acceptance
criteria was an overall agreement of 95%, with a positive/negative agreement (PPA/NPA) for
each unique sample of 90% across all sites. The data demonstrated an overall performance of
99.31%, as well as an overall agreement above 90% for all 3 laboratory sites. Precision was also
evaluated by EpiScore value, which further demonstrated the overall reproducibility of the
Bladder EpiCheck assay.
Overall performance characteristics (agreement, PPA, and NPA) are shown in Tables 4, 5, and
6 below, with EpiScore results shown in Table 7. There were no control (plate) failures (0/54),
and overall invalid rate was 0.2% (1/433; 95% CI 0.05%; 1.03%).

An additional laboratory-to-laboratory reproducibility study, using clinical samples, was
performed at 3 laboratories to determine precision between laboratories. Four clinical samples
were used to represent Low Negative (LN; ES ~20), High Negative (HN; ES~45), Low Positive
(HP; ES~75), and High Positive (HP; ES~90) at 2 DNA input levels. One operator ran the test
at each laboratory location on 3 different, non-consecutive workdays with an interval of at least
3 days between runs. A single reagent lot was used for this study. On each day of testing, each
operator ran 4 unique clinical samples at 2 DNA concentration levels with the low DNA
concentration representing a concentration close to the assay cut-off. A total of 12 replicates per
sample per site were tested (48 per laboratory, 144 total measurements). Acceptance criteria
was an overall (positive/negative) level of agreement of 95%. The data demonstrated an overall
performance of 96.5%. Precision was also evaluated by EpiScore value, which further
demonstrated the overall reproducibility of the Bladder EpiCheck assay. Overall performance
characteristics (agreement, PPA, and NPA) are described in Table 9 and 10 below, with
EpiScore results shown in Table 11. There were no control (plate) failures (0/18).

*All samples except the High Negative had 100% agreement with the Expected Result. However, these discordances occurred
across all 3 sites uniformly and across both DNA concentrations, and this category of sample is incredibly rare (~ 4.5% of the
sample population), so the risk of a false positive result would be ~1%.
Operator-to-Operator/Day-to-Day
An operator-to-operator and day-to-day repeatability and reproducibility study was performed
at single site to assess the intra-run (within-run), inter-run (between-run), and inter-operator
(between- operator) variation of Bladder EpiCheck when performed by 2 different operators
over 5 non-consecutive days. Healthy donor urine pools were spiked with bladder cancer-
derived cell line material at different input levels to formulate 4 test samples spanning the
measurable range of EpiScore values (LN, HN, LP, and HP) tested in 5 replicates per sample
(20 replicates per day per operator, for a total of 200 replicates). Acceptance criteria was an
overall (positive/negative) level of agreement of 95% across all operators and days. The data
demonstrated a 99.0% agreement, overall and across all operators and days. Precision was also
evaluated by EpiScore value, which further demonstrated the overall reproducibility of the
Bladder EpiCheck assay. Overall performance characteristics (agreement, PPA, and NPA) are
summarized in Tables 13, 14, and 15 below, with EpiScore results shown in Table 16. There
were no invalid results and 1 control (plate) failure out of 21 plates (1/21 = 4.8% [95% CI 1.1%;
18.8%]).

Lot-to-Lot/Instrument-to-Instrument
A lot-to-lot and instrument-to-instrument repeatability and reproducibility study was performed
at a single site to assess the variability of Bladder EpiCheck when performed using 3 unique kit
lots and 3 unique PCR instruments. Healthy donor urine pools were spiked with bladder cancer-
derived cell line material at different DNA concentration levels to create 4 test samples
spanning the range of EpiScore values (LN, HN, LP, and HP). A minimum of 70 replicates
were tested for each sample. Acceptance criteria was an overall level of agreement
(positive/negative) greater than 90% with 95% confidence. The data demonstrated and overall
agreement of 100.0%. Precision was also evaluated by EpiScore value, which further
demonstrated the overall reproducibility of the Bladder EpiCheck assay. Overall agreement is
summarized in Table 18 below, with EpiScore results shown in Table 19.

2. DNA Extraction Efficiency
A total of 47 clinical urine specimens, collected from bladder cancer patients and healthy
donors, were used for this study. Each specimen was pelleted, split into 10mL urine equivalents,
and DNA was extracted from each split specimen using 4 Bladder EpiCheck Extraction lots.
Performance of the Bladder EpiCheck kits was evaluated by invalid rate and Bladder EpiCheck
test performance and tested in the Bladder EpiCheck test using one ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-
Time PCR system and analyzed using Bladder EpiCheck software (Ver. 1.9.19). Sample Failure
and Agreement between lots are shown in Tables 20 and 21, respectively. In summary, a total of
1 sample failed after extraction, leading to an overall sample failure rate of 2.1%, and study
results showed an overall, positive, and negative agreement of 100%.

3. Clinical Cut-off
The Bladder EpiCheck test software translates the marker score of the 15 Bladder EpiCheck
markers into an integrated score called EpiScore, ranging from 0-100. An EpiScore result of 0-
59 represents a negative test result for bladder cancer recurrence, and an EpiScore result of 60-
100 represents a positive test result for bladder cancer recurrence.
4. Analytical Sensitivity
Limit of Blank
A Limit of Blank study was conducted to determine the residual levels of non-specific
background signal in the absence of template DNA. Sixty (60) replicates of no-template control
(without DNA) were tested across 2 reagent lots – a total of 120 test results. Mean Cq results
were 44.75 and 44.86 for Lots 1 and 2, respectively. Using a non-parametric approach, the
resulting LoB was determined to be a Cq value equal to 45.
Functional LoD (fLoD)
The functional Limit of Detection (fLoD) refers to the lowest total DNA that is required for the
assay and was determined by testing DNA extracted from positive clinical specimens mixed
with DNA extracted from pooled healthy individuals (negative clinical specimens) to create a
clinical specimen with an EpiScore near the clinical cutoff (Low Positive). This sample was
tested across a range of 5 concentrations (two-fold dilutions) around and below the assay cut-off
(1.2 ng/well, 0.65 ng/well, 0.30 ng/well, 0.15 ng/well, and 0.075 ng/well). A blank sample (0
ng/well) was also tested. Each concentration was tested in replicates of 30 using one lot of
reagents and one instrument – a total of 330 test measurements. The fLoD was determined from
a PROBIT regression model as the concentration at which, with 95% probability and 90% CI,
the measurement result yielded a “positive” classification. Hit Rate and PROBIT results are
summarized in Tables 22 and 23, respectively. Using this approach, the estimated fLoD was
determined to be 0.186 ng/well (2.23 ng/sample).

Tumor Limit of Detection (tLoD)
The Tumor Limit of Detection (tLoD) refers to the minimum amount of tumor DNA in the
lowest total volume of DNA that can be detected and was determined by testing DNA extracted
from bladder cancer positive patient specimens and mixing with DNA extracted from healthy
urine donor samples in a ratio gradient of 7 positive DNA spike-in levels (50%, 30%, 20%,
15%, 12%, 8%, and 4%). These samples were tested using 2 reagent lots in 30 replicates total.
Samples with 100% and 0% positive DNA spike-ins were also tested, but only in 10 replicates
total. For each sample type, positive and negative DNA pools were mixed at different ratios to
create a series of samples ranging from 0 to 100% tumor DNA. The total DNA concentration
was kept constant at 1-2x the functional LoD (fLoD). The tLoD was calculated from a PROBIT
regression model as the concentration at which with 95% probability the measurement result
yields a “positive” classification. Hit rate and PROBIT estimation results are summarized in
Tables 24 and 25, respectively. Based on this model, the tLoD was determined to be 7.5%,
which equates to a minimum amount of tumor DNA in a clinical sample of ~0.17 ng.

Methylation Limit of Detection (MLoD)
The Methylation Limit of Detection (mLoD) refers to the minimal detectable level of
methylation across the assay’s target loci and was determined using a mixture of methylated
and unmethylated artificial plasma DNA to create a gradient of different levels of methylation.
This study took place across 2 phases, performed using contrived DNA samples. The MLoD
was determined to be 0.35%.
In Study 1 (Phase I), a preliminary mLoD was established using a single PCR mix (Mix A,
which consisted of biomarkers BE-1 and BE-2), as it represented the lower end of the

0.1%, 0.05%, 0.025%, and 0.01%), along with a 0% methylation sample, were tested using one
reagent lot and between 16 and 60 replicates, depending on the methylation level – a total of
378 total measurements. Undigested 100% methylated UC was also run as a positive control.
Hit rate and PROBIT results for both biomarkers are summarized in Tables 26 and 27,
respectively. Based on interpolation from the PROBIT estimation, the higher of the two mLoD
values was used as the preliminary mLoD: 0.348%.

7. Stability
Real-Time (Shelf-Life) and In-Use
In-use and real-time stability testing of 3 lots of the Bladder EpiCheck kit stored at the
recommended storage condition of -20°C/2-8°C/25°C (depending on the reagents storage
specifications) were conducted at six separate time points (baseline, 90 days, 180 days, 365
days, 440 days, and 540 days). Baseline for each lot was performed within 1 month of the kit
manufacturing date and served as a reference for the subsequent time points for both in-use and
real-time stability protocols. Each lot was tested using 4 contrived urine pools (T24 cell line
DNA spiked into DNA extracted from healthy volunteer urine pools) representing the full range
of EpiScore values (LN, HN, LP, and HP) tested in 7 replicates at each timepoint. For the in-
use stability assessment, during each time point, all kits from the same lot (n=3) underwent the
same freeze/thaw and handling procedures. For real-time stability assessment, at each time
point, “fresh” (unused) Extraction and test kits were used. Each “run” included the Undigested
(UC) and Non-Template (NTC) Controls. For T=0, a total of 84 samples were tested (4 sample
pools tested in each of 3 kit lots in replicates of 7). For T=1 through T=5, a total of 168 samples
were testes (4 samples pools tested in each of 3 kit lots in replicates of 7 spanning both studies).
Results showed that there was no significant change in performance when testing kits and
controls up to 486 days. Overall agreement was 99.68% [99.19%; 99.87%]), thus supporting the
stability claim of 486 days.

Freeze-Thaw
Freeze/Thaw stability testing of three lots of the Bladder EpiCheck Test kit stored at the
recommended storage condition of -20°C was conducted at three separate test points (T = 1, 8
and 12 cycles). Each lot was tested using 4 contrived urine pools (T24 cell line DNA spiked
into DNA extracted from healthy volunteer urine pools) representing the full range of EpiScore
values (LN, HN, LP, and HP) with 5 replicates per sample. Results showed no significant
performance changes and low variability in EpiScore value between the 3 timepoints. The
stability claim of 10 cycles was then confirmed in a supplementary study using 4 clinical
samples representing the full range of EpiScore values (LN, HN, LP, and HP) with 5 replicates
per sample over 2 timepoints (1 cycle and 12 cycles).
Shipping
Twelve (12) Extraction Kit boxes and 12 Test kit boxes were used to evaluate the packing
tolerance due to transportation. From the 12 boxes, two boxes were used to evaluate the
functionality of the kits (i.e., extracting DNA and prepare the DNA for the PCR analysis) and to
test the performance of the kit (quantitative and qualitative results) across a variety of simulated
transportation conditions (changes in temperature for 24 hours, vibration, pressure, and drop
tolerance). Simulated conditions and durations are listed in Table 29. In addition, a single
control box that did not go through any transportation simulation was used as control. The
performance of the kit was tested on urine samples collected from 8 subjects (4 healthy and 4
Bladder Cancer). Each sample was tested in five replicates by the kits underwent the
transportation analysis (n=40) and in duplicate by the control kit (n=16). Overall, Positive, and
Negative agreement were 100%.

8. Analytical Specificity
Digestion Restriction Efficiency
Digestion restriction efficiency was established by evaluating the digestion of all 15 Bladder
EpiCheck markers using 100% unmethylated synthetic (plasmid) DNA tested across a series of
dilution levels for a total of 30 replicates based on the relationship of the ΔCq between the non-
digestible IR marker (100% copies in the reaction) and digested targets (BE markers 1-15).
Digestion efficiency for all 15 markers was shown to exceed 99.9%, with an average efficiency
of 99.997%.
An additional study was performed to assess the impact of hemi-methylated molecules have on
the enzymatic digestion step, as well as the contamination risk, in the Bladder EpiCheck assay
protocol performed using synthetic DNA molecules of a representative locus (BE-14)
containing all different permutations of the targeted cut site. Results showed that hemi-
methylated DNA does represent a digestion efficiency profile similar to unmethylated DNA;
however, at best, this reflects a very small sub-population of target molecules, so the effect
should be negligible.
Digestion Restriction Efficiency – Exclusivity
Digestion restriction efficiency (Exclusivity) was established by evaluating the digestion of
nonmethylated markers to avoid false positive results using a commercially available hypo-
methylated human genomic DNA sample (<5% average global methylation), which was added
to the digestion reaction at an extreme excess (2.5ug/reaction), and tested in 10 replicates (with
6 replicates of a control reaction with no digestion enzyme to reflect the full amplification
between test and control markers). The efficacy of the digestion was calculated per marker, by
the ΔCq between the digested (test) and non-digested (control) markers. The digestion
efficiency was greater than 99% for 9 of the 15 biomarkers, ensuring that no non-specific signal
is generated in the qPCR step.
A supplementary meta-analysis was conducted to demonstrate that each of the 15 Bladder
EpiCheck markers can be digested at or above the 99.9% level. Raw data from 2,300 clinical
specimens from US and European cohorts (including a wide range of methylation levels at all
15 loci) was analyzed, and max digestion was determined for each biomarker. The max
digestion percentage was >99.99% for all 15 biomarkers, thus further ensuring that no non-
specific signal is generated in the qPCR step.
Primer Probe Specificity
In-Silico PCR analysis for each locus (Informative markers BE-1 to BE-15 and the Internal
Reference (IR)) obtained a single hit using the forward and reverse primer sequences.
Additionally, confirmatory PCR was performed using each primer pair, followed by gel
electrophoresis. This showed only one product amplified per primer pair, this confirming the
in-silico analysis.
Interference
Performance of Bladder EpiCheck was evaluated with 27 potentially interfering substances
(including common urine constituents, microbial contaminants, therapeutic agents, and

--- Page 31 ---
laboratory preservatives) tested across 3 contrived sample pools (2 negative pools from healthy
individuals, and one positive pool of healthy urine spiked with bladder cancer cell-line
material). Each substance was tested at 2 concentrations, with each test run in 3 replicates (18
total replicates for negative sample pools, 9 total replicates for positive sample pool). Any
invalid or failed samples were repeated. Preliminary results (Table 30) suggested that uric acid
and ampicillin were both potential interferents, so a dose response analysis was conducted,
which showed that interference either did not repeat itself or was present at elevated levels that
are not clinically meaningful. Therefore, no evidence of interference caused by the substances
tested at clinically relevant physiological ranges exists.

9. Specimen Stability
Thirty (30) Clinical specimens, collected from 15 bladder cancer patients and 15 normal donors
across the full range of EpiScore values, were divided into 3 parts and used to evaluate the
stability of fresh urine, urine pellet, and extracted DNA and digested DNA. Samples ranged
from low negative through high positive. Each sample was tested immediately and after storage.
Each clinical sample was divided into different aliquots and tested at 3 timepoints depending on
the specimen type (Fresh urine: 0, 5, and 6 days; Pelleted urine: 0, 14, and 21 days; DNA: 0, 30,
and 60 days) after storage at the recommended conditions. Agreement results are shown in
Tables 31, 32, and 33 for urine, pelleted urine, and DNA, respectively. The results confirm a
stability claim of 5 days for fresh urine at 2-8ºC, urine pellets for 19 days at -20ºC, and DNA for
30 days at -20ºC.
Two supplementary studies were conducted to assess the stability of digested DNA using
residual clinical specimens stored for > 1 year (Study 1, n=25) and clinical specimens stored for
30 days prior to testing (Study 2, n=48). Agreement results are shown in Table 34. The results
showed an overall agreement of 100% for both sets of samples, confirming a frozen stability
claim of 30 days for digested DNA.

10. Robustness
Robustness of the Bladder EpiCheck was evaluated using four (4) contrived specimens (T24
cell line DNA spiked into DNA extracted from healthy volunteer urine pools) representing the
full range of EpiScore values (LN, HN, LP, and HP). Each sample was run in quintuplicates
across a series of 13 conditions with to variations in the optimized PCR run conditions was
evaluated under different assay conditions. The conditions deviated from the recommended
condition specified in the Instructions for Use into either digestion or PCR stage including PCR
denaturation and annealing temperatures, digestion temperature, and/or digestion time. Four
clinical DNA sample pools, representing different EpiScore values, were analyzed in each
condition. Overall agreement was shown to be 98.599% [96.77%; 99.31%].
A supplementary study was conducted to further demonstrate the robustness of the Bladder
EpiCheck assay using 4 clinical specimens (DNA extracted from clinical specimens adjusted
using DNA extracted from healthy urine donor pools) that represent the full range of EpiScore
values (LN, HN, LP, and HP). Each sample was tested in quintuplicates across 5 different
assay conditions (including the control condition). Overall agreement was shown to be 99.3%
[96.9%; 99.8%], thus confirming the robustness of the assay.
B. Clinical Performance
1. Clinical Cutoff (Training and Feasibility Data)
The assay cut-off and proprietary EpiScore algorithm for the Bladder EpiCheck software were
validated on a set of urine samples collected from control patients with a history of bladder
cancer and bladder cancer positive patients confirmed by cystoscopy and pathology. The total
sample size for the software algorithm development included 178 samples, which were
collected in two separate sets. The first set of samples served for the cut-off definition (n=109,
of which 40 were collected from control patients with a history of bladder cancer and 69 from
Urothelial Cell Carcinoma (UCC) positive patients confirmed by pathology). The second
sample set served as the validation of the cut-off (n=67, of which 51 were collected from
control patients with a history of bladder cancer and 16 from UCC positive patients confirmed
by pathology). The derived Bladder EpiCheck algorithm sensitivity and specificity compared to
pathology outcome demonstrated a sensitivity of 94% for UCC recurrence and specificity of
84%.

2. Method Comparison
A multi-center, prospective, IRB-approved longitudinal study was conducted at 11 academic
and urology specialty medical centers in the U.S. and Canada to establish the performance of
Bladder EpiCheck as compared to the predicate device (UroVysion Bladder Cancer Recurrence
Kit). Performance of the Bladder EpiCheck was also assessed against a “gold standard” (GS)
derived using both clinical cytology and combined cystoscopy/pathology data.
A total of 674 subjects were enrolled in the study. Demographic and disease history for enrolled
subjects are listed in Table 35. Eligible subjects included any male or female subject aged 22
and above, diagnosed with incident or recurrent UCC and undergoing surveillance for bladder
cancer recurrence, who had urothelial cell carcinoma tumor resected within 12 months from
baseline visit, and had a plan for cystoscopy surveillance. The study included up to 3 visits:
baseline, and up to 2 additional surveillance visits, where voided urine specimens were
collected. In total, voided urine specimens were collected from 583 subjects. For subjects who
experienced a recurrence (as determined by positive cytology/pathology), the first positive visit
was used (i.e., the visit at which the diagnosis of recurrence was established). For the non-
recurring subjects, the last negative visit was used for subjects with multiple surveillance visits.

DNA extracted from urine specimens was tested using the Bladder EpiCheck device and
compared to the GS. Classification by the GS was as follows: a subject was considered positive
if the interpretation for either cytology or the combined cystoscopy/pathology results were
positive, and a subject was considered negative if both cytology and the combined
cystoscopy/pathology results were negative. Equivocal cytology was also considered negative.
A detailed description of how GS status was determined can be found in Table 36. In total,
valid Bladder EpiCheck and GS results were obtained from 449 samples. In summary, the
Bladder EpiCheck test performed with an overall accuracy of 78.8% (95% CI [74.8%; 82.4%]),
a sensitivity of 66.7% ([58.4%; 74.0%]), and a specificity of 84.2% ([79.8%; 87.9%]). Further
details of the performance characteristics of the Bladder EpiCheck test compared to the
established GS is found in Table 37. Additionally, performance of the Bladder EpiCheck test
was evaluated in several subgroup analyses shown in Tables 38 (Cancer Grade) and 39 (Cancer
Stage), whose results were comparable to the overall performance characteristics.

3. Comparison to UroVysion
DNA extracted from urine specimens was tested using the Bladder EpiCheck device and
compared to the predicate device (UroVysion Bladder Cancer Recurrence Kit) with respect to
the GS sample definition. In total, valid Bladder EpiCheck, UroVysion, and GS results were
obtained from 352 samples. In summary, the Bladder EpiCheck was slightly more sensitive
(+4.82%) and slightly less specific (-2.97%) than the predicate device; thus, the Bladder
EpiCheck is substantially equivalent to the predicate device. Further details of the performance
characteristics between the Bladder EpiCheck test and the predicate device are listed in Table
40. An additional analysis was performed by cancer grade (Table 41).

4. Specificity in Urology Patients without Bladder Cancer
A multi-center, prospective study was conducted to establish the specificity of Bladder
EpiCheck test in urology patients without prior history or clinical evidence of bladder cancer.
One-hundred forty- seven (147) subjects aged 22 and above, visiting the urology clinic for any
non-bladder cancer disorders. Subjects were excluded from the study if they had known current
or prior diagnosis of both invasive and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The specificity of
Bladder EpiCheck in this study population was 98.0%. Covariates analysis by sex, age group,
ethnicity, race, smoking status, reason for visit at clinic, non-cancer genitourinary disease type,
presence of hematuria, BPH, UTI and STD were performed. No statistical significance was
found, indicating that there was no impact of any of the tested covariates on the applicability of
the primary analysis results on the population tested.
5. Specificity – Cross-Reactivity with Other Cancers
The effect of potential cross-reactivity was assessed using banked remnant de-identified urine
samples collected from patients diagnosed with different types of cancers, specifically cancers
that are more likely to shed cancer cells into the bladder such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and
prostate cancer as well as other solid and hematology cancer. One-hundred forty-seven urine
samples were assessed. The most frequent cancer category was genitourinary, with 54 subjects
(37%) including prostate and renal cell carcinoma, followed by gastrointestinal with 26 subjects

(7%). 42 subjects (29%) had other solid cancer types. The study population had a mean age of
65 years old (ranging from 27 to 89) with a similar rate of sexes. Nearly all subjects were non-
smokers or former smokers, with 12% current smokers. In this study, the specificity was found
to be 95% (140/147: Prostate (3), RCC (2), Uterine (1), pancreas (1)) (95% confidence interval
of 90.4%-98.1%), confirming the specificity of Bladder EpiCheck in patients with cancer other
than bladder cancer.
