IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Atlas Link Technology Co., Ltd.’s One Step hCG Urine Pregnancy Test will be sold in three
formats: Strip, Cassette, and Midstream. Each format of the device contains mouse monoclonal
anti- β hCG antibody colloidal gold conjugate pre-dried on a pad. Mouse monoclonal anti α hCG
antibodies (on test region) and goat anti-mouse IgG (on control region) are coated and
immobilized on a membrane.
B Principle of Operation:
Atlas One Step Urine Pregnancy Test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the
qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin in urine to aid in early detection of
pregnancy. The assay is based on an immunochromatographic technology. Each test device
contains monoclonal anti-β hCG antibody colloidal gold conjugate pre-dried on a pad.
Monoclonal anti-α hCG antibodies (on the test region) and goat anti mouse IgG (on the control
region) are coated and immobilized on a membrane. As the urine sample contacts the membrane,
it dissolves the lyophilized conjugate. In a reactive sample, the hCG antigen will attach to the
anit-β hCG monoclonal antibodies in the colloidal solution. If hCG is present in the sample, it
will reach the test zone (“T”) of the membrane and form a pink line. In addition, all samples will
cause a pink colored line to appear in the control zone (“C”). This line is formed by the binding
of the polyclonal antibodies (Anti-mouse IgG) affixed onto the control zone to the sample-
colloidal gold conjugate. Presence of this line indicates sufficient sample volume was added.

2. Linearity:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
For all analytical specificity testing, the Atlas One Step hCG Urine Pregnancy Test Strip,
Atlas One Step hCG Urine Pregnancy Test Cassette, and Atlas One Step hCG Urine
Pregnancy Test Midstream devices were evaluated. Three lots of each device format were
used in all studies.
Cross-reactivity:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate potential cross-reactivity from LH, FSH and TSH.
Normal, nonpregnant female urine samples containing 12.5 mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL hCG
were spiked with various concentrations of glycoprotein hormones, Luteinizing Hormone
(LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). No
interference was observed from the tested glycoprotein hormones at up to 500 mIU/mL LH,
1000 mIU/mL FSH, and 1000 mIU/mL TSH.
Interference:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate potential interference from certain exogenous
compounds. Each interfering substance was prepared by diluting stock interfering material to
the desired concentration. Normal, nonpregnant female urine samples containing 0 mIU/mL
and 25 mIU/mL hCG were spiked with the interfering substance to obtain the desired test
concentration listed in the table below. No interferences were observed from exogenous
compounds at the following concentrations for both negative and positive hCG urine
samples.
No interferences were observed from these exogenous compounds at the following
concentrations for both negative and positive hCG urine samples.

Effect of hCG beta-core fragment:
To evaluate potential interference by hCG β-core fragment, urine samples containing 12.5
mIU/mL hCG (below the 25 mIU/mL cut-off level) and 30 mIU/mL (above the 25mIU/mL
cut-off level) hCG were spiked with the hCG β-core fragment to yield samples with
concentrations of 50,000 pmol/mL, 125,000, 250,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 pmol/mL.

These samples were tested with 3 lots of each device. The data obtained demonstrated that
there is no interference by hCG β -core fragment at the concentrations tested.
Effect of urine pH:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in urine pH, urine samples containing 0
mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL hCG were tested with 3 lots of each device using samples at pH
3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0. The results demonstrated that samples
within the pH range of 3.0-10.0 do not interfere with either positive or negative results from
the device.
Specific Gravity:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, testing was performed
with negative urine sample containing 0 mIU/mL and urine sample with 25 mIU/mL hCG
were adjusted to specific gravities ranging from 1.003 to 1.050 and tested with 3 lots of
devices for each format. The results indicated that changes in specific gravity, ranging from
1.003-1.050, do not interfere in the results that were either positive or negative for hCG.
High dose hook effect study:
To evaluate high dose hook effect, hCG-free urine specimens spiked with hCG at 1,000
mIU/mL, 10,000 mIU/mL, 100,000 mIU/mL, 500,000 mIU/mL, 1,000,000 mIU/mL, and
5,000,000 mIU/mL were tested on three lots of devices for each format. The results showed
no hook effect up to 500,000 mIU/mL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The performance of the three formats- strip, cassette, and midstream (stimulated midstream)
of the One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy test was compared to the predicate device. Testing
was performed at 2 hospital sites with 150 urine samples in each site of the sites for a total of
300 samples from women between the ages of 18 to 45 who were nonpregnant, were
pregnant, experienced later periods or were ready to be pregnant. Samples were randomly
collected at various times throughout the day and were masked and randomized prior to
testing. One hundred (100) samples were tested per each format of the devices. Results of the
professional using the candidate device were compared to results obtained from the predicate
device. Summary of results is presented in the table below:
Strip format
Candidate Device Predicate device Positive Predicate device Negative
Hospital A Positive 22 0
Negative 0 28
Hospital B Positive 19 0

The result data shows that the agreement of Atlas One Step hCG Urine Pregnancy Test Strip,
Atlas One Step hCG Urine Pregnancy Test Cassette, and Atlas One Step hCG Urine
Pregnancy Test Midstream with the predicate device is 100%.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Lay-user Studies:
This study was conducted in 2 sites with 300 volunteers with varying educational
background. This included 100 lay users using test strip, 100 using test cassette, 100 using
test midstream with midstream method. Subject ages ranged from 18 to 45 years. Urine
samples from the lay-user testing were split to two groups, one group was for the lay-user
testing, and the other was for the professional testing. All samples were masked and
randomized prior to professional testing. Each subject tested their own urine specimen with
only one test method on the candidate device following the instructions on the package
insert. The same sample was tested by a healthcare professional using the predicate device.
Then the results of lay-user test were compared to results reported by a laboratory
professional.
Summary of results for the comparison between the lay user testing with the candidate device
versus the professional testing using the candidate device are presented the table below.
