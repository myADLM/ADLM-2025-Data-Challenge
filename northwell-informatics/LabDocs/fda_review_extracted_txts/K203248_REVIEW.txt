The Albumin BCG2 assay is used for the quantitation of albumin in human serum or plasma on
the ARCHITECT c System.
The Albumin BCG2 assay is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous
diseases involving primarily the liver or kidneys.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
ARCHITECT c8000 System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Albumin BCG2 Reagent Kit consists of a single reagent R1. The active ingredient is
bromocresol green at a concentration of 0.320 g/L. Inactive ingredients include sodium
hydroxide/succinic acid buffer (pH 4.2) and detergents/surfactants (1.6%). The preservative is
ProClin 300.
B Principle of Operation:
The Albumin BCG2 assay is an automated, colorimetric clinical chemistry assay. The Albumin
BCG2 procedure is based on the binding of bromocresol green in the assay reagent specifically
with albumin in the patient sample to produce a colored complex. The absorbance of the
complex at 604 nm is directly proportional to the albumin concentration in the sample.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The Albumin BCG2 assay was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3. Testing was
conducted using 3 lots of the Albumin BCG2 reagent, 3 lots of the Consolidated Chemistry
Calibrator, 1 lot of commercially available controls, and 3 instruments. Samples were
prepared by spiking pooled normal human serum to a target concentration of 0.4 g/dL, 5.9
g/L and 9.5 g/dL. The samples were tested in 2 replicates, 2 times per day, for 20 days, for a
total of 80 measurements.
Representative performance collected over 20 days using one instrument and one reagent lot
is shown in the following table.

*Includes within-run, between-run, and between-day variability.
Minimum and maximum SD or %CV across all reagent lot and instrument combinations
2. Linearity:
The linearity for the Albumin BCG2 assay was evaluated by testing twelve unique sample
levels (ranging from 0.0 – 11.6 g/dL) using 1 lot of the Albumin BCG2 reagent, 1 lot of the
Consolidated Chemistry Calibrator, 1 lot of commercially available controls on a single
instrument and a single run. Two replicates were tested per sample/pool and all replicates
were used in the analysis. The data was analyzed using linear regression as well as second
and third order non-linear fitted polynomial regression with the third order model
demonstrating the best fit. For all test samples, the absolute value of the degree of non-
linearity met the sponsor’s pre-defined acceptance criteria for deviation from linearity and
the assay was demonstrated to be linear across the claimed analytical measuring interval of
0.3 to 9.4 g/dL.

The interference was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP07-A2. Test samples were
prepared by spiking each potentially interfering substance into a pooled human serum at the
interferent level into low albumin (approximately 3.5 g/dL) and high albumin (approximately
5.0 g/dL) serum samples and analyzed 10 times. The sponsor states that interference is
considered to be non-significant if the difference between the samples with and without
interferent are less or equal to ± 10%.
The results of the highest concentration tested without significant interference are
summarized in the table below.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable and analytical measuring range of the assay is 0.3-9.4 g/dL. Samples with an
albumin value below 0.3 g/dL are reported as “< 0.3 g/dL” and samples with an albumin
value exceeding 9.4 g/dL (> 94 g/L) are flagged as "> 9.4 g/dL" ("> 94 g/L").
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability: The Albumin BCG2 assay is traceable to the ERM-DA470/IFCC standard.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) studies
were performed in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.
Limit of blank (LoB) study was performed by testing 4 blank samples (0 g/dL), using 3
reagent lots over 3 days on 2 different instruments. Each day, for each reagent lot, 5 replicate
measurements were recorded (60 results). The LoB was calculated non-parametrically at the
95th percentile for each lot. The higher LoB for both reagent lots was chosen as the assay’s
LoB.
Limit of detection (LoD) study was performed by testing 6 levels level samples using 3
reagent lots over 3 days on 2 instruments. Each day, for each reagent lot, 10 replicate
measurements were recorded (60 results per reagent lot). LoD was calculated non-
parametrically. The higher LoD of the 3 lots was chosen as the assay’s LoD.
Limit of quantitation (LoQ) study was performed using 6 low level human sera samples
measured over 3 days on 2 instruments using 3 reagent lots. Each day, for each reagent lot,
10 replicate measurements were recorded (60 results total). The sponsor defined LoQ as the
lowest concentration at which the maximum allowable precision of 20 %CV was met.
The studies supported the following detection limit claims:

LoB 0.0
LoD 0.3
LoQ 0.3

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed in which human serum samples (n=128)
spanning the analytical measuring interval of the assay (0.4-8.1 g/dL) were tested. For the
candidate device, samples were tested internally using 3 lots of reagents and 1 lot each of
calibrator and controls across 2 ARCHITECT c8000 instruments. For the predicate device,
samples were tested internally using 1 lot each of reagents, calibrator, and controls across 2
ARCHITECT c8000 instruments. Each sample was tested in a minimum of 2 replicates
using both methods and testing occurred over a minimum of 3 calendar days.
A Passing-Bablok evaluation was performed by comparing the first replicate result from the
candidate device versus the mean result from the predicate device. The study results were
considered acceptable if the subject device had a Passing-Bablok regression slope of 1.00 (±
0.08) and a correlation coefficient (r) ≥ 0.975 for samples across the analytical measuring
interval of the assay when compared to the predicate device.
The results are summarized below:
Concentration Range
Correlation
Sample n Units Intercept Slope (as measured by the
Coefficient
predicate method)
Serum 128 g/dL 1.00 0.03 1.03 0.4 – 8.1
2. Matrix Comparison with Predicate device:
A matrix comparison study was performed to evaluate plasma samples and blood collection
tube types suitable for use with the Albumin BCG2 assay. Samples containing 0.8-7.7 g/dL
albumin were obtained from 74 matched donors in the control tube type (plain serum without
serum separator tube) and in the evaluation tube types (K EDTA, lithium heparin, sodium
2
heparin, lithium heparin separator tube, and serum separator tube).
All samples were processed according to the blood collection tube manufacturer’s instructions.
The samples were evaluated on the candidate device and tested in a minimum of 2 replicates
using 1 lot of the Albumin BCG2 reagent, 1 lot of the Consolidated Chemistry Calibrator, 1 lot
of commercially available controls, and1 instrument. For the control tube type, all 3 replicates
were analyzed. For the evaluation tube types, only the 1st replicate was analyzed.
The results are shown below:
