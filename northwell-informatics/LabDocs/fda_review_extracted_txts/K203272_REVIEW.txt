B Indication(s) for Use:
The Alltest Pregnancy Rapid Combo Test Cassette is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for
the qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin in urine or serum to aid in the early
detection of pregnancy.
The test is for health care professionals use including professionals at point of care (POC).
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Alltest Pregnancy Rapid Combo Test Cassette measures the presence of the hormone
Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) in human urine or serum for the early detection of
pregnancy. The Alltest Pregnancy Rapid Combo Test is used as a single cassette device. Each
device contains a test strip that includes an absorbent pad, coated membrane, gold conjugate pad,
and sample pad.
B Principle of Operation:
The Alltest Pregnancy Rapid Combo Test is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay. When
a sample is added, the sample is absorbed into the device by capillary action and mixes with the
antibody-dye conjugate (mouse anti-beta hCG monoclonal antibody), flowing across the pre-
coated (Goat anti hCG polyclonal antibody) membrane. At analyte concentration above the
target cut off, it produces a colored test line that indicates a positive result. When analyte
concentration is below the cutoff, no colored band shows in the test region, indicating a negative
result. No line in the “C” region indicates that the test is invalid.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative test.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate potential cross-reactivity from LH, FSH and TSH.
Negative and positive samples (10 and 20 mIU/mL hCG for urine, and 5 and 10 mIU/mL hCG
for serum) were spiked with various concentrations of other glycoprotein hormones such as
LH, FSH, and TSH. Samples were tested using three device lots of by three operators. No
interference was observed for these samples for the device at LH concentrations up to 500
IU/mL, FSH concentrations up to 1000 mIU/mL, and TSH concentrations up to 1000 μIU/mL.
Interference:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate potential interference from certain exogenous
compounds, each interferent was made at 100X concentrate bulk and spiked in both hCG
negative (5 mIU/mL for serum, 10 mIU/mL for urine) and hCG positive (10 mIU/mL for
serum, 20 mIU/mL for urine) samples. Each spiked urine sample was mixed for 5 minutes to
ensure a homogeneous solution before testing. Each sample was tested using 3 device lots of
the testing kit. Results are shown in the following table.
The results showed that no interferences were observed from substances at the following
concentrations for both negative and positive hCG urine and serum samples.

Effect of hCG beta-core fragment:
To evaluate potential interference by hCG β-core fragment, negative and positive samples (5
and 10 mIU/mL hCG in serum; 10 and 20 mIU/mL hCG in urine) were spiked with various
concentrations of hCG β -core fragment (0 to 2x106 pmol/L). These samples were tested by 3
operators using 3 different lots. No false negative results were identified for the sample with
2.0 x 106 pmol/L of hCG β -core fragment. The results indicate that high levels of hCG β -
core fragment (≥ 100 pmol /L) can lead to a false positive results for hCG-free samples (in
both serum and urine formats).

Effect of urine pH:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in urine pH, negative and positive urine
samples containing 10 and 20 mIU/mL hCG were tested with 3 lots of device by 3 operators
using samples at pH 4 to 9. Data show that there is no interference from pH ranging from 4 to
9 of tested urine samples.
Effect of urine specific gravity:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, negative and positive
urine samples containing 10 and 20 mIU/mL hCG were tested with 3 lots of device by 3
operators using samples at density values ranging from 1.001 to1.035. Data show that there is
no interference from density values ranging from 1.001 to1.035 of tested urine samples.
Hook effect study:
To evaluate high dose hook effect, negative urine and serum samples were spiked with hCG
concentrations ranging from 500 to 2,000,000 mIU/mL. The spiked samples were tested by 3
different operators using 3 device lots. The results showed no hook effect up to 2,000,000
mIU/mL.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative test.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed, comparing the results obtained from the
Alltest hCG Pregnancy Rapid Combo Test Cassette to the results from predicate
devices (k132834). A total of 105 urine and 107 serum samples were collected from 212 women,
between the ages of 20 to 49, from three POC testing sites (about half of them were less than 5
weeks pregnant). Samples were randomly collected at various times throughout the day. All
samples were randomly masked prior to analysis. Samples were tested by two different health
professionals, at each site, with the candidate device (using three different lots) and the predicate
device. The results are shown in the tables below.
