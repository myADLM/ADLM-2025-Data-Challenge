IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA Test Kit is an
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the qualitative detection of IgG and IgM
antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum.
During the test procedure, antibodies to B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) if present in the human
serum sample will bind to the antigens coated onto the wells forming antigen-antibody
complexes. Excess antibodies are removed by washing. A conjugate of goat anti-human
IgG/IgM antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase is then added, which binds to the
antigen-antibody complexes. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. This is followed by
the addition of a chromogenic substrate, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). If specific antibodies
to the antigen are present in the patients’ serum, a blue color will develop. The enzymatic
reaction is then stopped with a stopping solution causing the contents of the well to turn yellow.
The wells are read photometrically with a microplate reader at 450nm. OD values from controls
or patient samples are converted to units by comparing to a cutoff value established using
calibrators included with the kit. A result <9.0 units is negative and a result >11.0 units is
positive. Samples with results of 9.0-11.0 units are considered equivocal.
The antigens used in the assay is a combination of recombinant VlsE and OspC from B.
burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31. The recombinants are produced in E. coli and purified by
immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) via Polyhistidine-tag. The purity of each
antigen is assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by Colloidal-Coomassie staining and western
blotting.
The kit includes 12 x 8 well Antigen Coated strips, Conjugate, Substrate, Stop Solution, Wash
Buffer, Diluent, Negative Control, Positive Control, and a Calibrator. The controls are
provided to determine if the assay is functioning properly and to determine the antibody level.
The reagents are sufficient for 96 determinations.
Calculation of Units and Results Interpretation
K203289 - Page 4 of 23

--- Page 5 ---
The OD of the blank value should be subtracted from all other OD values. The cutoff is
determined by multiplying the Calibrator OD (or mean OD) by the Correction Factor value
printed on the Calibrator vial label and on the Quality Control Certificate.
Cutoff = OD Calibrator x Correction Factor (C.F.)
Units* = (OD Controls or Samples / Cutoff) x 10
*Units are qualitative. They are values defined by the manufacturer.
The results are interpreted as follows:
Units Results Interpretation
<9.0 Negative No detectable antibody. Result does not exclude B.
burgdorferi infection
9.0-11.0 Equivocal Initial evidence of antibodies to B. burgdorferi
>11.0 Positive Antibodies to B. burgdorferi presumptively detected

Sample Stability Study
Fresh samples (a Positive, Low Positive, High Negative and Negative sample) were initially
tested on the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA
Test (day 0) then subsequently stored at 2 to 8°C for eight days. No significant changes in
assay signal was observed. The data support a stability claim of seven days when stored at 2
to 8°C.

Freeze-thaw Study
A similar study was performed on samples stored frozen (including a positive, low positive,
high negative, and negative sample). Samples were tested initially at day 0 and subsequently
frozen at -20°C. The samples were then thawed, tested and frozen. This process was repeated
for a total of four freeze-thaw cycles. No significant changes were observed over the course
of the study supporting a freeze-thaw stability claim of three freeze-thaw cycles.
6. Detection Limit:
Not Applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The cutoff was determined by testing a total of 238 normal sera which consisted of 101 sera
from an endemic region of Lyme disease and 95 sera from a non-endemic region of Lyme
disease. The mean plus three standard deviations was used to determine the assay cutoff. A
known positive sample was then diluted to produce a ready to use cutoff control. An
additional 197 samples consisting of 125 samples from different phases of Lyme disease (79
samples from Dr. Steere and 46 samples from the CDC), and 72 negative Lyme disease
samples (from CDC) but do have other diseases that may cause serologic cross-reactivity,
were tested. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate
the performance of the assay and confirm that the chosen cutoff provided the best
compromise between sensitivity and specificity.
