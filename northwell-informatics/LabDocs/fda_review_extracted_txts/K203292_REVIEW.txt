IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test Kit is an Enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the qualitative detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to
Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum.
During the test procedure, antibodies to B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) if present in the human
serum sample will bind to the antigens coated onto the wells forming antigen-antibody
complexes. Excess antibodies are removed by washing. A conjugate of goat anti-human
IgG/IgM antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase is then added, which binds to the
antigen-antibody complexes. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. This is followed by
the addition of a chromogenic substrate, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). If specific antibodies
to the antigen are present in the patients’ serum, a blue color will develop. The enzymatic
reaction is then stopped with a stopping solution causing the contents of the well to turn yellow.
The wells are read photometrically with a microplate reader at 450nm.
The antigens used in the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test
kit is a combination of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31 lysate, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto
strain 2591 lysate, and a recombinant VlsE from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31. The
lysates use spirochetes growing in BSK-H complete medium until mid-exponential phase. The
recombinant VlsE protein is produced in E. coli SURE2 cells and purified by affinity
chromatography. The purity of each antigen is assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie
staining and/or western blotting.
The kit includes 12 x 8 well Antigen Coated strips, Conjugate, Substrate, Stop Solution, Wash
Buffer, Diluent, Negative Control, Positive Control, and a Cutoff Control. The controls are
provided to determine if the assay is functioning properly and to determine the antibody level.
The reagents are sufficient for 96 determinations.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The cut-off was determined by testing a total of 200 normal sera which consisted of 100 sera
from an endemic region of Lyme disease and 100 sera from a non-endemic region. The mean
plus two standard deviations was used to determine the assay cut-off. After the cut-off was
determined 125 characterized Lyme disease samples were tested. An ROC analysis was then
generated with the 325 samples (200 normal and 125 characterized samples) to verify the
chosen cut-off. The analysis confirmed that the assay cut-off provided an optimal level of
sensitivity and specificity.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Gold Standard Diagnostics MTTT-IgG/IgM ELISA Method Comparison: The Gold
Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test was utilized in a MTTT (2-
ELISA) protocol with the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC
IgG/IgM ELISA Test. The MTTT (2-ELISA) results were compared to the standard two-tier
testing (STTT) using the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA
followed by testing all positive and equivocal results on the predicate Gold Standard
Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG blot test and Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia
burgdorferi IgM blot test.
Comparison studies were conducted at three sites (one internal and two external reference
laboratories) using prospective samples submitted for Lyme serology testing. Four hundred
eighty-one (481) serum samples were tested on the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia
burgdorferi IgG/IgM ELISA Test. A total of 54 positive and equivocal samples were
obtained.
In the STTT protocol the samples that were positive or equivocal (n=54) were tested with B.
burgdorferi IgG and IgM blot tests. In the MTTT protocol the samples (n=54) were tested on
a second ELISA, the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM
ELISA Test. In the second-tier ELISA test, positive and equivocal results were considered
positive. A summary of the two test methodologies is provided in the figures below.
