IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test Kit is an Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the qualitative detection of IgM antibodies to Borrelia
burgdorferi in human serum.
During the test procedure, antibodies to B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) if present in the human
serum sample will bind to the antigens coated onto the wells forming antigen-antibody
complexes. Excess antibodies are removed by washing. A conjugate of goat anti-human
IgM antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase is then added, which binds to the
antigen-antibody complexes. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. This is followed by
the addition of a chromogenic substrate, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). If specific antibodies
to the antigen are present in the patients’ serum, a blue color will develop. The enzymatic
reaction is then stopped with a stopping solution causing the contents of the well to turn yellow.
The wells are read photometrically with a microplate reader at 450nm.
The antigens used in the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test kit is
a combination of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31 lysate, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain
2591 lysate, and a recombinant VlsE from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31. The lysates
use spirochetes growing in BSK-H complete medium until mid-exponential phase. The
recombinant VlsE protein is produced in E. coli SURE2 cells and purified by affinity
chromatography. The purity of each antigen is assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie
staining and/or western blotting.
The kit includes 12 x 8 well Antigen Coated strips, Conjugate, Substrate, Stop Solution, Wash
Buffer, Diluent, Negative Control, Positive Control, and a Cutoff Control. The controls are
provided to determine if the assay is functioning properly and to determine the antibody level.
The reagents are sufficient for 96 determinations.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Note: This clearance is for a modified use for a previously cleared IVD, the Gold Standard
Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test Kit (K200023). Representative analytical
study data are presented below.
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
To determine the precision of the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM
ELISA Test, a within-lab precision study was conducted. A precision panel consisting of a
negative sample, a high negative sample, a low positive sample, and a moderate positive
sample, along with the kit controls, was tested in-house. The sample panel was masked and
randomized. Each of the panel members was tested in duplicate, twice per day, for 12 days.
The results are summarized in the following table.

The cutoff was determined by testing a total of 208 normal sera which consisted of 103 sera
from an endemic region of Lyme disease and 105 sera from a non-endemic region of Lyme
disease. The mean plus two standard deviations was used to determine the assay cutoff. A
known positive sample was then diluted to produce a ready to use cutoff control. An
additional 194 samples consisting of 114 samples from different phases of Lyme disease, 8
negative healthy samples, 72 negative Lyme disease samples but do have other diseases that
may cause serologic cross-reactivity, were tested. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of the assay and confirm that the chosen
cutoff provided the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Gold Standard Diagnostics MTTT-IgM ELISA Method Comparison: The Gold Standard
Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test was utilized in a MTTT (2-ELISA)
protocol with the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM
ELISA Test. The MTTT (2-ELISA) results were compared to the standard two-tier testing
(STTT) using the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgM ELISA followed by
testing all positive and equivocal results on the predicate IgM blot test.
Comparison studies were conducted at three sites (one internal and two external reference
laboratories) using prospective samples submitted for Lyme serology testing. Four hundred
eighty-one (481) serum samples were tested on the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia
burgdorferi IgM ELISA Test. A total of 68 positive and equivocal samples were obtained.
In the STTT protocol the samples that were positive or equivocal (n=68) were tested with the
predicate B. burgdorferi IgM blot test. In the MTTT protocol the samples (n=68) were tested
on a second ELISA, the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC
IgG/IgM ELISA Test. In the second-tier ELISA test, positive and equivocal results were
considered positive. These testing strategies are summarized in the two figures below.
