III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG ELISA Test Kit
The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG ELISA Test Kit is intended as a
qualitative test for the detection of IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in human serum
from symptomatic patients or people suspected of infection. When used as the first-tier screening
test, positive and equivocal results must be supplemented through additional testing by one of the
following methods:
a) Standard two-tier test methodology (STTT) using an IgG blot test following current
interpretation guidelines, OR
b) Modified two-tier test methodology (MTTT) using the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia
burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM ELISA Test.
The assay can also be used as a second-tier confirmation test using the MTTT methodology
when used with the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC IgG/IgM
ELISA Test as the first-tier screening test.
Positive test results by either the STTT or MTTT methodology are supportive evidence for the
presence of antibodies and exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease. A
diagnosis of Lyme disease should be made based on the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi
antibodies, history, symptoms, and other laboratory findings.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The kit includes 12 x 8 well Antigen Coated strips, Conjugate, Substrate, Stop Solution, Wash
Buffer, Diluent, Negative Control, Positive Control, and Cutoff Control. The controls are
provided to determine if the assay is functioning properly and to determine the antibody level.
The reagents are sufficient for 96 determinations.
During the test procedure, antibodies to B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) if present in the human
serum sample will bind to the antigens coated onto the wells forming antigen-antibody
complexes. Excess antibodies are removed by washing. A conjugate of goat anti-human IgG
antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase is then added, which binds to the antigen-
antibody complexes. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. This is followed by the addition
of a chromogenic substrate, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). If specific antibodies to the antigen are
present in the patients’ serum, a blue color will develop. The enzymatic reaction is then stopped
with a stopping solution causing the contents of the well to turn yellow. The wells are read
photometrically with a microplate reader at 450 nm.
The antigens used in the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG ELISA Test kit is a
combination of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31 lysate, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain 2591
lysate, and a recombinant VlsE from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31. The lysates use
spirochetes growing in BSK-H complete medium until mid-exponential phase. The recombinant
VlsE protein is produced in E. coli SURE2 cells and purified by affinity chromatography. The purity
of each antigen is assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining and/or Western blotting.

Note: This clearance is for a modified use for a previously cleared IVD, the Gold Standard
Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG ELISA Test Kit (K200025). Representative analytical
study data are presented below.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
To determine the precision of the Borrelia burgdorferi IgG ELISA Test, a within-lab
precision study was conducted. A precision panel consisting of a negative sample, a high
negative sample, a low positive sample, and a moderate positive sample, along with the kit
controls, was tested in-house. The sample panel was masked and randomized. Each of the
panel members was tested in duplicate, twice per day, for 12 days. The results are
summarized in the following table:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG ELISA Test was utilized in a
MTTT (2-ELISA) protocol with the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-
OspC IgG/IgM ELISA Test.
The MTTT (2-ELISA) results were compared to the standard two-tier testing (STTT) using
the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG ELISA followed by testing all
positive and equivocal results on the predicate Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia
burgdorferi IgG blot test.
Comparison studies were conducted at three sites (one internal and two external reference
laboratories) using prospective samples submitted for Lyme serology testing. Four hundred
eighty-one (481) serum samples were tested on the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia
burgdorferi IgG ELISA Test. A total of 38 positive and equivocal samples were obtained.
In the STTT protocol the samples that were positive or equivocal (n=38) were tested with the
predicate B. burgdorferi IgG blot test. In the MTTT protocol the samples (n=38) were tested
on a second ELISA, the Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi VlsE-OspC
IgG/IgM ELISA Test. In the second-tier ELISA test, positive and equivocal results were
considered positive. These testing strategies are summarized in the two figures below.

also assessed by comparing results to second-tier western blot testing on only those samples
positive by the first-tier Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi IgG ELISA.

The above performance table artificially inflates the negative percent agreement of the
second-tier test since a large number of negatives are negative by the first tier test.
