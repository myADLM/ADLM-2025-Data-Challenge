B Indication(s) for Use:
The Barco MDPC-8127 device is intended for in vitro diagnostic use to display digital images of
histopathology slides acquired from IVD-labeled whole-slide imaging scanners and viewed using
IVD-labeled digital pathology image viewing software that have been validated for use with this
device. It is an aid to the pathologist to review and interpret digital images of histopathology
slides for primary diagnosis. It is the responsibility of the pathologist to employ appropriate
procedures and safeguards to assure the validity of the interpretation of images using the MDPC-
8127. The display is not intended for use with digital images from frozen section, cytology, or
non-formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (non-FFPE) hematopathology specimens.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Barco MDPC-8127 is a medical, color-calibrated display, specifically intended for review
and interpretation of digital images of surgical pathology slides from IVD-labeled whole-slide
imaging scanners and digital pathology image viewing software. The MDPC-8127 consists of a
high-resolution 27-inch color LCD-panel and can be calibrated to the sRGB color gamut or other
broader color spaces. The display uses built-in techniques to ensure constant accuracy over time.
The display characteristics and specifications are provided in the Table below.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling, which includes FFPE tissues, is performed by clinicians. Biopsy
specimens are processed and FFPE slides are scanned by trained healthcare professionals to
generate a digital image.
4. Calibration:
Calibrated color spaces: DICOM GSDF and sRGB
5. Quality Control:
Image quality is checked by the user for acceptability. In addition, quality checks for the
display are initiated by the QAWeb quality assurance software and performed as a
background activity.
