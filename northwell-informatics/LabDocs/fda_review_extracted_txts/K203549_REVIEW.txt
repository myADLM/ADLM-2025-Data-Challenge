III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
Please see indication(s) for use.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Nova Primary Glucose Analyzer System is indicated for in vitro diagnostic use by
healthcare professionals in clinical laboratory settings for the quantitative determination of
Glucose in lithium heparinized venous whole blood and plasma.
The measurement of Glucose is used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism
disturbances including diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, and idiopathic hypoglycemia,
and pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Not for point-of-care use.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Nova Primary Glucose Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Nova Primary Glucose Analyzer System is a benchtop laboratory glucose analyzer that
measures blood glucose levels in lithium heparinized venous whole blood or plasma and utilizes
a glucose-oxidase-based sensor and membrane/cap assembly. The system is comprised of the
following: the analyzer, a wireless keyboard, a glucose sensor, a glucose sensor membrane cap, a
calibrator pack, thermal paper for an onboard printer, and an optional barcode scanner.
The Nova Primary Glucose Analyzer utilizes an integrated calibrator pack with an RFID data
management tag to monitor pack expiration date and number of samples remaining. All
calibrator lot information is programmed into the RFID tags.
B Principle of Operation:
Glucose measurement is based on the level of H O produced during the enzymatic reaction
2 2
between glucose and oxygen molecules in the presence of the glucose oxidase enzyme. At a
constant potential of 0.70 volts, electroactive H O is oxidized at the surface of the platinum
2 2
anode. The current generated by the flow of electrons at the surface of the platinum electrode is
proportional to the glucose concentration of the sample.

C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Nova Primary Glucose Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
When running a sample, an operator enters a sample ID of up to 40 alpha-numeric characters
using either (or a combination of) the keyboard or the optional wireless scanner, if desired.
Previously analyzed sample and quality control results are retained indefinitely in the
analyzer’s database and can be recalled for review, printed, and exported to a USB device as
a .csv file for use in an offline spreadsheet.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The device is intended to be used with lithium heparin venous whole blood and plasma
samples from syringes using a port on a venous line, blood collection tubes, or small cups.
Once an analysis sequence has been initiated by the user, the device extends the sample
probe to aspirate a volume of sample (minimum sample volume for analysis is 25 µL) from
one of the appropriate containers listed above into the analyzer’s flow path. The sample
probe then retracts into the device and the analysis starts. Once the sample measurement is
complete, the device aspirates calibrator pack reagents through the sample probe to
flush/wash the sample probe between sample analyses. The device then conducts a 1-point
sensor calibration prior to each sample analysis to ensure no carry over between samples.
If using blood collection tubes, samples should be collected with minimal stasis, without the
exercise of the arm. Samples should be well mixed before introduction into the analyzer and
should be analyzed within 15 minutes of collection for glucose to minimize the clinical
impact of glycolysis on the measured glucose result. Measurement delays greater than 15
minutes may impact the clinical accuracy of the glucose measurement. Plasma samples
should be separated from contact with cells as soon as possible to a maximum time limit of 2
hours from the time of collection.
4. Calibration:
Automatic two-point calibration every 2 hours, automatic one-point calibration with samples.
5. Quality Control:
Two levels of quality control material can be monitored on the Nova Primary Glucose
Analyzer System. Results that exceed the entered ranges are flagged for identification.
Laboratories should perform the following minimum QC procedures (External Ampule QC)
on each analyzer: (1) During every 24 hours of testing one normal and one abnormal level of
control, (2) After performing system maintenance, follow good laboratory practice guideline
for performing quality control analysis.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the Nova Primary Glucose Analyzer was evaluated using three (3) Nova Primary
Glucose Analyzers and two (3) YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose and L-Lactate Analyzers
(K891480). Two (2) lots of Nova Primary Calibrator Cartridges, and two (2) lots of glucose
membranes were used over the course of the study.
Venous Whole Blood
Low and high pools were prepared from the pooled whole blood with glucose concentrations
outside of the analytical measurement range. Samples of 10 different concentrations spanning
beyond the claimed analytical range were made from the low and high pools using serial
dilutions. Each blood level was analyzed in triplicate in random order on three (3) Nova
Primary test analyzers and on the YSI 2300 analyzers. The results from each test analyzer
were compared to the average of the test results from the YSI 2300 analyzers.
Plasma
Previously prepared whole blood samples were spun down to plasma. Each plasma level was
analyzed in triplicate in random order on three (3) Nova Primary test analyzers and on the
YSI 2300 analyzers. The results from each test analyzer were compared to the average of the
test results from the YSI 2300 analyzers.
The results of the least squares linear regression analyses are shown below:

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
An interference study was performed using venous whole blood and plasma samples. The
possible interfering substances were tested at two glucose concentrations (~ 80-100 mg/dL
and ~ 200 mg/dL) and compared to a control sample.
The test substance was considered an interfering substance if the difference between the
mean test value and the mean control value exceeded ±10%. If the difference between the
test and control means was greater than the allowed bias, a dose response was performed.
The sponsor determined the following substances did not cause interference at the
concentrations listed below:

The Glucose Calibrators, Controls, and Standards are traceable to the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard SRM-917.
6. Detection Limit:
Detection capability studies of limit of blank, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation for
glucose on the Nova Primary Glucose Analyzer System were conducted following the
recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2. These studies supported the claim of 20 mg/dL as the

was compared to the average of the test results from the comparative method.
