III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.
The Immunalysis SEFRIA Oxycodone Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous
enzyme immunoassay with a cutoff of 30 ng/mL in neat oral fluid collected by Quantisal or
Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device. The assay is intended for the qualitative and semi-
quantitative analysis of oxycodone in human oral fluid with clinical analyzers. This assay is
calibrated against oxycodone.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate
dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass
Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The Immunalysis SEFRIA Oxycodone Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in
order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
or Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any
test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The SEFRIATM Oxycodone Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay was validated using the Beckman
Coulter AU480 chemistry analyzer. Confirmatory tests were run in the Agilent 6430 Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The SEFRIA Oxycodone Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay consists of ready to use reagents for
use on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. The SEFRIA Oxycodone Oral Fluid Enzyme
Immunoassay is provided in two kit sizes by volume: 100 mL (621OF-0100K) and 500 mL
(621OF-0500K). Each kit box contains the following reagents:
• 1 X Enzyme Acceptor/Antibody Reagent (EA) - This contains EA protein and recombinant
antibodies to oxycodone, in PIPES buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.
K203564 - Page 2 of 18

--- Page 3 ---
• 1 X Enzyme Donor/Substrate Reagent (ED) - This contains ED peptide labeled with
oxycodone and CPRG substrate in malic acid buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
The SEFRIA technology is based on artificial fragments of the E. coli enzyme β-galactosidase. A
mutant enzyme, termed Enzyme Acceptor (EA), is created by deletion of a short sequence in the
amino-terminal region of the sequence. EA is inactive, but can combine with peptides, termed
Enzyme Donors (ED’s), containing the deleted sequence, to form active β-galactosidase. This
process is termed complementation, and the active enzyme formed as a result can be measured
by hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate such as chlorophenol red β-D-galactopyranoside
(CPRG). The ED peptides can be modified by attachment of a derivative of oxycodone, which
does not interfere with the formation of active β-galactosidase. However, antibodies to
oxycodone bind to the ED-oxycodone conjugate, and block complementation. The assay is based
on the competition of oxycodone in an oral fluid sample with the ED-oxycodone conjugate for
the fixed amount of antibody binding sites. In the absence of the free drug in the sample, the
antibody binds the ED-oxycodone conjugate, resulting in inhibition of enzyme formation. As the
oxycodone concentration in the sample increases, ED-oxycodone becomes available for
complementation, creating a dose response relationship between oxycodone concentration
in the oral fluid and enzyme formation. The β-galactosidase activity is determined
spectrophotometrically at 570 nm by the conversion of CPRG (orange) to chlorophenol red (red)
and galactose.

An additional 20-day study was performed on 3 lots of assay reagent to demonstrate the
repeatability across multiple reagent lots. All sample concentrations ranging from -100% to -
25% of the cutoff were negative and all sample concentrations ranging from +25% to +100% of
cutoff were positive for both qualitative and semi-quantitative interpretations.
2. Linearity:
Assay linearity was evaluated in the semi-quantitative mode by spiking a drug free oral fluid
pool with a high concentration of oxycodone. Additional pools were made by serially
diluting the high concentration specimen with drug free oral fluid to achieve concentrations
ranging from 10 ng/mL to 110 ng/mL. The 0 ng/mL specimen was made from drug free oral
fluid. Each pool was collected by Quantisal and Quantisal II oral fluid collection devices and
tested in triplicate to calculate the mean concentration values that were used to calculate drug
recovery. The results in semi-quantitative mode are presented in the following tables.

The study demonstrated that the SEFRIATM Oxycodone Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay
has good correlation to the expected concentration in the range from10 to 100 ng/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Structurally and functionally similar compounds were spiked into drug free pooled oral fluid
at levels that will yield a result that is equivalent to the cutoff, if cross reacting. The study
assessed the cross reactivity of the oxycodone assay to related drugs and drug metabolites, in
both the qualitative and semiquantitative modes. Cross-reactivity test results in qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes are presented in the tables below.

Interference – Endogenous Compounds and Exogenous Compounds
Endogenous compounds and exogenous compounds were evaluated in qualitative and semi-
quantitative modes by spiking the potential interferent into drug free oral fluid containing
oxycodone at ±25% of the cutoff. Additional orally used products were tested by collecting
oral fluid using Quantisal and Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Devices from subjects after
use of the substances. At the levels tested, there was no interference observed with endogenous
compounds, exogenous compounds and orally used compounds. Endogenous compounds and
exogenous compounds are presented in the first and second tables below. Orally used
compounds are presented in the 3rd table below.

Interference – pH
To evaluate potential interference from the effect of oral fluid pH, device performance in the
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of oral fluid pH values (3.0,
4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0). All test samples were prepared in drug free oral fluid
containing oxycodone at ±25% of the cutoff. At the pH levels tested, there was no interference
observed for each test mode.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay reportable range for the semi-quantitative mode is 10 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The assay is traceable to a commercially available, certified, standard material with the
concentration verified by GC-MS or LC-MS/MS.
Oxycodone Stability in Oral Fluid
Drug free negative oral fluid spiked with oxycodone at +50% of the 30 ng/mL cutoff were
collected and stored in Quantisal and Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Devices at 2°C -
8°C, tested by LC-MS/MS at each time point and compared to the baseline concentration
result. The test results indicate that oral fluid samples containing oxycodone are stable for up
to 12 months stored in Quantisal or Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device at 2°C - 8°C.
Data to support 10-day storage in Quantisal or Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection
Device at ambient temperature 8°C - 25°C were reported in K183048 and K200801.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay cut-off cutoff for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of oxycodone in
neat oral fluid is 30 ng/mL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Eighty (80) deidentified, unaltered clinical oral fluid samples collected using the Quantisal
and Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Devices were obtained from clinical research
facilities, analyzed for oxycodone at assay cutoff with the SEFRIATM Oxycodone Oral
Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes and compared
to Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) results (using the
Agilent 6430 Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry). Method comparison
