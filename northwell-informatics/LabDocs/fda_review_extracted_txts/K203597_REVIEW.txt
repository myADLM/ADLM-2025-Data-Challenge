III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Cholesterol2 assay is used for the quantitation of cholesterol in human serum or plasma on
the ARCHITECT c System . The Cholesterol2 assay is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis and
treatment of disorders involving excess cholesterol in the blood and lipid and lipoprotein
metabolism disorders.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use on ARCHITECT c8000 System.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Cholesterol2 reagent kits are available in two formats that allow for testing 1000 or 3200
samples. Each kit is comprised of one reagent:
Reagent 1: Active ingredients: cholesterol esterase 0.880 KU/L, cholesterol oxidase
(CONII-FD) 0.330 KU/L, TODB 0.466 g/L, 4-aminoantipyrine
0.134 g/L and peroxidase (POD) 6.600 KU/L.
Preservative: Sodium azide.
The following are also required to conduct testing but are not provided with the kit:
• Cholesterol2 assay file found on www.corelaboratory.abbott
• 04V1501 Consolidated Chemistry Calibrator
• Controls containing cholesterol
• Saline (0.85% to 0.90% NaCl) for specimen dilution
B Principle of Operation:
Cholesterol esters are enzymatically hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase to cholesterol and free
fatty acids. Free cholesterol, including that originally present, is then oxidized by cholesterol
oxidase to cholest-4-ene-3-one and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide oxidatively
couples with N,N-Bis(4-sulfobutyl)-3-methylaniline (TODB) and 4-aminoantipyrine to form a
chromophore (quinoneimine dye) which is quantitated at 604 nm.

2. Linearity:
A total of 15 samples were prepared for the linearity assessment with concentrations
spanning the claimed measuring range, 5 to 748 mg/dL. Each level was analyzed in replicates
of two using 1 lot of reagent, 1 lot of calibrator, 1 lot of control, and 1 instrument.
Deviations from linearity within the claimed range were never observed to be greater than
5%.
The sponsor provided dilution studies which supported the measurement of samples above
the measurement range diluted by a factor of 4.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference testing was performed based on guidance from CLSI EP07, 3rd ed. using 2
different concentrations of cholesterol (150 mg/dL and 220 mg/dL) with individual
interferents at a range of concentrations. Samples were tested in replicates of 10 using one lot
of reagent and one ARCHITECT c8000 analyzer. The following tables list the concentration
of each substance at which no significant interference was detected; defined as a difference
of less than or equal to ±10% between the test sample and control.

To address potential interference from conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, the labeling
contains the following statements:
• Specimens with conjugated bilirubin levels greater than 7 mg/dL or unconjugated
bilirubin greater than 11 mg/dL may cause falsely depressed results with the Cholesterol2
assay. Refer to the SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, Analytical
Specificity, Interference section of this package insert. To estimate sample icterus levels,
refer to the Sample Interference Indices instructions for use to assess hemolysis (H),
icterus (I) and lipemia (L) (HIL) indices.

Limit of Blank:
The LoB was determined by testing 6 zero-analyte samples in replicates of 10 using 3 lots of
reagent on 2 instruments across 3 days for a total 60 measurements. Using the parametric
approach, LoB was derived from the 95th percentile of a normal distribution.
Limit of Detection:
The LoD was determined by testing 6 low-analyte level samples. Each sample was tested in
replicates of 10 using 3 lots of reagent on 2 instruments across 3 days for a total 60
measurements. The parametric approach described in CLSI EP17-A2 was followed to
determine the LoD.
Limit of Quantitation:
The LoQ was determined by testing two samples with low concentrations tested in replicates
of 10 using 3 lots of reagent on 2 instruments across 3 days for a total of 60 measurements .
The sponsor defined the LoQ as the lowest analyte concentration where the %CV was ≤
20%.
The detection limit results are summarized as follows:

An additional method comparison study was conducted to support accuracy at concentrations
ranging from 700 to 748 mg/dL. Results from the candidate cholesterol assay on the
ARCHITECT c800 were compared to the results obtained from a certified reference method.
The high concentration samples demonstrated ≤ 2.4% bias from the reference method.

The matrix comparison study was performed using 60 samples of each sample type across
the measurable range. The samples were analyzed on the ARCHITECT c8000 analyzer.
Individual results of each matrix comparison study were compared to the reference results
