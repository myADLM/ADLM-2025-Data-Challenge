Capture-CMV® is an in vitro qualitative solid phase red cell adherence test system for the
detection of antibodies (IgG plus IgM) to cytomegalovirus (CMV) in human serum or plasma.
Capture-CMV® is intended to be used in screening of patients for serological evidence of
previous infection by CMV using manual and semi-automated methods, NEO Iris® and Galileo
NEO®.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The CMV assay is to be used with manual, semi-automated methods as well as with NEO Iris®
and Galileo NEO® instruments.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Capture-CMV is a solid phase red cell adherence antibody detection system based on procedures
of Plapp et al (1984;82:719).
The assay consists of Capture-CMV Microtitration Wells coated with glycine-extracted and
purified CMV antigen obtained from cytomegalovirus strain AD 169 grown in human foreskin
(HF) fibroblast cells.
Sold separately are the adjunct reagents to capture test wells and controls.
- Capture-CMV Indicator Red Cells: a suspension of human red blood cells coated with
rabbit anti-human IgG plus goat anti-human IgM molecules;
- Capture LISS: a low ionic strength solution containing glycine, bromocresol purple dye
and sodium azide
- Capture-CMV Positive Control Serum (weak): Human serum containing IgG antibodies
to CMV viral proteins
- Capture-CMV Negative Control Serum: Human serum containing no antibodies to CMV
The CMV assay is to be used with manual, semi-automated methods as well as with NEO Iris®
and Galileo NEO® instruments.
B Principle of Operation:
This procedure is a modification of the mixed agglutination tests for antigen and antibody
detection of Coombs et al. (1956;2:84) and Hogman (1959;4:12).
The assay procedure is a two-step solid phase red cell adherence test carried out in microtitration
wells coated with inactivated CMV virus. The CMV antigen utilized in this test is obtained from
the cytomegalovirus strain AD 169 grown in human foreskin (HF) fibroblast cells. The
inactivated virus is coated onto microtitration wells. The wells are dried and supplied to users
along with necessary reagents and controls. Serum or plasma samples are added to the viral-
coated wells and incubated for five minutes during which antibodies specific for CMV proteins
bind to immobilized viral proteins. Unbound immunoglobulins are washed from the wells and
replaced with a suspension of anti-IgG and anti-IgM-coated indicator red cells. Centrifugation
brings the indicator red cells in contact with antibodies bound to the immobilized viral proteins.
In the case of a positive test, the migration of the indicator cells to the bottom of the well is
impeded as the anti-IgG and anti-IgM bridges are formed between the indicator red cells and the
viralbound antibodies. As a consequence, the indicator red cells adhere over the surface of the
K203612 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
test well. In contrast, in the absence of viral antigen-antibody interactions (i.e. a negative test)
the indicator red cells are not impeded during their migration, and pellet to the bottom of the well
as a packed, well-defined cell button.
The image of cells adhered in the well is captured and analyzed by an instrument. The plate
reader uses IDS CMOS camera to capture an image of the microplate from underneath. The
software calculates a reaction value for each well based on a multi feature image analysis then
assigns a result and interpretation to the wells based on predefined criteria associated with the
calculated reaction value.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
The NEO Iris® and Galileo NEO® instruments
2. Specimen Identification:
The Gaileo NEO supports the use of the following barcode symbologies: Codabar; Code 128;
ISBT 128 (Concatenated barcodes are not supported) and Code 39.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A blood specimen is drawn using an acceptable phlebotomy technique. Serum or plasma
(EDTA, CPD, CP2D, CPDA-1, ACD) may be used in this assay. Testing should be
performed as soon as possible to minimize the chance that falsely positive or falsely negative
reactions will occur due to improper storage or contamination of the specimen. Should
delays in testing occur, serum or EDTA, CPD, and ACD anticoagulated whole blood
specimens should be stored at 1-10°C for up to one week. Specimens collected in CP2D and
CPDA-1 anticoagulants and stored as whole blood specimens at 1-10°C may be tested up to
42 days post-collection. Testing of CPDA-1 and ACD anticoagulated specimens stored at
18-25°C for five days is acceptable. Alternatively, serum or plasma can be separated from
red cells and stored frozen at –20°C in a nondefrosting freezer refrigerator. Samples should
not be repeatedly frozen and thawed.
The Galileo NEO is programmed to move microplates, liquid reagent fluids, and blood
sample fluids to different bays and processing areas for a given assay in the correct sequence.
Such bays and areas include incubator bays, the microplate washing station, the centrifuge,
and the reader.
4. Calibration:
The instrument is calibrated at the site of manufacture using a reader verification plate
(RVP). The plate is provided with the instrument to the end user, for calibration verification.
Reader verification plate is stored in a protective case and should be replaced upon expiration
that is three years from the calibration date which is the same as the release date provided on
the Release Statement.
5. Quality Control:
Capture-CMV Positive Control Serum
Capture-CMV Negative Control Serum
The reactivity of the Capture-CMV® assay is evaluated at each run by inclusion of the
negative and weak positive controls. If, in any test run, the Positive Control Serum (Weak)
does not produce positive results and/or the Negative Control Serum does not produce
negative results, the NEO Iris®/Galileo NEO® will invalidate the test run and all the tests
K203612 - Page 3 of 10

--- Page 4 ---
performed in the run must be repeated. Continued failure of the control sera to perform
properly may indicate that either one or more of the test reagents has deteriorated.

VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:
Not applicable
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The Galileo NEO® instrument is identical to the NEO Iris® instrument, except branding and
exterior colors. Thus, the CMV assay performance on Galileo NEO® is identical to the
CMV assay performance on NEO Iris®. Consequently, the reproducibility data collected for
the CMV assay on the NEO Iris® (K183571) were re-used in the current application and are
summarized below.
Reproducibility of Capture-CMV® assay on NEO Iris® was determined at three test sites:
two external sites and one internally at Immucor. A panel of ten coded samples was used:
five CMV antibody positive and five CMV antibody negative. The samples were tested by
two operators, in duplicate, two runs per day for five nonconsecutive days. A variance
component analysis was performed based on the original raw scores. Reproducibility was
assessed as concordance between the CMV assay result and the status of the sample. The
summary of reproducibility results by site are presented in Table 2 below.

Assay limitations:
- Positive test results in symptomatic patients require careful interpretation since false-
positive reactions or heterotypic IgM responses may occur with sera from patients with
heterophile-positive mononucleosis or varicella zoster infection (see also the Product
Insert)
- Care should be taken in interpreting test results of neonatal samples. A positive test
usually indicates the presence of antibodies passively transferred from mother to fetus. A
negative test may be helpful in excluding possible infection, but a diagnosis of active
CMV infection may require viral culture.

9. Carry-Over:
There were no changes to Capture-CMV® assay reagents and controls since it has been
cleared under K183571
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
No new clinical studies were performed as the NEO Iris® and the upgraded Galileo NEO®
(software version 3.0.1) instruments are functionally identical. The data in the following
tables were submitted for clearance of the NEO Iris® in K183571 and are included in the
current submission to support clearance of the Capture-CMV® assay when used with the
upgraded Galileo NEO® (software version 3.0.1). In these studies, the performance of the
Capture-CMV® on NEO Iris® was compared with the performance of the assay on the
original Galileo NEO® instrument (cleared in BK100033). For more information refer to
K183571: Capture-CMV® (K183571 Decision Summary and 510(k) Summary).
The following section provides a summary of the previous study and results. Method
comparison studies were performed at four clinical sites, three external sites and internally at
Immucor, Inc. for donor specimens and at two external sites and internally at Immucor, Inc.
for patient specimens. Specimens were tested on NEO Iris® and Galileo NEO®. Test results
were evaluated for agreement between analyzers. Specimens with discordant results were
further tested with a commercially available particle agglutination assay for total antibody
(IgG and IgM) to CMV.

2. Matrix Comparison:
The clinical study performed in K183571 included data for EDTA
(Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid), CP2D (Citrate Phosphate Double Dextrose), CPDA-1
(Citrate Phosphate Dextrose Adenosine), ACD (Anticoagulant Citrate Dextrose), AS-1
(Additive Solution 1), AS-3 (Additive Solution 3) and AS-5 (Additive Solution 5) as
anticoagulants. The results demonstrated that these approved anticoagulants and additives
did not adversely affect the data collection or sample results. Each anticoagulant is listed in
the corresponding CMV package insert.
