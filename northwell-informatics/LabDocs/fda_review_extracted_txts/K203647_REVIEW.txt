III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.
The Immunalysis SEFRIA Methamphetamine Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay is an enzyme
immunoassay with a cutoff of 50 ng/mL in neat oral fluid collected by Quantisal or Quantisal II
Oral Fluid Collection Device. The assay is intended for the qualitative and semi-quantitative
analysis of methamphetamine in human oral fluid with clinical analyzers. This assay is calibrated
against d-methamphetamine.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate
dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass
Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The Immunalysis SEFRIA Methamphetamine Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in
order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
or Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any
test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The SEFRIATM Methamphetamine Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay was validated using the
Beckman Coulter AU480 chemistry analyzer. Confirmatory tests were run in the Agilent 6430
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The SEFRIA Oxycodone Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay consists of ready to use reagents for
use on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. The SEFRIA Oxycodone Oral Fluid Enzyme
Immunoassay is provided in two kit sizes by volume: 100 mL (621OF-0100K) and 500 mL
(621OF-0500K). Each kit box contains the following reagents:
• 1 X Enzyme Acceptor/Antibody Reagent (EA) - This contains EA protein and
recombinant
antibodies to oxycodone, in PIPES buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.
K203647 - Page 2 of 18

--- Page 3 ---
• 1 X Enzyme Donor/Substrate Reagent (ED) - This contains ED peptide labeled with
oxycodone and CPRG substrate in malic acid buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
The SEFRIA technology is based on artificial fragments of the E. coli enzyme β-galactosidase. A
mutant enzyme, termed Enzyme Acceptor (EA), is created by deletion of a short sequence in the
amino-terminal region of the sequence. EA is inactive, but can combine with peptides, termed
Enzyme Donors (ED’s), containing the deleted sequence, to form active β-galactosidase. This
process is termed complementation, and the active enzyme formed as a result can be measured
by hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate such as chlorophenol red β-D-galactopyranoside
(CPRG). The ED peptides can be modified by attachment of a derivative of methamphetamine,
which does not interfere with the formation of active β-galactosidase. However, antibodies to
methamphetamine bind to the ED- methamphetamine conjugate, and block complementation.
The assay is based on the competition of methamphetamine in an oral fluid sample with the ED-
methamphetamine conjugate for the fixed amount of antibody binding sites. In the absence of the
free drug in the sample, the antibody binds the ED-methamphetamine conjugate, resulting in
inhibition of enzyme formation. As the methamphetamine concentration in the sample increases,
ED-methamphetamine becomes available for complementation, creating a dose response
relationship between methamphetamine concentration in the oral fluid and enzyme formation.
The β-galactosidase activity is determined spectrophotometrically at 570 nm by the conversion
of CPRG (orange) to chlorophenol red (red) and galactose.

An additional 20-day study was performed on 3 lots of assay reagent to demonstrate the
repeatability across multiple reagent lots. All sample concentrations ranging from -100% to -
25% of the cutoff were negative and all sample concentrations ranging from +25% to +100%
of cutoff were positive for both qualitative and semi-quantitative interpretations.
2. Linearity:
Assay linearity was evaluated in the semi-quantitative mode by spiking a drug free oral fluid
pool with a high concentration of methamphetamine. Additional pools were made by serially
diluting the high concentration specimen with drug free oral fluid to achieve concentrations
ranging from 20 ng/mL to 220 ng/mL. The 0 ng/mL specimen was made from drug free oral
fluid. Each pool was collected by Quantisal and Quantisal II oral fluid collection devices and
tested in triplicate to calculate the mean concentration values that were used to calculate drug
recovery. The results in semi-quantitative mode are presented in the tables below.

Structurally and functionally similar compounds were spiked into drug free pooled oral fluid
at levels that will yield a result that is equivalent to the cutoff, if cross reacting. The study
assessed the cross reactivity of the methamphetamine assay to related drugs and drug
metabolites, in both the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Cross-reactivity test results

3. Interference – Structurally Unrelated Compounds
Structurally unrelated compounds were evaluated in qualitative and semi-quantitative
modes by spiking the potential interferent into drug free oral fluid containing
methamphetamine at ±25% of the cutoff. No interference was observed at the
concentrations tested with structurally unrelated compounds. The concentration levels of
structurally unrelated compounds tested are presented below.

Interference – Endogenous Compounds and Exogenous Compounds
Endogenous compounds and exogenous compounds were evaluated in qualitative and semi-
quantit modes by spiking the potential interferent into drug free oral fluid containing
methamphetamine at ±25% of the cutoff. Additional orally used products were tested by
collecting oral fluid using Qua and Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Devices from subjects
after use of the substances. At the l tested, there was no interference observed with endogenous
compounds, exogenous compounds an orally used compounds. Endogenous compounds and
exogenous compounds, along with orally used compounds tested are presented in the tables

Interference – pH
To evaluate potential interference from the effect of oral fluid pH, device performance in the
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of oral fluid pH values (3.0,
4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0). All test samples were prepared in drug free oral fluid
containing oxycodone at ±25% of the cutoff. At the pH levels tested, there was no interference
observed for each test mode.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range for the semi-quantitative mode is 20 ng/mL to 200 ng/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The assay is traceable to a commercially available, certified, standard material with the
concentration verified by GC-MS or LC-MS/MS.
Methamphetamine Stability in Oral Fluid
Drug free negative oral fluid spiked with methamphetamine at +50% of the 50 ng/mL cutoff
were collected and stored in Quantisal and Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Devices at 2°C
- 8°C, tested by LC-MS/MS at each time point and compared to the baseline concentration
result. The test results indicate that oral fluid samples containing methamphetamine are
stable for up to 12 months stored in Quantisal or Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device at
2°C - 8°C.
Data to support 10-day storage in Quantisal or Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Device at
ambient temperature 8°C - 25°C were reported in K183048 and K200801.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay cut-off cutoff for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of
methamphetamine in neat oral fluid is 50 ng/mL.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Eighty (80) deidentified, unaltered clinical oral fluid samples collected by using the
Quantisal and Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Devices were obtained from clinical
research facilities, analyzed for methamphetamine at assay cutoff with the SEFRIA
Methamphetamine Oral Fluid Enzyme Immunoassay in both qualitative and semi-
quantitative modes and compared to Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) results using the Agilent 6430 Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass
Spectrometry. Method comparison test results in qualitative and semi-quantitative modes
