B Indication(s) for Use:
Tidepool Loop, a mobile application with algorithm technology, is intended for use with
compatible integrated continuous glucose monitors (iCGM) and alternate controller enabled
(ACE) insulin infusion pumps to automatically increase, decrease, and suspend delivery of basal
insulin based on iCGM readings and predicted glucose values. It can also recommend, and with
the user’s confirmation, control the delivery of correction boluses when glucose values are
predicted to exceed user configurable thresholds.
Tidepool Loop is intended for the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in persons six years of
age and greater.
Tidepool Loop is intended for single patient use.
Tidepool Loop is Rx - For Prescription Use Only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Tidepool Loop should not be used by anyone who is unable to notice alerts, alarms, and
reminders because of physical limitations.
Tidepool Loop should not be used by anyone that is unable to monitor glucose as recommended
by their healthcare provider.
Tidepool Loop should not be used by anyone that is unable to maintain contact with their
healthcare provider.
Tidepool Loop should not be used during Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed
Tomography (CT) scan, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan, or high-frequency electrical
heat (diathermy) treatment. Components of the Tidepool Loop system may not have been tested
in magnetic fields and heat could damage the CGM or insulin pump being used with Tidepool
Loop and prevent accurate sensor glucose readings or accurate insulin delivery. This could result
in overdelivery or under-delivery of insulin, which can lead to low or high blood glucose. Please
follow Healthcare Provider instructions and refer to the individual component manuals for more
information.
Do not use Tidepool Loop in children under the the age of six years old. Tidepool Loop is not
indicated for use by anyone who is under the age of six years old and the performance of the
system in children under six is unknown.
Tidepool Loop is not indicated for use by anyone who is pregnant, on dialysis, or critically ill. It
is not known how different conditions or medications used in these scenarios may affect
performance of the Tidepool Loop system. CGM readings being used by the system may be
inaccurate in these cases, meaning the Tidepool Loop App will not have accurate information to
use for dosage recommendations. This could result in overdelivery or under-delivery of insulin,
which can lead to low and high blood glucose.
Do not take external insulin, such as manual insulin injections or inhaled insulins, while the
Tidepool Loop app and insulin pump are operational. Tidepool Loop does not receive
K203689 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
information about insulin taken outside the app. If you choose to take additional insulin with
another method while the app and insulin pump are working, overdelivery or under-delivery of
insulin may occur, which can lead to low and high blood glucose. Consult with your healthcare
provider about how long to wait after manually taking insulin before using Closed Loop Mode
with Tidepool Loop.
Do not use Tidepool Loop if you are taking GLP-1 agonists or SGLT-2 inhibitors, metformin, or
DPP-4. Tidepool Loop has not been tested in populations using additional diabetes medications
and the performance of the system in conjunction with these medications is unknown.
Do not use Tidepool Loop when using hydroxyurea, a medication used in the treatment of
diseases including cancer and sickle cell anemia. CGM readings being used by the system may
be inaccurate while taking hydroxyurea, meaning the Tidepool Loop App will not have accurate
information to use for dosage recommendations. This could result in overdelivery of insulin,
which can lead to hypoglycemia. Talk to your healthcare provider about using your BG meter for
treatment decisions instead.
ONLY use NovoLog or Humalog U-100 insulin in your Tidepool Loop-compatible insulin
pump. Tidepool Loop is designed to automate dosing of NovoLog or Humalog U-100 rapid-
acting insulin only.
Speak with your healthcare provider about lifestyle changes that may impact your overall insulin
needs and settings, such as weight gain or loss or starting or stopping new activities.
Only the particular iCGM and ACE pump devices specifically designated by Tidepool for
compatibility with the Tidepool Loop app may be used with the app.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Tidepool Loop is a software-only device intended for use by people with Type 1 diabetes. The
software algorithm resides on a mobile application that can be downloaded to qualified mobile
devices (e.g., iPhone) and connects to a compatible Alternate Controller Enabled insulin pump
(ACE pump) and a compatible integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM) to automatically
increase, decrease, and suspend delivery of basal insulin based on readings from the iCGM and
glucose values predicted by Tidepool Loop. By design, Tidepool Loop can only be used with
compatible iCGM and ACE Pump devices for which the Tidepool Loop has been validated for
use with. Tidepool Loop will not allow use of an unvalidated ACE pump or iCGM. There are
controls within the software to prevent use of Tidepool Loop in these cases.
Tidepool Loop uses the Tidepool Loop Bolus Recommendation Tool (TLBRT) in closed loop
mode, which can recommend, and, with the user’s confirmation, deliver correction boluses when
glucose values are predicted to exceed user configurable thresholds. Tidepool Loop predicts
glucose levels up to 6 hours in the future based on prior iCGM readings, insulin delivery history,
and user input (e.g., carbohydrate intake and exercise), and uses that prediction to adjust insulin
delivery. Tidepool Loop requires that users input their specific therapy settings, which are
K203689 - Page 3 of 13

--- Page 4 ---
established with the help of their health care provider before using the device, as part of the
prescription process. These settings include:
• Target Correction Ranges for normal operation, pre-meal, and workout presets
Settings can be programmed as low as 87 mg/dL and as high as 180 mg/dL and
o
different ranges can be added for different times of day.
• Glucose Safety Limit
Settings can be programmed as low as 67 mg/dL, or as high as 110 mg/dL or the
o
Correction Range minimum, whichever is lower.
• Carb to Insulin Ratios
• Insulin sensitivity factors
• Basal rates
• Max basal rate
• Max bolus
Tidepool Loop can be used to adjust or suspend basal insulin delivery every 5 minutes based on
actual CGM sensor and predicted glucose readings. iCGM values are automatically used by the
TLBRT when the Tidepool Loop Algorithm technology is active (i.e., when the device is
operating in closed-loop mode with an active iCGM sensor session). The TLBRT is disabled
when closed-loop mode is off, such as when it is manually disabled, or when there is no active
iCGM sensor session. The user will use Tidepool Loop’s simple bolus calculator, into which
iCGM values are not automatically populated into the glucose field.

Summary of Clinical Testing:
Tidepool Loop was derived from the open source, community-developed Do-It-Yourself (DIY)
Loop project. The Loop Observational Study was a real-world, virtual, observational study
conducted to collect data on the safety and effectiveness of Loop in both new and existing users
to support this premarket notification for Tidepool Loop. Users were recruited to enroll in the
observational study and provide their information related to algorithm use. The protocol allowed
enrollment of up to 1,250 participants of any age with Type 1 diabetes with a target of at least
300 participants and a minimum of 150 new Loop users.
The study enrolled subjects diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who were using insulin (either
pump therapy or multiple daily injections [MDI]) and currently used Loop or had plans to begin
using Loop for insulin delivery.
Participant baseline data were collected on web-based data collection forms including
demographic information, glycemic information (via continuous glucose monitoring data, if
available), and quality of life/psychosocial and treatment satisfaction surveys. During the study,
K203689 - Page 6 of 13

--- Page 7 ---
CGM and insulin dosing data were collected continuously and uploaded automatically from the
Tidepool Mobile app on a user’s own iPhone to the Tidepool cloud, from which it was retrieved
by the study coordinating center.
Participants completed weekly web-based surveys about Adverse Events (severe hypoglycemia,
DKA, hospitalization) and device issues. Participants were followed for up to 12 months, with
updates obtained after 3, 6, and 12 months that included web-based surveys on patient-reported
outcomes and psychosocial/quality-of-life aspects related to Loop use. Focus groups were also
completed.

Primary Study Safety Results
The Loop Observational Study did not exclude subjects with a prior history of severe
hypoglycemia (SH) or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The majority of severe adverse events
observed during the study were experienced by the minority of participants who also had at least
one severe hypoglycemic event in the three months before using DIY Loop. The tables below
summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemic events at baseline (i.e., at enrollment) and
follow-up by age group in the intended use population.

Human Factors
Human factors validation tests were conducted with Tidepool Loop installed on an iPhone. A
total of 9 formative studies were conducted; after each study, information was fed back into the
design of the User Interface. The summative human factors validation study was performed on
the final device design with fifty-one representative participants which included adults, and
children with their caregivers. All study participants received training that was consistent with
the training that patients would receive with the commercial product and interacted with the
device in a simulated use environment. Usability evaluations assessed comprehension and
usability of the device for critical device tasks. Results of the study demonstrated that the device
could be used safely by intended users.
User and Provider Training
Physician and user training as per the sponsor provided training materials is important to ensure
safe use of the device. The sponsor provided training materials for healthcare providers who will
prescribe this device and manage patients who use this device. The training covers how the
device works, details of the clinical study, setting up the device, and information on how to
assess patient results with the device.
A training plan for device users was also provided. The plan provides resources for various types
of users including new pump users, users switching from a different pump, and users upgrading
from a partner pump without Tidepool Loop to the same or similar partner ACE pump with
Tidepool Loop. The training includes initial start-up, troubleshooting, maintenance, and
management of the device. Training includes a follow-up 3-5 days after the initial training and
subsequent communication with that person’s healthcare provider to ensure ongoing follow-up
care.
Hazard Analysis:
A comprehensive hazard analysis was provided for this device, in which design inputs and
outputs, risks, and risk mitigations for software and interoperable hardware components
associated with the safe and effective functioning of the device were reviewed. The hazard
analysis provided in this submission accounted for the unique design elements, intended use, and
risks of the Tidepool Loop System design. In particular, this hazard analysis accounted for the
risks associated with interoperability between the software device developed by the sponsor and
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware device it was installed on, as well as with other third-
party interoperable devices. This analysis identified hazards which could reasonably be
anticipated to impact the proper use of the device, traced all identified risks to adequate design
controls, and demonstrated that design features were appropriately implemented and validated.
Data Logging
The sponsor provided software and bench testing to demonstrate that the device is able to record
critical events, including information related to its state (e.g., commanded delivery
rates/volumes, all algorithm calculations, open loop / closed loop mode, power on/off events),
user inputs, and device settings. In addition, the sponsor detailed the specific information that
they would collect from all interoperable components connected to the Tidepool Loop including
the iCGM and ACE pump components and described how Tidepool Loop will collect data from
those devices, how it stores that data, and how that data can be shared with the user, with
Tidepool, and with health care practitioners and caregivers. All log entries are time stamped, and
K203689 - Page 11 of 13

--- Page 12 ---
the logs are either generated when the events occur or every five minutes in the case of recording
algorithm calculations. These protocols were reviewed and found to be adequate.
Interoperability
A plan and approach for interoperability were provided according to the FDA Guidance “Design
Considerations and Pre-market Submission Recommendations for Interoperable Medical
Devices - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff” and determined to be
adequate to support and clearly specify expectations, requirements, and interface specifications
for potential interoperable devices. Specifically, the sponsor has established plans for both
proprietary and standards-based (leveraging relevant IEEE 11073 and Bluetooth SIG) plug-ins
for interfacing with ACE pumps and iCGMs. Further, the sponsor has performed software and
bench testing to verify and validate that these interface control specifications meet the special
controls and their controller’s requirements for performance, communications, and data logging.
In addition, the plans provided by the sponsor covered their approach to working with connected
device companies regarding contractual issues, interfaces for data communication and exchange,
and post-market reporting procedures and responsibilities (e.g., who is responsible for
investigating and reporting complaints, malfunctions, and adverse events). The approach was
determined to acceptably align with FDA-recognized ANSI/AAMI/UL 2800-1:2019 Standard
for Safety for Medical Device Interoperability.
The sponsor additionally provided software protocols intended to ensure secure, accurate, and
reliable communication with digital interfacing devices, as well as failsafe design features to
mitigate the risks associated with interruption of communication with digitally connected
devices. These protocols were executed in the comprehensive software testing performed by the
sponsor which included software test suites, hardware emulators, hardware prototype testing, and
software integration testing.
By design, Tidepool Loop can only be used with compatible iCGM and ACE Pump devices with
which it has been validated for use. Tidepool Loop will not allow use of an unvalidated ACE
pump or iCGM. There are controls within the software to prevent use of Tidepool Loop in these
cases. To support the future integration of compatible ACE pumps and iCGMs with Tidepool
Loop, the sponsor also provided protocols (SOP-0016, “Tidepool Loop Connected Device
Integration and Validation Process and Plan,” and SOP-0018, “Tidepool Loop Regulatory
Determination Process”) outlining their validation strategy for determining compatibility of new
devices with the Tidepool Loop. The protocols included pre-specified procedures, validation
strategies, and acceptance criteria for software, cybersecurity, device interoperability, human
factors, labeling, and training materials, with the anticipated features and specifications of ACE
pumps and iCGMs as these are anticipated changes foreseen at the time of the submission. These
protocols, along with the software testing conducted on software test suites, hardware simulators
and hardware emulators, were found to be adequate to support the robustness of the sponsor’s
software test protocols to validate future integration of digitally connected devices that meet the
pre-specified specifications and acceptance criteria. Tidepool Loop must not be distributed until
the pre-specified acceptance criteria in the SOPs are met. FDA has determined that when a
modification is made in accordance with SOP-0016, “Tidepool Loop Connected Device
Integration and Validation Process and Plan,” and SOP-0018, “Tidepool Loop Regulatory
Determination Process” and validation strategy described in this 510(k), then the modification
would not significantly affect safety or effectiveness of the device and no new 510(k) would be
required. Changes made that are inconsistent with the modifications described in SOP-0016 and
SOP-0018 that were reviewed in this submission could be significant modifications that could
K203689 - Page 12 of 13

--- Page 13 ---
significantly affect the safety and/or effectiveness of this device (e.g., such changes could
compromise the clinical functionality or performance specifications that are directly associated
with the intended use of the device), in which case a new premarket submission would be
required (see 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)).
Cybersecurity
Detailed information on cybersecurity of the device was reviewed and found to be acceptable.
The sponsor provided detailed information relating to the penetration testing conducted as part of
their cybersecurity evaluation. The sponsor provided a software bill of materials, which provided
details on all software used in the device and the COTS hardware platform that the Software-as-
a-Medical-device (SAMD) was installed on. This included all manufacturer-developed,
commercially licensed, open source, partner and off-the-shelf software components (including
firmware, as relevant), along with an identification of the hardware runtime environment in
which each resides, with relevant version and/or model information, as well as details on whether
each component was actively supported by its manufacturer or legacy licensed.
Postmarket Surveillance Study:
There is uncertainty remaining regarding the risk/benefit profile of the device when used in the
broader intended use population. While the premarket clinical study provided to support the
510(k) showed some benefits, the study included mostly white device users with relatively high
levels of education and income relative to the general use population, and it was not adequately
powered to assess differences in the rates of safety events (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis and severe
hypoglycemia). Furthermore, adolescents were underrepresented in the study. Accordingly, a
postmarket surveillance study will be ordered by FDA to confirm understanding of safety.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
