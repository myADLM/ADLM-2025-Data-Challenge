A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The NObreath® is a portable, non-invasive device for the measurement of Fractional Exhaled
Nitric Oxide (FeNO) in human breath. The production of nitric oxide is often found to be
increased in inflammatory conditions such as asthma. Measurement of FeNO by NObreath® is a
method to measure the decrease in FeNO concentration in asthma patients that often occurs after
treatment with anti-inflammatory pharmacological therapy, as an indication of the therapeutic
effect in patients with elevated FeNO levels.
The fractional NO concentration in expired breath (FeNO), can be measured by NObreath®
according to guidelines for NO measurement established by the American Thoracic Society.
NObreath® is intended for children, 7- 17 years, and adults 18 years and older. NObreath® 12
second test mode is for age 7 and up
NObreath® 10 second test mode is for ages 7-10 only who cannot successfully complete a 12
second test.
FeNO measurements provide the physician with means of evaluating an asthma patient's
response to anti- inflammatory therapy, as an adjunct to the established clinical and laboratory
assessments in asthma. The NObreath® cannot be used with infants or by children under the age
of 7 as measurement requires patient cooperation.
NObreath® should not be used in critical care, emergency care or in anesthesiology.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
NObreath®
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
NObreath® is a portable system for the non‐invasive, quantitative measurement of the
fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) in expired human breath (FeNO). The NObreath®
system is comprised of the main unit with AC adapter, a rechargeable battery, an electrochemical
NO sensor, disposable patient mouthpiece with filter. The device can connect to the PC via a
standard USB cable or wirelessly via Bluetooth.
K203695 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
For testing, the patient inhales deeply and slowly exhales for 10 or 12 seconds through the
patient filter. In approximately 12 seconds the NO concentration is displayed in parts per billion
(ppb). Results are processed using dedicated software. The device has built‐in system control
procedures and a Quality Check to be performed every 6 months.
The measurement principle is based on American Thoracic Society guidelines (ATS/ERS
Recommendations for Standardized Procedures for the Online and Offline Measurement of
Exhaled Lower Respiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal Nitric Oxide, 2005. Am J Respir Crit Care
Med. 2005;171:912-930). The last fraction of the exhalation is evaluated for average NO
concentration. NO is measured using electrochemical detection.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
NObreath®
2. Specimen Identification:
The test operator identifies the patient by name. The results can be saved to the patient’s file
which is set up prior to the measurement.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user obtains a breath sample by having the subject exhale into the device.
4. Calibration:
The NObreath® is initially calibrated in the factory but there is a calibration
accessory called a CaliBag which allows the user to calibrate the device. The device labeling
recommends that the device be calibrated annually.
5. Quality Control:
A two-level quality check should be performed on the NObreath® once every six months to
ensure the NObreath® is within specification.

devices using the concentrations 10, 25, 75, 200, 350 and 500ppb (N = 200 per
concentration; N=1200 in total).
The sponsor’s acceptance criteria for the precision experiment were: at FeNO concentrations
of ≤50 ppb, the standard deviation should be ≤ 5 ppb, and for FeNO concentrations >50 ppb,
the CV (Coefficient of Variation) should be ≤10%. The study showed that for FeNO
concentrations ≤50 ppb, all of the standard deviations observed were ≤ 1.6 ppb, and for
concentrations >50 ppb, all of the CVs observed were ≤ 4.7%.
Clinical precision
The clinical precision of the candidate device was evaluated in a mixed study population of
76 participants including 24 pediatric participants (ages 7-17 years) and 52 adults (18 years
and older). Participants were asked to obtain two NObreath® measurements with the
assistance of three health care professionals (HCPs), for a total of six NObreath® evaluations
per participant.
The clinical precision study was designed to capture the accuracy and precision of the
NObreath® device, therefore FeNO values acquired by subjects covered potential FeNO
values which would be observed in clinical practice. The within subject precision* was
assessed from this study population and is presented in the table below:

*Three subjects in the clinical precision study had a large variation between the
measurements. One subject was from the median concentration bin of >= 50 ppb and two
subjects were from the median concentration bin of 40 to <50 ppb. The % CV for these
subjects was 10.24%, 21.54%, and 14.17%. This table excludes data from these three
subjects.
2. Linearity:
A mixture of air and NO gas at 200 ppb was mixed to obtain eleven different NO
concentrations (5, 10, 15, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, and 500 ppb), and was connected
in line with the candidate device. Five replicate determinations of all concentrations were
tested on four devices in both 12 second (adult) and 10 second (child) modes. Results are
summarized below:

Effects of extreme temperature and relative humidity.
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the effect of different temperatures and humidity
conditions on the performance of the device. The following temperature / humidity
combinations were evaluated:
Adult Mode: 15°C / 20%, 15°C / 80%, 30°C / 20%, 30°C / 80%, 22°C / 37%
Child Mode: 15°C / 20%, 15°C / 80%, 35°C / 20%, 35°C / 80%, 22°C / 37%
The NO concentrations evaluated were 10, 25, 75, 200, 350 and 500 ppb.
The data was collected using two NObreath® devices and three replicates were performed
per device.
The sponsor’s acceptance criteria for this study were that for FeNO values ≤50 ppb the result
should be ±5 ppb and for FeNO values >50ppb the result should be ±10%.
The results of the study showed that for FeNO values ≤50 ppb the maximum deviation was 4
ppb and for FeNO values >50 ppb the maximum % difference was 9.5%.
The results of the study support the claimed operating conditions for the NObreath®: 15°C-
30°C, 20-80% RH.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference from endogenous and exogenous compounds
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate potential interference from endogenous and
exogenous compounds. Five devices were evaluated and the acceptance criteria were that the
bias is ≤ ± 5 ppb or 10% (whichever is greater) as compared to the control sample with no
added interferent.
The following potential interferents were evaluated in this study and determined not to
interfere with the results per the acceptance criteria:
Acetaldehyde, Acetonitrile, Acetone, Ammonia, Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide,
Ethanol, Hydrogen, Hydrogen Sulphide, Isoprene, Oxygen, Hydrogen peroxide, Nitrogen
dioxide.
A study was also conducted to investigate if there was any interference from exogenous
substances including mouthwash (with and without alcohol), carbonated soft drinks (with and
without caffeine), lozenges (with and without menthol), and toothpaste. Test subjects did not
consume any food and liquid 1 hour before the tests, and subjects did not smoke 1 hour

before the tests. The results were determined from the difference between the baseline FeNO
reading, and the FeNO reading measured after the subjects had ingested or used the potential
interferent. Three replicates were performed for each potential interferent from each of 10
test subjects. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria was that the results after using or ingesting
the potential interferent should be within ± 5 ppb or 10% (whichever is greater) when
compared to the control measurement. The study showed that the maximum observed
difference was 2.4 ppb for all potential interferents.
Effect of altitude
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate device performance at different simulated
altitudes. The FeNO concentrations evaluated were 0, 55, 110, 220, 300, 400, and 450 ppm.
The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were that when compared to the control, results should be
within ± 5 ppb or ± 10%, whichever is greater. The maximum deviation for the first criterion
was 3 ppb and the maximum percent difference for the second criterion was 7.3%.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The results of the sponsor’s detection limit and linearity studies support the claimed
measuring range of 5-500 ppb FeNO.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The sponsor purchases the calibrated NO from British Oxygen Corporation (BOC). BOC
provides a Certificate of Analysis (COA) with each cylinder. The BOC supplied COA states
that each sample is traceable to internationally recognized reference materials or
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of detection for the candidate device was determined based on CLSI EP17-A2. Ten
devices were tested at 3 ppb (50 replicates) and 5 ppb (50 replicates) and over three days.
Nitric oxide samples were mixed in a balance gas of simulated breath. The limit of detection
was calculated using the parametric option in CLSI EP17-A2, using the following formulas:
LoB=μB+1.645 σB and LoD=LoB+1.645 σS. The results of the limit of detection analysis
support the claimed detection limit of 5 ppb.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Please see Comparison Studies section below.
9. Carry-Over:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the potential for carryover from a high
concentration FeNO sample to a subsequent sample. Three devices were evaluated and the
K203695 - Page 7 of 10

--- Page 8 ---
FeNO concentrations applied to assess carryover in a negative sample ranged from
approximately 5 to 500 ppb. The results showed no carryover effect.

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The sponsor performed a study comparing a single FeNO measurement on the candidate and
predicate devices in 83 subjects.
Linear regression produced the following:
y = 0.9924x – 1.522
R2 = 0.9766
2. Matrix Comparison:
Not applicable. The assay can be run using breath samples only.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
The sponsor provided the results of a study to evaluate the clinical accuracy of the candidate
device.
A total of 186 patients (n= 95 18 years and older and n=91 7 to 17 years of age) participated
in a longitudinal study where measurements for FeNO, spirometry, and asthma control
questionnaires were completed at baseline (Visit 1) and two weeks later (Visit 2) after
therapeutic agents were administered.
For those with elevated initial FeNO defined by ATS >25ppb for adults and >20ppb for
children (total n=139), there was a fall in mean FeNO measured by NObreath® in patients
with elevated FeNO levels for combined adult and pediatric treatment population (n=139).
Results showed a mean change of -13.7 ppb (-27.7%) with a mean SD of 17.8.
The decline in FeNO was accompanied by the following changes in subjective and objective
asthma measures.
