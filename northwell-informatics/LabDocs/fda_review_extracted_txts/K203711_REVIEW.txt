D Special Instrument Requirements:
IWL2020 Meter
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the following:
- IWL2020 Meter (with two 3-volt lithium CR2032 batteries)
- IWL2020 Test Strips (may be sold separately)
- IWL2020 Control Solutions (Level 1 and Level 2, may be sold separately)
- Quick Start Guide
The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a handheld device that incorporates features
to aid in self-monitoring of blood glucose. The blood glucose results are displayed on the screen
and stored in the meter's memory, and may also be transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
wireless communication.
B Principle of Operation:
The IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System quantitatively measures glucose
amperometrically, and includes the enzyme on the test strip, FAD-dependent glucose
dehydrogenase (GDH), which converts the glucose in the blood to gluconolactone. When a drop
of whole blood is applied to the reaction cell on the test strip, glucose in the blood sample reacts
in the presence of GDH-FAD and a mediator. The electrons generated during this reaction are
detected by the meter. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration
of glucose in the blood and is converted to a glucose concentration. The glucose concentration is
displayed on the meter display for the user.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
IWL2020 Meter
K203711 - Page 3 of 12

--- Page 4 ---
2. Specimen Identification:
Capillary whole blood from the user's fingertip
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The system is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip. The whole
blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action. Samples are to be tested
immediately upon collection.
4. Calibration:
The IWL2020 meter is factory calibrated. No user calibration is required.
5. Quality Control:
IWL2020 control solutions (Level 1 and Level 2) are for use with the IWL2020 Blood
Glucose Monitoring System to check that the meters and test strips are working together
properly and that the test is performing correctly. The ranges for Level 1 and Level 2
controls are printed on the test strip container label. The meter automatically recognizes the
difference between the control solution and blood. Instructions on when to perform a control
test, details about the control solution, performing a control test, understanding out-of-range
control results are provided in the meter manual. Control solution ranges are printed on the
control solution package insert.

2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated using three test strip lots and 36 IWL2020 meters by testing 11
venous whole blood samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 5.6 to 627.8 mg/dL
(5.6, 14.8, 37.7, 58.4, 94.2, 127.1, 153.1, 211.0, 282.0, 471.6, 627.8 mg/dL). One run (across
all 36 meters) was performed with each sample type using each of the strip lots. The values
from the IWL2020 meter were compared with those obtained from the comparator method
(hexokinase reagent on the Roche Cobas c 501 analyzer). The results from regression
analysis are summarized below:
Test strip lot #1: y=1.080 x+2.3817; R2 = 0.9985
Test strip lot #2: y=1.06 x+1.0307; R2 = 0.9987
Test strip lot #3: y=1.06 x+0.6098; R2 = 0.9986
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to
600 mg/dL. The meter will display “LO” when the result is less than 20 mg/dL and “HI” when
result is greater than 600 mg/dL. The sponsor validated the “LO” and “HI” functions and
demonstrated that they functioned as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To assess potential interference, the sponsor used venous whole blood samples adjusted to
three different glucose levels of 60, 120, 250 mg/dL, split into control sample and test
samples. Various endogenous and exogenous substances were then added to the test sample
only. The % difference between the test and control sample was calculated and the
concentration tested at which no significant interference (defined as ± 10 mg/dL for glucose
concentrations < 100 mg/dL and ± 10% for glucose concentrations ≥ 100 mg/dL) was
observed is presented in the table below:

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:
– Abnormally high concentrations (greater than 5 mg/dL) of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may
cause inaccurate results. High-dose vitamin C therapy that would result in abnormally
high concentrations is typically prescribed by your healthcare professional. If you are not
sure if this applies to you, please check with your healthcare professional.
– Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing since xylose may cause
inaccurate results. Xylose absorption testing is performed under the supervision of a
doctor. Ask your doctor how long to wait after xylose testing before performing a blood
glucose test.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range
of 20 to 600 mg/dL.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values:
Traceability: According to the sponsor, the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is
traceable to the NIST Standard Reference Material (SRM) 917 glucose reference material. A
method comparison was performed using the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System
and hexokinase reagent on the Roche Cobas c 501 analyzer as the comparator method (see
section B.1).
Test Strip Stability: IWL2020 Test Strip stability assessed using real time stability studies.
The protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support
the labeling claims that the test strips are stable both closed (shelf life) and open-vial for
within 18 months when stored at the recommended storage temperatures of 39-86°F (4-30°C)
and 10-90% relative humidity (RH). The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test
strips.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
To assess the performance of the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the hands
of the intended users, the sponsor performed a study with 350 lay user participants. Users
obtained their own fingertip capillary sample and performed a glucose test using only the
labeling instructions provided in English. Three test strip lots were used in the study. Results
were analyzed by comparing blood glucose results from finger stick samples using the
IWL2020 meter, obtained by the lay users, against results obtained on the comparator
method (hexokinase reagent on the Roche Cobas c 501 analyzer) with samples obtained by a
trained technician. The samples ranged from 49 to 395 mg/dL as measured by the
comparator method. All samples used were unaltered. The results are summarized in the
tables below:
Results from glucose concentrations less than 75 mg/dL

Readability:
A Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted on the IWL2020 Meter Manual,
IWL2020 Test Strip Insert, and Quick Start Guide and the results demonstrated that the
labeling was written at lower than 8th grade level.
Accuracy at Extreme Glucose Values:
An additional study was conducted to assess the accuracy of the IWL2020 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System at the extreme low and high ends of the claimed measurement range
using 46 capillary whole blood samples with glucose concentrations below 80 mg/dL, and 56
samples greater than 250 mg/dL. Samples were altered by spiking or glycolysis in order to
obtain the appropriate glucose concentrations. Samples were tested with the IWL2020 Blood
Glucose Monitoring System with test strips from 3 lots and compared to the results obtained
using the comparator method (hexokinase reagent on the Roche Cobas c 501 analyzer). The
glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from 22 – 590 mg/dL, as measured by the
comparator method. Results are summarized below:

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1) Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using contrived venous whole
blood samples with hematocrit levels of 10 – 65% (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 42 (nominal), 45,
50, 55, 60, 65, 70%) spiked with glucose to achieve target concentrations between 30-50, 51-
110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400mg/dL. A total of 90 replicates per sample were performed
on IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitor and 3 test strip lots and the results on the candidate
system were compared to comparator method (hexokinase reagent on the Roche Cobas c 501
analyzer). The results demonstrated that the IWL2020 Blood Glucose Monitoring System
performs as intended with samples containing hematocrit concentrations spanning the
claimed hematocrit range of 10 – 65%.
2) Altitude Study: To evaluate the effects of altitude on the IWL2020 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System results, contrived venous whole blood samples were altered to five
glucose concentrations (60, 110, 160, 350 and 500 mg/dL) and tested at 10,000 ft feet above
sea level. Each venous whole blood glucose concentration was tested in duplicate using two
strip lots and five glucose meters per strip lot. The meter results (20 glucose measurements
for each glucose concentration) were compared to those obtained with the comparator
method (hexokinase reagent on the Roche Cobas c 501 analyzer, tested at 719 ft). The
results support the claims that the system functions as intended at altitudes up to the claimed

3) System Operating Conditions Testing: To evaluate device performance over varying
operating temperature and humidity conditions, contrived venous whole blood samples at
glucose concentrations (60-80, 105-135, and 225-275 mg/dL) were tested at temperatures
ranging from 4-45°C (39.2-113°F)and relative humidity from 10-90%. Conditions tested
included 4°C(39.2°F)/30% (relative humidity, r.h.), 4°C(39.2°F)/90% r.h., 10°C(50°F)/10%
r.h., 28°C(82.4°F)/90% r.h., 45°C(113°F)/10% r.h., and 45°C(113°F)/36% r.h, and meter
results compared to the comparator method. The results support the claimed range of
operating conditions: 6-44°C (42.8-111.2°F) and 10-90% relative humidity.
4) Flex Studies: Short sample detection, error codes for samples outside the measuring range,
sample perturbation, testing with used test strips, intermittent sampling was completed. The
testing performed demonstrated that the device is robust to short sample detection, sample
perturbation, testing with used test strips, intermittent sampling, and that an error message is
returned to the user if a used test strip is inserted into the meter.
5) Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for single patient use. A cleaning study
was performed by cleaning the meter with mild dishwashing liquid detergent and water.
Three test meters were subjected to 260 cleaning cycles, representing one cleaning per week
for five years. Three meters were used for control/reference purposes that were not subjected
to cleaning. The study demonstrated that cleaning the meter did not impact device durability
or function. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials compromising the
meter with the chosen disinfectant, Super Sani-Cloth (EPA registration #9480-4). Robustness
studies were also performed by the demonstrating that there was no change in performance or
external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles (representing
weekly disinfection for five years, the expected lifetime of the meter).
6) The sponsor has provided appropriate documentation certifying that acceptable electrical
safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed with the
candidate device, and that the system was found to be compliant.
7) Test strip lot release criteria: The test strip lot release protocols and criteria were reviewed and
found to be acceptable.
