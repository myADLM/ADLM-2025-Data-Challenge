III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
The SeptiCyte RAPID test is a gene expression assay using reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction to quantify the relative expression levels of host response genes isolated from whole blood
collected in the PAXgene Blood RNA Tube. The SeptiCyte RAPID test is used in conjunction
with clinical assessments and other laboratory findings as an aid to differentiate infection-positive
(sepsis) from infection-negative systemic inflammation in patients suspected of sepsis on their first
day of ICU admission. The SeptiCyte RAPID test generates a score (SeptiScore) that falls within
one of four discrete Interpretation Bands based on the increasing likelihood of infection-positive
systemic inflammation. SeptiCyte RAPID is intended for in-vitro diagnostic use on the Biocartis
Idylla System.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as Intended Use
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
SeptiCyte RAPID is designed to run on the Biocartis Idylla system, K163628
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The SeptiCyte RAPID is an in vitro diagnostic test for simultaneous amplification and detection of two
RNA transcripts (PLA2G7 and PLAC8) using total RNA extracted from human blood. The test has been
designed, manufactured, and validated for use on the Biocartis Idylla real-time PCR system. The
SeptiCyte RAPID test is performed with an Idylla Cartridge, a single-use, disposable, multi-chambered
fluidic cartridge that runs on the Biocartis Idylla System (K163628). All processing steps are automated
and occur within an Idylla Cartridge, including sample extraction/purification, RT-qPCR for the detection
and relative quantification of the two human mRNA targets PLAC8, PLA2G7. All cartridge steps in this
process, following the addition of the sample, are fully automated and completely integrated. Test results
(measured Cq values and calculated SeptiScore) are available in about 65 minutes.
The specimen used for the SeptiCyte RAPID is a sample of whole blood collected by venipuncture using
the PAXgene blood collection tubes within the PAXgene Blood RNA System (K042613). The cartridge
contains all of the necessary reagents to perform RNA isolation from the sample.
SeptiCyte RAPID uses quantitative, real-time determination of the amount of each transcript in the
sample based on the detection of fluorescence by the Biocartis Idylla qPCR instrument function. The
cartridge includes the reagents for reverse transcription and PCR. Transcripts PLAC8 and PLA2G7 are
amplified and quantified. These values are combined to produce the SeptiScore, which is interpreted by
means of four discrete bands. These four bands reflect a monotonically increasing likelihood of sepsis as
shown in the following figure:
K203748 - Page 2 of 21

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The SeptiCyte RAPID test employs a coupled reverse transcription - quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR) system to measure the expression levels of the host response genes PLA2G7 and
PLAC8 isolated from whole blood. Amplicons generated by the RT-qPCR process are detected and
quantitated by fluorescent dyes, upon exonucleolytic release of the dyes from oligonucleotide probes that
specifically bind to the amplicons. The test is configured to run on the Biocartis Idylla System. The assay-
specific software uses the measured PLA2G7 and PLAC8 Cq values to generate a SeptiScore, which falls
into one of four discrete sepsis probability bands, each representing an increased risk of sepsis.

Repeatability and intermediate precision of the SeptiCyte Rapid was evaluated at one laboratory.
Blood sample pools were constructed to yield High (~10), Medium (~6), or Low (~5) SeptiSCORE
values. Repeatability (within run precision) was tested with the low sample pool only, using within
run values from testing performed over three days with two operators, three instruments and one
cartridge lot. Results are summarized in the left-hand columns of Table 1 below. For intermediate
precision, identical replicates (prepared as aliquots from the blood sample pools) were tested. A total
of 144 runs were conducted, with 48 runs for each sample type (low medium, high), over a total of
12 days, using two different operators and three different instruments. Each operator made 24 runs on
each of the three sample types (L, M, H), and each operator’s 24 runs were parsed as follows: (2 runs/
day) x (4 days) x (3 instruments). On each instrument, 16 runs were conducted with each of the three
sample types (L, M, H). The 16 runs for a given instrument and given sample type were parsed as
follows: (2 runs/operator/day) x (2 operators) x (4 days). Results were also analyzed for each analyte
separately.
The sponsor’s acceptance criterion (SD < 0.5 units) was met for each component of precision, as well
as for the precision calculated across the combination of instruments, operators, and days.

The sponsor notes that a small Hook effect was noted at high WBC levels (> 25x106 WBC cells/ml;
however, this appears to be similar for both analytes and is compensated by score calculation which is
the difference of these two analytes.
These results are considered acceptable.
4. Detection limit
a. Limit of Blank:
Platelet reduced plasma was used to determine the Limit of Blank as the sponsor states that leukocyte
depleted blood used for the predicate was unavailable. Ten replicates of platelet reduced plasma did
not generate a PCR signal (Cq > 40) for PLA2G7 and, accordingly, did not generate a SeptiScore,
b. Limit of Detection
Different concentrations of white blood cells (WBC) from a single donor into a matrix consisting of
platelet-reduced plasma to determine the level at which a SeptiScore was generated, i.e., the LoD was
defined as the lowest titer for which at least 95% (19/20) WBC replicates generate a SeptiScore.

c. Limit of Quantitation
LoQ was defined as the lowest WBC concentration for which at least 95% of WBC replicates
generate a SeptiScore with a standard deviation of 1.0 or less; results indicated that the LoQ was
similar to the LoD at 0.025 x 106 WBC cells/ml.

The LoD observed is acceptable for clinical practice and would include all patient groups with the
exception of patients with severe neutropenia.
5. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a. Analytical Specificity:
Analytical specificity was tested by reactivity against blank samples and genomic DNA and both
transcripts are endogenous markers. For blank cartridges, 20/20 blank cartridges (PBS mixed with
PAXgene RNA stabilizer) generated undetermined or invalid SeptiScore values; 10 cartridges with no
sample added similarly generated undetermined or invalid SeptiScore values. External positive controls
run the same day generated expected results.

For reactivity against genomic DNA, testing was conducted on 10 replicates of each of two commercially
procured total human gDNA samples. Each lot was tested at 500 ng and 1000 ng input per reaction.
Table 6: Specimen Panel Characteristics and Expected Results
Sample Description Total Reps SeptiScore Expected?

gDNA #2 500ng 10 No
gDNA #1 1000ng 15 No
gDNA #2 1000ng 5 No
Total Assays 40
The SeptiCyte RAPID test produced invalid SeptiScore values for each of the 40 reactions run in this part
of the study, with no valid Cq values generated for any of the cartridges used to test the gDNA samples.
b. Interferants
A specimen panel was prepared by spiking potential interferents into pooled, PAXgene-stabilized blood
collected from healthy donors. The potential interferents were dissolved in appropriate solvents, and then
spiked into the PAXgene blood samples at concentrations higher than the maxima of their normal or
expected reference ranges. Three replicates were tested at each concentration of potential interferent and
compared to matched PAXgene blood controls (containing the appropriate solvent but no interferent). The
substances tested, concentration of each, and results are reproduced below in Table 7:

7. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a. Real-time Stability
Real-time stability studies are ongoing to support product claims. Real-time stability study protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
In-use stability
The performance of the SeptiCyte RAPID test cartridge was evaluated when removed from the pouch
and left on the lab bench for a period of time, both with and without the addition of sample to the
cartridge. Specifically, test cartridges were removed from their pouches and placed at 30°C and 75%
relative humidity for up to 3 days. No significant degradation in performance was observed and these
data support the sponsor’s recommendation in labeling that testing should be performed within one
hour of adding samples to the pouch.

b. Shipping Stability
Shipping simulations were performed to evaluate robustness of the SeptiCyte RAPID test to thermal
cycles as well as shocks and vibrations of a transport cycle when placed in the packaging used for
international shipping. To simulate thermal stress, cartridges were subjected to three winter cycles
and a summer cycle (2-3 days at -20°C followed by a day at 25°C for a winter cycle, and 3 days at
40°C for a summer cycle). Immediately after thermal stress, 6 cartridges were tested with PAXgene
citrate whole blood samples (900ul tested per cartridge). As with other stability studies, a maximum
drift of ±10% was considered acceptable. All samples evaluated are part of this study successfully
met the acceptance criteria. These results confirm that secondary packaging is sufficient to maintain
stable performance of the test for shipping conditions anticipated during distribution of the product.
c. PAXgene Sample Collection/Handling
The sample collection study evaluated stability of the test result both when samples were processed
either immediately after a blood draw or when frozen prior to testing. Blood samples were collected
from each of 15 healthy donors with the first sample processed in real-time and tested both
immediately and after a 120-minute incubation at room temperature to mimic the sample processing
conditions for the PAXgene sample tubes. Results from the stability test of freshly collected blood
samples demonstrated no significant differences in SeptiCyte score when evaluated immediately or
after a 120-minute incubation. These data support SeptiScore testing immediately after blood draw or
after sample processing according to the manufacture instructions for the PAXgene sample tube.
To support the use of banked frozen samples in their validation studies, the sponsor performed an
equivalency study between fresh and frozen specimens. Specimens processed immediately were
compared to paired samples that underwent one freeze thaw cycle and were stored for one month at
<-70°C. Across all evaluated samples, the mean Ct shift in the PLA2G7 transcript Cq was 0.26, the
mean shift in PLAC8 was 0.2, and the mean shift in SeptiScore was 0.06. Cumulatively, these results
demonstrate that a single freeze-thaw cycle did not significantly affect SeptiScore reported results.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical performance of the SeptiCyte Rapid was evaluated in a manner similar to that for the Septicyte
LAB predicate (K163260). Residual samples with sufficient volume remaining from the two
observational, non-interventional, prospective clinical trials (the Molecular Diagnosis and Risk
Stratification of Sepsis [MARS- NCT01905033] study and the Septic Gene Expression Using SeptiCyte
[VENUS - NCT02127502] study) used for validation of the Septicyte LAB predicate were tested. The
MARS and VENUS studies were conducted across eight clinical sites in the United States and Europe. Of
the original 447 subjects, PAXgene Blood RNA tubes were available for 356. This represented ~80% of
the original cohort: 139/198 of the sample from the MARS study (70.2% representation), 101/129 from
the original Venus sample (78.3% representation), and 116/120 of the subjects from the Venus
Supplement (96.7% representation).
An additional 30 prospective specimens were collected as part of the NEPTUNE (NEar PatienT
MolecUlar TestiNg in Sepsis, NEPTUNE) study. The NEPTUNE protocol was a prospective study
similar in design to the MARS and VENUS studies; however, this study was terminated early due to
difficulty enrollment with the onset of the COVID epidemic. Study protocols were similar enough that
combining subject results was considered acceptable.
For the retrospective studies, the primary objective was to determine the diagnostic performance of
SeptiCyte LAB in distinguishing sepsis from SIRS in adult critical care patients, either as a stand-alone
test or in combination with other clinical variables and laboratory assessments used to confirm or exclude
a diagnosis of sepsis. A “sepsis event” was defined operationally to have occurred when a patient
displayed two or more signs of systemic inflammation and was given therapeutic systemic antibiotics by
the attending clinician within 24 hours of ICU admission.
Adult critical care patients aged 18–89 years were considered qualified for enrollment if, upon admission
to an ICU, they displayed two or more of the following signs:
• temperature above 38oC or less than 36oC
• heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute
• tachypnea greater than 20 breaths per minute or PaCO2 less than 32 mm Hg
• White blood cell (WBC) count greater than 12,000/mm3 or less than 4,000/mm3 or greater than
10% immature neutrophils (bands).
Exclusion criteria included:
• Clinical cultures or serologic tests were not obtained when sepsis was suspected
• ICU admission more than 24 hours before trial enrollment
• Delay of more than 24 hours between trial enrollment and sample draw
• Treatment with antibiotics more than 24 hours before ICU admission for any reason other than
surgical prophylaxis (VENUS and Venus Supplement only), or
• Documented sepsis event that occurred more than 3 days before ICU admission or more than 2
days after ICU admission (MARS only).
The SeptiScore for each subject was compared to a Retrospective Physician Diagnosis (RPD) comparator
based on clinical case review by medical experts who independently reviewed clinical information about
each subject while remaining blinded to the SeptiCyte LAB results. Case reviews occurred after the
patient was discharged from the hospital. The RPD Case Review Panel based their diagnosis on clinical
data. RPD assessment and analyses were approached three ways (four in indeterminate as sepsis is
considered):
K203748 - Page 14 of 21

--- Page 15 ---
1. Forced RPD: Subjects were stratified by diagnosis (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome
(SIRS) or sepsis) according to the majority opinion of the RPD Case Review Panelists. The
category of Indeterminate was not allowed; all subjects were forced into either the SIRS or sepsis
categories, with no subjects excluded. The performance evaluation of the SeptiCyte LAB was
based on the Forced RPD.
2. Consensus RPD: Subjects were stratified by diagnosis (SIRS, sepsis or indeterminate) according
to the majority opinion of three expert reviewers. Indeterminate cases (n=37) were those for
which a definitive diagnosis could not be reached by expert review and were not included in the
analysis. Indeterminate as sepsis: An analysis where subjects with indeterminate results were
considered as sepsis was also included.
3. Unanimous RPD: the subset of subjects where all three assessments were in agreement
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the additional prospective subjects was similar to that for
retrospective subjects, as was the method for RPD diagnosis, allowing data to be effectively pooled.
The following is the summary of demographic data for the retrospective subjects from the sponsor’s

Figure 2: Probability of Sepsis by Band for Combined Prospective and Prospectively Archived
Samples.
Results are presented for (A) Forced, (B) Consensus, and (C) Unanimous RPD methods. The percentage
(prevalence) of sepsis is indicated for each Band with error bars representing 80% confidence intervals.
The number (N) of sepsis and SIRS in each Band is indicated to the right of the point estimate
(NSepsis:NSIRS) as determined by each RPD method. Results across all approaches to analyzing RPD
results are consistent, i.e., there is a clear relationship between SeptiScore and the increasing likelihood of
sepsis across each SeptiScore Interpretation Band.
Table 10 below presents the same results in tabular form:

Using a method identical to the analysis performed for the predicate K163260, results from the SeptiCyte
RAPID test were analyzed with a backwards-elimination (BW-Elimination) variable selection procedure,
combined with a logistic regression decision rule, for a subset of the clinical and laboratory variables
from the complete dataset (see Table 11 below). Area Under Curve (AUC) for SIRS versus sepsis was
used for assessing model performance for each analysis. Models were constructed using the Forced or
Consensus RPD and the top five clinical variables contributing to the AUC were identified. For all
logistic regression models, BW-Elimination and k-fold cross-validation were used to determine if the test

provided diagnostic clinical utility beyond that provided by other clinical variables and laboratory
assessments available within the first~24 hours of the suspicion of sepsis. The backward elimination
technique started with the full model including all independent variables. Models were constructed
including or excluding Procalcitonin (PCT). At each step, the effect showing the smallest contribution to
the model was deleted. The logistic regression model for discriminating between sepsis and SIRS found
SeptiScore to be the most significant variable for each model. This observation was found for both
Consensus RPD and Forced RPD.

D Clinical Cut-Off:
SeptiSCORE RAPID cut-off values were established prior to the clinical trial. The sponsor notes that the
original design goal was for three bands, with the following performance targets as based on ‘clinical
feedback and risk analysis’:
Band 1 Sensitivity ≥ 90%: Minimize the number of FN (patients with sepsis who would go
undetected, hence untreated)
Band 3 Specificity ≥ 80%: Minimize the number of FP (minimize sepsis overdiagnosis, leading to
unnecessary treatment)
Sensitivity and specificity were originally defined as follows:
Band 1 sensitivity = TPband1/2/(TPband1/2+FNband1/2)
Band 3 specificity = TNband2/3/(TNband2/3+FPband2/3)
Ranges for the band threshold point estimates were identified by testing PAXgene blood samples from a
Training cohort (N=198) of independent patients using pilot GMP-grade SeptiCyte RAPID cartridges.
The Training cohort consisted of the following:
1. A panel of 100 US samples banked from the VENUS clinical trial meeting the following criteria:
a. The sample set spanned the measurement range of the assay with representation of low,
medium, and high SeptiScores.
b. Comparison data were previously generated with the SeptiCyte LAB kit (predicate
device) for all of the selected specimens.
c. None of these samples were used in the clinical validation of SeptiCyte LAB or
SeptiCyte RAPID for the purposes of FDA 510(k) submission.
d. Three (3) samples from the VENUS portion of the Training cohort were excluded from
the final threshold analysis/selection as they obtained an “indeterminate” diagnosis from
the retrospective physician panel. These indeterminate samples were only included in the
platform comparison to establish the direct correlation between test thresholds.
2. A panel of 98 European clinical samples collected from the MARS clinical trial. The UMCU
clinical sample cohort was selected on the basis of clinical data related to the patients’ ICU stay.
The diagnostic classification of each patient was made based on the infection likelihood of the
patient, retrospectively determined by a panel of UMCU physicians, and linked to a sepsis event
within 24 hours prior to or 24 hours after ICU admission. Subjects included 46 sepsis cases (23
culture proven, and 23 probable infections based on infection likelihood) and 52 SIRS cases.
Indeterminate cases (infection likelihood “possible”) were not included.
Thresholds for SeptiCyte RAPID were determined and locked in a two-part study using pilot GMP-grade
cartridges. Part 1 was a correlation/method comparison analysis to determine a direct relationship
between the scores, bands, and thresholds for SeptiCyte LAB (predicate device) and SeptiCyte RAPID
(new device). Part 2 was a resampling-based threshold analysis using training set to determine final
locked thresholds.
The three SeptiScore interpretation bands that were resolved had the following cut points:
Band 1: [0, 4.95)
Band 2: [4.95, 7.35)
Band 3: [7.35, 15]
K203748 - Page 19 of 21

However, subsequent analysis of the prospectively archived/retrospective study showed a large
percentage of subjects in Band 2, which also substantially overlapped the reference range obtained from
studies of healthy volunteers. Accordingly, to improve clinical interpretation, banding was subsequently
revised to a 4 Band interpretation consistent with the predicate device by evenly splitting the
“Intermediate” band of into two bands, as shown below in Table 12.

2 5.0 to 6.1
2 5.0 to 7.3
3 6.2 to 7.3
3 7.4 to 15 4 7.4 to 15
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The sponsor studied references ranges in a cohort of 119 ‘presumably healthy individuals’ > 20 years of
age balanced by sex (male/female) and race/ethnicity (White, African American, Asian, and Hispanic).
Samples were obtained at a single site, Discovery Life Sciences; Huntsville, AL. Results are summarized

This information is essential for proper use of this device and has been included as a section in the device
labeling, as well as incorporated into limitations in the labeling for the device. Test results for the device
include the following interpretation note:
Increased scores were observed in African Americans relative to other racial/ethnic groups, in the
clinical study of patients suspected of sepsis. For African-American subjects, only Band 4
showed a higher likelihood of Sepsis versus SIRS.
