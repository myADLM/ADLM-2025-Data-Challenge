III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Urea Nitrogen2 assay is used for the quantitation of Urea Nitrogen in human serum, plasma,
or urine on the ARCHITECT c System.
The Urea Nitrogen2 assay is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of certain renal
and metabolic diseases.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Architect c8000 System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Urea Nitrogen2 assay is comprised of a reagent kit that is run on the ARCHITECT c8000
System. The kit has the following reagents:
Reagent 1 (R1)
Active ingredient: β-NADH (1.915 g/L). Preservative: sodium azide.
Reagent 2 (R2)
Active ingredients: α-ketoglutaric acid (13.149 g/L), GLDH (60.000 KU/L), and urease (10.000
KU/L). Preservative: sodium azide.
B Principle of Operation:
The Urea Nitrogen2 assay is a modification of a totally enzymatic procedure as a kinetic assay in
which the initial rate of the reaction is linear for a limited period of time. Urea in the sample is
hydrolyzed by urease to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The second reaction, catalyzed by
glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), converts ammonia and α-ketoglutarate to glutamate and
water with the concurrent oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Two moles of NADH are oxidized for each mole of
urea present. The initial rate of decrease in absorbance at 340 nm is proportional to the urea
concentration in the sample.

Testing was performed according to the CLSI EP5-A3 guideline, on 2 levels of control, 3
contrived human serum and 3 human contrived urine panels (A,B,C). Testing was conducted
using 3 lots of the Urea Nitrogen2 reagent, 3 lots of Calibrator, 1 lot of commercially

2. Linearity:
Linearity studies were conducted by using serum and urine samples. Twelve levels of
dilutions spanning the measuring range were prepared by mixing different proportions of
samples with high and low level Urea Nitrogen analyte concentrations. Samples were
analyzed on one Architect c 8000 instrument in duplicate. The mean result for each sample
comprised the observed result and was compared to the expected result. The data was
analyzed using linear regression ; the best-fitting model was quadratic.

Nitrogen Urine 1.0058 3 1.000 2-2373 16-1991
Sample Dilution Study:
To support the claimed extended measuring interval (EMI) for serum samples, five human
serum samples were prepared to target concentration values of 150, 214, 278, 342 and 405
mg/dL. Samples were tested using the automated and manual dilution labeling instructions on
the ARCHITECT c8000 System with one reagent lot for a total of 30 replicates (2
instruments x 3 runs/instrument x 5 replicates/run). The % dilution recovery values for serum
ranged from 99.7% to 101.5% for the auto-diluted samples and from 101.6% to 103.5% for
the manually diluted samples, when compared to expected values. The total % CV ranged
from 1.1% to 1.7% for auto-diluted samples and 0.8% to 1.7% for manually diluted samples.
The study results support that serum samples with concentrations above 125 mg/dL may be
diluted 1:5 either manually or on-board the analyzer to obtain results up to 625 mg/dL.
Automated or manual sample dilutions have not been evaluated for the Urea Nitrogen2
assay urine application.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed based on guidance from the CLSI document EP07 3rd
ed. Specimens consisted of human serum and urine representing low and high concentrations
of the analyte, with and without the substance tested for interference. Each sample was
divided into 2 aliquots: one aliquot for the test sample and one aliquot for the reference
sample and tested in 10 replicates on one Architect c8000 analyzer with one reagent lot.
Serum samples were tested at urea nitrogen concentrations of approximately 10 and 30
mg/dL, and urine samples were tested at urea nitrogen concentrations of 700 and 1500
mg/dL. The sponsor stated that interference was considered to be non-significant if the
difference between the samples with and without interferent was less or equal to ± 10%.
The following tables list the highest concentration of each substance at which no significant
interference was found.

Limit of Blank (LoB):
The LoB was determined by testing zero-analyte serum and urine samples, 10 replicates, 3
lots of reagent on 2 instruments over three days for a total of 60 measurements per lot. The
95th percentile of the zero-analyte sample concentrations was calculated. Using the
parametric approach, LoB was derived from the 95th percentile of a normal distribution from
n ≥ 60 replicates of zero-analyte samples.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
The LoD was determined by testing 12 low analyte samples and 12 low analyte urine
samples, in 10 replicates per day using 3 lots of reagent on 2 instruments for three days for a
total of 60 measurements per lot. The data was analyzed to calculate the LoD using a
parametric analysis. The LoD represents the lowest concentration at which the analyte can be
detected with 95% probability based on n ≥ 60 replicates of low-analyte level samples.
Limit of Quantification (LoQ):
The LoQ was determined by testing five samples in replicates of 10 using 3 lots of reagent
on 2 instruments over three days for a total of 60 measurements. The LoQ was considered
acceptable if it was ≤ 3 mg/dL for the serum/plasma application. The sponsor defined the
LoQ as the lowest analyte concentration where the %CV was ≤ 20%.
The detection limit results are summarized as follows:
Serum Urine
LoB 1 mg/dL 6 mg/dL
LoD 2 mg/dL 11 mg/dL

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted by testing 124 serum samples and 121 urine
samples (n=121/124) on the candidate and predicate devices. Two of the serum samples and
4 of the urine samples were contrived. For the candidate device, samples were tested
internally using 3 lots of reagents and 1 lot each of calibrator and controls across 2
ARCHITECT c8000 instruments. For the predicate device, samples were tested internally
using 1 lot each of reagents, calibrator, and controls across 2 ARCHITECT c8000
instruments. Each sample was tested in a minimum of 2 replicates using both methods and
testing occurred over a minimum of 3 calendar days.
A Passing-Bablok evaluation was performed by comparing the first replicate result from the
candidate device versus the mean result from the predicate device.

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed to evaluate the suitability of specific blood
collection tube types for use with the Urea Nitrogen2 assay. Donor matched specimens were
drawn into tubes of below listed anticoagulant. A total of 64 samples were tested using 1 lot
of the Urea Nitrogen2 reagent, 1 lot of the Consolidated Chemistry Calibrator, 1 lot of
commercially available controls, and 1 instrument. The first replica result of the test tube
type was used for comparison to the mean of the 3 replicas for the control tube type (serum).
The results are summarized as follows, and support the claimed use of lithium heparin
plasma, lithium heparin (separator tube) plasma, serum (separator tube), and sodium heparin
plasma with the Urea Nitrogen2 assay:
