III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator is software intended for the management of diabetes in
persons aged 6 and older requiring rapid-acting U-100 insulin. The Omnipod 5 SmartBolus
Calculator calculates a suggested bolus dose based on user-entered carbohydrates, most recent
sensor glucose reading (or blood glucose reading if using fingerstick), rate of change of the
sensor glucose (if applicable), insulin on board (IOB), and programmable correction factor,
insulin to carbohydrate ratio, and target glucose value. The Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator is
intended for single patient, home use and requires a prescription.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
This device resides in the Omnipod 5 App and requires the App to function
The Omnipod 5 SmartBolus works with the following rapid-acting U-100 insulins. : NovoLog®
(insulin aspart), Humalog® (insulin lispro), and Admelog® (insulin lispro).
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator is a software device that resides in the Omnipod 5 App.
It requires input parameters and settings from the SmartAdjust Technology, an interoperable
automated glycemic (iAGC) and glucose values from a compatible integrated continuous glucose
monitoring system (iCGM) or blood glucose (BG) values from a blood glucose meter to
calculate suggested insulin bolus doses. The Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator can be used in
both open-loop (manual mode) and closed-loop (automated mode). When used with a compatible
iCGM, the Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator can use the sensor glucose values and trend
information to calculate a suggested bolus dose. When the Omnipod 5 SmartBolus Calculator is
used with manually entered BG readings it suggests a bolus dose based on the same calculations
as the currently cleared Omnipod DASH Insulin Management System bolus calculator
(K180045, K192659).

B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Summary of Clinical Testing:
A single-arm, multicenter, prospective clinical study was conducted to evaluate the Omnipod 5
SmartBolus Calculator in patients with type 1 diabetes during Manual Mode operation. The
study enrolled 25 evaluable subjects aged 6-70 years across 3 clinical sites, and consisted of two
7-day outpatient phases of Omnipod 5 use:
• Phase 1: 7 days of Omnipod 5 use in Manual Mode without a connected CGM using manual
entry of BG values to deliver boluses, followed by;
• Phase 2: 7 days of Omnipod 5 use in Manual Mode with a connected CGM using the CGM-
informed bolus calculator to deliver boluses.
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of the CGM-informed bolus
calculator using glucose metrics of percentage of time < 70 mg/dL and percentage of time > 180
mg/dL during the 4-hour post bolus period from Phase 1 as compared to Phase 2. Data from the
clinical study is presented in the tables below. In the 25 subjects enrolled in the combined age
cohort of 6.0-70.0 years, there were zero (0) deaths and zero (0) unanticipated adverse device
effects (UADE) reported. One (1) serious adverse event (SAE) was reported that occurred in the
aged 18.0-70.0 years cohort and was indicated as not related to the study procedures or study
device. There were no non-serious adverse events reported.

In Silico Testing: Simulations of possible input and output combinations were run to supplement
information collected in the clinical study. These simulations evaluated additional types and/or
ranges of variables in order to assess that potential edge cases (including physiologically
improbable edge cases) will produce either a safe output (e.g., bolus recommendation), or an
error alerting the user to an unsafe condition.
