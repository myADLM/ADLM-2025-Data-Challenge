decrease, and pause delivery of insulin based on current and predicted glucose values.
SmartAdjust technology is intended for the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in persons 6
years of age and older. SmartAdjust technology is intended for single patient use and requires a
prescription.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
SmartAdjust technology should not be used in anyone under the age of 6 years old. SmartAdjust
technology should also NOT be used in people who require less than 6 units of insulin per day as
the safety of the technology has not been evaluated in this population.
Do not use SmartAdjust technology in pregnant women, critically ill patients, and those on
dialysis. The safety of the SmartAdjust technology has not been evaluated in these populations.
Do not use SmartAdjust technology if you are taking hydroxyurea as it could lead to falsely
elevated CGM values and result in over-delivery of insulin that can lead to severe hypoglycemia.
Do not use SmartAdjust technology if you do NOT have adequate hearing and/or vision to allow
recognition of all functions of the Omnipod 5 System, including alerts, alarms, and reminders.
SmartAdjust technology used with the Omnipod 5 System is designed to use rapid-acting U-100
insulins. The following U-100 rapid-acting insulin analogs have been tested and found to be safe
for use in the Pod: NovoLog® (insulin aspart), Humalog® (insulin lispro), and Admelog®
(insulin lispro) for use up to 72 hours (3 days). Before using a different insulin with the Omnipod
5 System, check the insulin drug label and consult your healthcare provider. Refer to the insulin
labeling and follow your healthcare provider’s directions for how often to replace the Pod.
SmartAdjust technology used with the Omnipod 5 System relies on accurate, current CGM
values to determine your insulin needs. Always make sure you are using the CGM per
manufacturer's instructions and do not extend the sensor wear beyond the recommended
duration.
Do NOT attempt to use the SmartAdjust technology with the Omnipod 5 System before you
receive training. Inadequate training could put your health and safety at risk.
Device components used with the SmartAdjust technology including the pod, CGM transmitter,
and CGM sensor must be removed before Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed
Tomography (CT) scan, or diathermy treatment. In addition, the SmartAdjust Controller and
smartphone should be placed outside of the precedure room. Exposure to MRI, CT, or diathery
treatment can damage the components.
At the time of device authorization, the compatible integrated continuous glucose monitor
(iCGM) is the Dexcom G6 iCGM.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
SmartAdjust technology (the Omnipod 5 interoperable automated glycemic controller, or iAGC)
is a software-only medical device intended for the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The
Omnipod 5 iAGC uses data from a connected iCGM along with user-defined parameters to
predict future glucose trends and automatically increase, decrease, or pause the delivery of
insulin via a compatible alternate controller enabled (ACE) pump.
The SmartAdjust technology software is part of the Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery
System, which also includes the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump (K203768), Omnipod 5 Bolus
Calculator (K203772), and an integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM, Dexcom G6). The
SmartAdjust technology is intended to be digitally connected to an iCGM and an ACE Pump.
The SmartAdjust technology software resides on the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump (the Omnipod 5 Pod
and Omnipod 5 App). The iAGC software is responsible for controlling insulin delivery via
compatible ACE Pump when the system is in Automated Mode. iCGM data is transmitted from
the iCGM to the ACE Pump via Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The SmartAdjust technology
uses this transmitted iCGM data in its calculations. The SmartAdjust technology can be turned
off, and the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump will operate in Manual Mode, which delivers insulin based
on healthcare provider (HCP) or user-defined basal programs.
The SmartAdjust technology has three states of operation: Automated Mode, Automated:
Limited, and Activity. In Automated Mode, the system calculates insulin delivery every 5
minutes based on the user-customizable glucose target (110–150 mg/dL). Automated: Limited is
enabled when the SmartAdjust technology is not receiving data from a connected iCGM for 20
minutes or more and during sensor warm-up. While in Automated: Limited, the user will receive
no more than pre-programmed basal insulin. When a valid glucose value is received from the
iCGM, the SmartAdjust technology will resume delivery of insulin in full Automated Mode.
Activity is a temporary mode which the user may select for various time durations during
automated mode up to 24 hours. With Activity, the algorithm reduces insulin delivery, by setting
a temporary glucose target to 150mg/dL. Activity is intended for use during periods when insulin
sensitivity is expected to be higher, such as during exercise.

--- Page 7 ---
Study Feature Description
For the standard therapy (ST) phase, current Dexcom G6
iCGM users could provide data from a 14-day period within
the last 30 days. For non-G6 users, subjects wore a study
iCGM, in blinded mode, to record glucose measurements over
14 days while subjects managed their diabetes at home per
their usual routine and remained on their current multiple
daily injection (MDI) or pump therapy, and sensor, if
applicable.
After completion of the standard therapy phase, subjects were
trained on the system and transitioned to the hybrid closed-
loop (HCL) phase initiating treatment with the Omnipod
Horizon™ System. For the hybrid closed-loop phase, subjects
were divided into two groups:
Group 1:
N=16 subjects aged 6.0-70.0 years participated in the hybrid
closed-loop phase for the first 2-days while in a supervised
hotel/rental house environment and then transitioned to a 12
day outpatient environment.
• N=8 subjects aged 6.0-13.9 years
• N=8 subjects aged 14.0-70.0 years
Group 2:
N=20 subjects aged 6.0-70.0 years participated in the hybrid
closed-loop phase in a 14 day outpatient environment with
• N=10 subjects aged 6.0-13.9 years
• N=10 subjects aged 14.0-70.0 years
After all subjects from the first group completed the 2 day
hotel phase, the second group of subjects could commence
hybrid closed-loop.
All subjects participated in target glucose challenges during
the hybrid closed-loop phase. In total, all subjects completed
14 days of hybrid closed-loop, with approximately 72 hours
spent at each target blood glucose challenge level of 130
mg/dL, 140 mg/dL and 150 mg/dL.
Clinical site staff received alerts through a remote monitoring
system during the study for real-time assessments of subject
safety.
After each subject in the pre-pivotal study successfully
completed 14 days of hybrid-closed loop, they could
immediately enroll into the pivotal study.

3. 14 day outpatient therapy phase (Phase 1)
4. 13 week outpatient hybrid closed-loop phase (Phase 2)
5. Hybrid closed-loop extension phase (Phase 3)
Current and non-Dexcom G6 iCGM users who did not meet
the minimum CGM data requirements participated in Phase 1
(where subjects managed their diabetes at home per their
usual routine and remained on their current MDI or pump
therapy, and sensor, if applicable). After completion of the
standard therapy phase, subjects were trained on the system
and transitioned to Phase 2 initiating treatment with the
Omnipod Horizon System. Subjects in each cohort (ages 6-
13.9 and 14-70 years) participated in prescribed challenges
during any consecutive 5-day period during Phase 2 of the
hybrid closed-loop phase. Subjects who completed Phase 2
could commence their participation in Phase 3.

Pivotal Study Safety Results
One (1) DKA, and 3 SH events were reported during the study and included:
• One (1) DKA and 1 SH occurred in the aged 6.0-13.9 years cohort
• Two (2) SH occurred in the 14.0-70.0 years cohort.
The DKA event was indicated as possibly related to the study device and not related to the study
procedures while all other serious adverse events were indicated as not related to the device and
not related to the study procedures.
The table below provides a full list of the adverse events that occurred during the 3-month
Omnipod 5 System treatment phase. There were 3 severe hypoglycemia events not attributable to
the Omnipod 5 System automated insulin delivery or system malfunction and 1 DKA event from
a suspected infusion site failure. Other related, but non-glycemic adverse events included
infection or irritation at infusion site (2 children, 2 adults).

a. Human Factors Testing
Human factors validation tests were conducted with the Omnipod 5 App installed on a
compatible mobile device with interoperable technology. A total of 7 formative studies
were conducted; after each study, information was fed back into the design of the User
Interface. The final device design was evaluated in the summative study performed with
64 representative participants interacting with the device in a simulated use environment.
All study participants received training that was consistent with the training that patients
would receive with the commercial product. Usability evaluations assessed
comprehension and usability of the device for critical device tasks. Results of the study
demonstrated that the device could be used safely by intended users in the intended use
environment when used in combination with a digitally connected device.
b. Insulin Compatibility:
The SmartAdjust technology used with the Omnipod 5 System is designed to use rapid-
acting U-100 insulins including: NovoLog® (insulin aspart), Humalog® (insulin
lispro), and Admelog® (insulin lispro). These insulins were used in the pivotal clinical
study for this device and no other insulins have been tested for use with the device.
c. Data Logging:
Software verification testing has demonstrated the device records timestamped critical
events, including information related to its state, user inputs, and device settings, as
required by the special controls.

d. Interoperability:
A plan and approach for interoperability were provided according to the FDA Guidance
“Design Considerations and Pre-market Submission Recommendations for Interoperable
Medical Devices - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff” and
determined to be adequate to support and clearly specify expectations, requirements, and
interface specifications to potential interoperable devices. In addition, the plans provided by
the sponsor covered their approach to working with connected device companies regarding
contractual issues, interfaces for data communication and exchange, and post-market
reporting procedures and responsibilities (e.g., who is responsible for investigating and
reporting complaints, malfunctions, and adverse events).
The sponsor additionally provided validated software protocols intended to ensure secure,
accurate, and reliable communication with digital interfacing devices, as well as failsafe
design features to mitigate the risks associated with interruption of communication with
digitally connected devices. These protocols were reviewed and found to be adequate.
e. Cybersecurity:
Detailed information on cybersecurity of the device was reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The sponsor also provided a software bill of materials, which provided details on
all software used in the device and the hardware platform that the device was installed on.
This included all manufacturer-developed, commercially licensed, open source, and off-the-
shelf software components (including firmware as relevant), along with an identification of
the hardware runtime environment in which each resides, with relevant version and/or model
information, as well as details on whether each component was actively supported by its
manufacturer or legacy licensed.
f. Postmarket Surveillance Study
There is uncertainty remaining regarding the risk/benefit profile of the device when used in
the broader intended use population. While the premarket clinical study provided to support
the 510(k) showed some benefits, it was not adequately powered to assess differences in the
rates of safety events (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia).
Accordingly, a postmarket surveillance study will be ordered by FDA to confirm
understanding of safety.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
