See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS) is an automated digital slide creation, viewing,
and management system. The PIPS is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the
pathologist to review and interpret digital images of surgical pathology slides prepared from
formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. The PIPS is not intended for use with frozen
section, cytology, or non-FFPE hematopathology specimens.
The PIPS comprises the Image Management System (IMS), the Ultra Fast Scanner (UFS) and
display. The PIPS is for creation and viewing of digital images of scanned glass slides that would
otherwise be appropriate for manual visualization by conventional light microscopy. It is the
responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate procedures and safeguards to
assure the validity of the interpretation of images obtained using PIPS.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS) is an automated digital slide creation, viewing, and
management system. PIPS consists of two subsystems and a display component:
Ultra-Fast Scanner (UFS): There are no major changes to the UFS cleared under K172174. In
summary, the UFS subsystem scans cover-slipped glass slides at 40x magnification to produce
high-quality Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of the tissue material mounted on the glass slides. The
slides are placed in racks which are then placed in rack slots in the UFS. The scanning procedure
requires minimal user interaction. The UFS has a loading capacity for large batches (up to 300
slides). On the touchscreen the scanning progress is shown. Proprietary software is used for
image processing during acquisition. Philips’ proprietary format, iSyntax, is used to store and
transmit the images between the UFS and the IMS. The UFS consists of optical, mechanical and
electronic elements as well as software components. The UFS is located and operated on site in
healthcare institutions such as clinical pathology laboratories, etc.
Image Management System (IMS): The IMS is a software only subsystem and consists of the
IMS Application Server and Storage software and IMS Viewer software installed on compatible
server hardware. Functionality of the IMS includes the ability to view WSIs, organize workload,
and annotate and bookmark scanned WSIs. The IMS Viewer will operate in the user's work
environment using the display (component of the PIPS) to display WSIs. The IMS Application
Server and Storage software will operate in a controlled environment, typically a server room
separate from the pathology departments. One or more client computers with intranet/internet
connection to the IMS, meeting the minimum requirements (see Table 16-3 and Table 16-4 of
Section 16.3.1), and display are required for viewing images from the IMS. Client computers are
K203845 - Page 2 of 7

--- Page 3 ---
not part of the PIPS and will either be located in healthcare institutions such as clinical pathology
laboratories, etc. or in a pathology office.
Client-Side Rendering: Image processing is performed at the client computer (i.e., client-side
rendering) instead of at the server side. Client-side rendering utilizes Web Graphics Library
(WebGL), which is a JavaScript Application Programming Interface (API), for image processing
within a browser. WebGL allows using the computational power of a Graphics Processing Unit
(GPU) on the client computer. Offloading image processing to the GPU speeds up rendering. A
Philips service engineer can only configure the server or client-side rendering option. This option
is called “Use my computer for image processing”. When the option “Use my computer for
image processing” is enabled, additional requirements with respect to the Video Card are
applicable as follows: Video card minimum specifications - GPU Memory: 4GB; GeForce GTX
1050 Ti or similar; Memory bandwidth: 112 GB/s. The recommended browser for client-side
rendering is Chrome.
Philips PP27QHD Display: There are no changes introduced for the display. In summary, the
Philips PP27QHD display is connected to a client computer with access to the IMS Viewer. The
display is calibrated using the built-in calibration sensor and software tool, which perform
automatically a periodic calibration. The pathologist uses the display for viewing WSIs using the
IMS Viewer software.

B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
The K203845 was submitted to seek clearance for one significant change, the client-side
rendering to the Image Management System (IMS), the software subsystem of the Philips
IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS, K192259).
Verification testing activities have been performed to support the substantial equivalence
determination for the modified IMS containing the client-side rendering change which included:
1. A pixel comparison test to determine pixel equivalence using the ‘Regression SingleTest’
methodology that loads a reference image and reads the displayed pixel from the user
interface into a test image to verify that the displayed RGB output values of each pixel are
identical with the reference image input.
Reference Data Set: A Reference Data Set is created by importing a set of 85 Whole Slide
Images (WSIs) in a clinically validated product and storing from the pixels from 3377
selected regions of these WSIs in png images (i.e. reference png image) with 1.2*109 pixels.
Test acceptance criteria: The displayed RGB output values of each pixel in the test image of
the proposed product need to be identical with the reference bitmap image from the clinically
validated product. When all test images are identical with the related reference bitmap
images then the test results meet the acceptance criteria and the conclusion is that the test
‘passed’.
Test execution: During the test execution, the same WSIs used to create the Reference Data
Set are imported in the proposed product. For this RegressionSingleTest a version of the IMS
HTML viewer is used that does not contain users controls but allows for retrieval of the pixel
data by a test framework.
K203845 - Page 6 of 7

--- Page 7 ---
IMS HTML viewer test method: The RegressionSingleTest executes the following steps for
each browser (i.e., Chrome):
1. Import 85 WSIs from the Reference Data Set in the proposed IMS.
2. For each of the 3377 selected regions:
• Open the region in the IMS HTML viewer,
• Read the displayed pixels from the User Interface (HTMLCanvasElement class)
into a test image,
• Load the pixels from the reference bitmap image,
• Compare the displayed pixels (RGB) of the test image with the pixels in the related
reference bitmap image for equivalence.
3. When all 3377 test images are identical with the reference bitmap images then report
‘passed’, otherwise report ‘fail’.
Test Results: All test results passed.
2. Testing of requirements, risk control measures, integration and regression
The verification testing activities performed, support the substantial equivalence determination
of the subject Philips Intellisite Pathology Solution (PIPS) (K203845) with the modified Image
Management System to the predicate Philips Intellisite Pathology Solution (PIPS) (K192259).
Cybersecurity
Security Threat analysis was performed for IMS version 4.1.1 and compared to previous version,
IMS 3.2.1. No additional security risks were identified.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
