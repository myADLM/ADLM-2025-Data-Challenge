IV. Device/System Characteristics
A. Device Description
A description of required equipment, software, reagents, vendors, and storage conditions is
provided, and is described in the instructions for use (ACT Genomics manual). ACT Genomics
assumes responsibility for the device. The assay system includes a sequencing instrument,
reagents (DNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing), software (operation of the
sequencing instrument and variant calling), and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the use
of the system. ACT Genomics takes the responsibilities in monitoring the instrument; reagents
and consumable materials which will be used in the assay process. The device is an NGS-based
tumor profiling assay, which sequences tumor specimens to detect mutations.
1. Sample Preparation:
The ACTOnco IVD assay (referred to as ACTOnco assay hereafter) requires genomic DNA
isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens. The tumor volume
and minimum tumor content needed to obtain sufficient DNA for testing to achieve the stated
performance are shown in Table 1 below. If the minimum tumor proportion is less than 50%, the
tissue should be macro-dissected to select as much viable tumor as possible and minimize the
amount of adjacent non-tumor tissue.

2. DNA Extraction:
The ACTOnco assay requires genomic DNA isolated from FFPE tissue. DNA is quantified and
concentrated if necessary. Genomic DNA is stored at –80°C until assay initiation. The amount of
DNA required to perform the assay is 80 ng, with at least 15% of DNA at a fragment length
longer than 500 base pairs. DNA proceeds directly to library preparation.
3. Library Preparation:
Sequence libraries are prepared by first amplifying the target region with the custom DNA
primers corresponding to all exons and selected introns of 440 target genes. The amplicons are
enzymatically treated to partially digest the primers and then ligated to the sequencing adaptor
oligonucleotide and one of the 96 oligonucleotide barcodes in the Kit. A second PCR reaction is
performed to amplify the barcoded library. Quality and quantity of the barcoded library is
checked. The sample should be a smear with an average fragment size peak at 125-300bp ≥ 50%;
and total amount ≥ 3ng to ensure subsequent template preparation. The DNA libraries for all
samples and controls will then be pooled for the template preparation reaction.
4. Template Preparation and Sequencing:
Clonal amplification of the DNA library is performed prior to sequencing. The automated
emulsion polymerase chain reaction is performed per protocol. Sequence templates are then be
loaded onto chip and sequencing is conducted.
5. Data Analysis:
a) Data Management: Sample tracking and archiving of run-associated metadata (barcode
number, run name, sample accession number, source (class)) is performed with the following
key functions: Tracking sample status through various stages of data analysis; tracking
iterations of analysis applied to a give sample; recording versions of databases and algorithms
used in analysis; archival of pipeline output files (BAM, VCF) and sequencing run statistics
(e.g., total output per chip, and mean depth of coverage).
b) Signal Processing, Base calling, Read Alignment, BAM Generation, and Coverage
Statistics: Signal Processing, Base Calling, Read Alignment, BAM Generation, and Coverage
statistics are performed by the software. In the sequencing process, the software converts the
flow signals to nucleotide bases. Each read is assigned to a barcode in barcode classification.
The software then trims barcode and adaptors, and other quality checks. Then, the variant

caller plugin of the software employs a mapping alignment program to align reads to the
human reference genome (hg19). Aligned reads are written to a Binary Alignment Map
(BAM) file. The BAM file is then used for further data analysis. The coverage analysis plugin
of the software computes mean depth of coverage, uniformity of base coverage, and percent
reads on target.
c) Read Alignment Quality check: Following the manufacturer’s recommendation, read
alignment is used to evaluate the sequencing reaction quality and the corresponding library's
quality when an accurate reference is available. Reads are aligned to the sequence of hg19.
Any discrepancy in alignment to hg19, whether biological (actual variant) or technical
(sequencing error) is listed as a mismatch. Alignment performance metrics are reported using
the Alignment Quality (AQ) score, which defines the accuracy of sequencing reads when
compared to a reference genome sequence. The aligned length of a read at a given accuracy
threshold is defined as the greatest position in the read at which the accuracy in the bases, up
to and including the position, meets the accuracy threshold. Accuracy is specified using the
Phred -10log10 transformation, where 17 represents an error rate of 2% (98% accuracy). The
AQ level will decrease in samples with more variations compared to the reference genome, for
example, tumor samples with many SNPs and SNVs. The software defaults at “AQ17 Total
Bases”. AQ17 is the manufacturer’s default setting which provides a long mean read length
with some misalignment allowed to accommodate the mismatch in the samples to be detected.
d) Sample QC check: At the sample level, there are three QC metrics. The first metric is the
mean depth for each sample, which ensures each sample is sequenced with enough reads. The
mean depth for each sample needs to be ≥ 500x. The second metric is the target base coverage
(uniformity). Sequence coverage ≥ 100x is required with at least 85% of target regions to meet
this coverage metric. The third metric is the sample contamination QC check. Samples are
checked for possible contamination through bioinformatic analysis of an SNP profile
algorithm to reduce the risk of false-positive calls that could occur as a result of an unexpected
contamination event.
e) Mutation calling – single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions (Indels):
The analysis pipeline identifies two classes of mutations: (1) SNVs and (2) indels.
i) Analysis of positive and negative controls: At the sample level, sequencing coverage of ≥
500X is required, and sequence coverage of ≥ 100x is required with at least 85% of target
regions.
ii) Filters on sample coverage: Sequencing coverage of ≥ 500X is required for tumor
samples.
iii) Filtering for high confidence mutations: Raw SNV and indel calls are subjected to a
series of filtering steps to ensure only high-confidence calls are reported. The filter is
based on 1) variant frequency that identifies as a possible somatic mutation; 2) a known
hotspot mutation; 3) technical characteristics such as total depth, variant read count, and
strand bias, 4) background signal observed in in-house normal samples, and 5) not a
common artefact.
The thresholds for hotspot variants are ≥ 2% variant frequency and for non-hotspot variants
are ≥ 5%. There must be no evidence of strand bias, as determined by a strand bias < 0.9. The
total depth which must be ≥ 35 with the variant read count which must be ≥ 5 for hotspot and

--- Page 5 ---
≥ 10 for non-hotspot to be considered as a variant. The variants that had ≥ 5% mutational
allele frequency in any in-house normal samples are removed. Using a machine learning
model trained from manually reviewed variants, majority of artefacts are removed, while
retaining variants at hotspots or on clinically significant genes for manual inspection.
The filtering scheme and threshold are shown in Figure 1 below. The threshold values for the
filtering criteria were established based on mutation analysis on replicates of normal FFPE
samples, and optimized to reject all false positive SNVs and almost all false positive indel
calls from the reference dataset.
Figure 1. Filtering schema and threshold
f) Mutation Annotation: Variants with functional effects of point mutations, frameshifts, in-
frame insertion or deletions, splice site, and splice region variants are retained. Common
polymorphisms from gnomAD, and in-house normal sample database are removed.
g) Tumor Purity Analysis: The tumor purity of the sequenced sample may be different from the
tumor proportion determined by the pathologists using the entire pathology slide if the sample
has been subjected to macrodissection. The tumor purity of the sequenced sample is
determined by the software, which considers sequencing reads information, allele frequency of
single nucleotide polymorphisms, and possible genomic typing. Manual inspection is

--- Page 6 ---
performed to determine tumor purity by considering pathologist-determined tumor proportion
and driver mutation mutational allele frequency in cases when a limitation in the software is
identified.
h) Copy Number Analysis: Copy number analysis determines the amplification status of the
ERBB2 gene by measuring the read coverage of a large segment of the ERBB2 gene relative
to the rest of the sequenced region using the software. It includes two steps: (1) Read coverage
data is compared to data from a pooled normal baseline and normalized to arrive at a
normalized coverage ratio. (2) The observed copy number is determined by assigning the ratio
value for the situation when copy number is two, and then determining the copy number based
on the ratio at ERBB2 gene. ERBB2 gene is reported as amplification if the observed copy
number is ≥ 4.
i) Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB): TMB is calculated based on detected sequence
mutations. Filtering of sequence mutations is performed to exclude low mutant allele fraction
mutations (<5% MAF), common somatic driver mutations, and common germline mutations.
Both synonymous and non-synonymous alterations are considered for the mutation load. TMB
is reported as the number of mutations per megabase (Muts/Mb).
6. Controls:
a) Positive control: The positive control sample (commercial vendor qualified by ACT
Genomics) contains different confirmed mutations, representing a range of mutation allele
frequencies. Data generated from the positive control sample is analyzed using the pipeline,
and frequencies of the detected mutations are reviewed to determine if (1) the known
mutations are among those called, and (2) the observed frequencies for the known mutations
match their expected values within a tolerance interval covering 99.9% proportion with 95%
confidence. The positive control with expected mutational variant frequency (MAF) are shown
in Table 2.

b) Negative control: The negative control sample uses peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) from healthy population which are lacking any clinically relevant genetic alterations
in target areas. The assay will interrogate 755 hotspot locations and the expected outcome
should be negative for a mutational call, that is, result in a wild-type call or no mutation found.
c) No Template Control: DNAse, RNAse free distilled water will be used as the no template
control sample, and will be included into library preparation to verify that there is no
contamination of reagents. The library product of the no template control sample is analyzed
by capillary electrophoresis (Fragmented Analyzer) before samples proceed to sequencing.
The no template control should have no detectable major peak at 125-300bp and an
undetectable concentration.
7. Result Reporting:
 ACTOnco results are reported out under one of the two categories: “Cancer Mutations with
Evidence of Clinical Significance” or “Cancer Mutations with Potential Clinical
Significance”. The two categories are based on the supporting level of clinical evidence.
 Results are reported for point mutations and small insertions and deletions of the 440 gene
panel. Refer to Appendix A for a list of genes.
 The ACTOnco does not report mutations in 650 regions among 18431 interrogated target
regions (528 regions due to consistently low coverage in 187 genes and 124 regions due to
pseudogene in 24 genes). Refer to Appendix B for a list of excluded exons.
 ERBB2 gene is reported as amplification if the observed copy number is ≥ 4.
 TMB reporting: TMB is measured by counting the total number of mutations detected in the
consensus coding region (1.12Mb) interrogated by ACTOnco assay. TMB is measured as
mutations per megabase (mut/Mb), reported as a number.
 Reporting takes in account the quality metrics listed in the Table 3 below.
8. Quality Metrics:
Quality metrics are assessed across the following categories:
 Run (Batch) level: Metrics that are quantified per sequencing run. If the run (batch)-level
metrics failed, all the samples in that run will need to be re-sequenced.
 Sample level: Metrics that are quantified per sample. If the sample-level QC failed, the sample
will be flagged for inspection or rework of the library or re-sequenced.
 Variant (analyte) level: Metrics that are quantified for individual alteration types and
positions, such as sequence coverage. Variants passing analyte-level QC are reported.

B. Test Principle
The ACTOnco assay is a custom targeted sequencing platform, utilizing amplicon-based
sequencing, to detect point mutations (single nucleotide variants, or SNVs), small insertions and
deletions (Indels), ERBB2 gene amplification, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in tumor
specimens. The ACTOnco assay involves target amplification and deep sequencing of all coding
exons of 440 genes. The assay uses custom DNA primers corresponding to all exons and selected
introns of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, drug metabolism genes, and immune-related
genes. An overlapping amplicon approach is utilized in which tiled primers are designed to
generate multiple overlapping amplicons of the same region to avoid allele dropout. In total, the
primers target approximately 1.8Mb of the human genome. Genomic DNA is extracted from
FFPE tissue samples.
Sequence libraries are prepared through a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification step to enrich target sequences. Target sequences are tagged with index
oligonucleotide to identify individual sample and adaptor oligonucleotide to anchor the amplicon
to complimentary oligonucleotides embedded on the surface of the sequencing bead. Target
sequences on the sequencing beads are amplified using emulsion PCR before sequencing.
Multiple barcoded sequence libraries are pooled and then sequenced; sequence reads are then
aligned to the reference human genome. By comparing the identity of bases from the tumor DNA
and the reference human genome, variant alterations are identified in the tumor.
C. Determination of assay thresholds
1. Requirements on exon coverage:
A power analysis was conducted to estimate the depth or the total number of reads needed to
detect a mutation with a true underlying mutation allele frequency (MAF) of 2% or greater, for

varying levels of power (0.8 to 0.99), assuming a fixed alpha (Type I error rate) of 0.05. The 95%
confidence interval (CI) ranges of observed MAF as a function of sequencing depth were also
calculated. The study showed that when a mutation is present at 10%, the 95% CI with a
sequencing depth of 500X is expected to fall between 7.5% and 13%. When the overall coverage
is 100X, the 95% CI for a mutation at 10% is estimated to fall between 5.0% and 17.6%.
To confirm these estimates, empirical data was obtained to measure the range of observed MAF
for expected MAF using DNA from 20 normal tissue FFPE samples of unrelated individuals
mixed in equimolar parts to create a range of SNPs with expected frequencies as low as 2.5%. A
total of 890 common SNPs were considered for this experiment.
A boxplot in Figure 2 shows the observed mutation frequencies for the 890 common SNPs
genotyped in the pooled DNA sample binned by their true underlying mutation frequency. The
empirical data showed a consistent correlation between expected and observed MAF (Pearson’s r
= 0.99) with a slope of 0.99 and an intercept of 0.001. The results demonstrated that an observed
VF range from 8.3% to 15.6% for an SNP with a true underlying mutation frequency of 10%
when the mean depth of the sample was 1056X. This range in values is roughly in line with what
the theoretical statistical assessment for a depth of 500X (7.5% to 13.0%). This data provided
support for using 5% as the lower limit for reporting mutations detected with a true underlying
frequency of 10%. Furthermore, for the variant with an expected MAF equal to 5%, the lower
bound of observed variant frequency is 2%, suggesting that an observed MAF of 2% can be used
to detect actual 5% variants.
Figure 2. Observed vs Expected Variant Frequency
2. Requirements on sample coverage:

--- Page 10 ---
Eighteen normal FFPE samples were profiled using ACTOnco to generate summary statistics
across all target exons. The mean coverage across all amplicons was 1102X (640X-1445X,
SD=230X). The percentage of >100X amplicon coverage was 92% (90-93%, SD=0.8%). When
the amplicons were mapped to the exon level, the mean coverage across all targeted exons was
1121X (647X-1472X, SD=232X). Summary statistics were also computed based on coverage
values per exon normalized by per-sample coverage. There were exons that presented with
consistently low coverage values. None of the exons of the genes in clinical validation are among
those with consistently low coverage. It was determined the low coverage was due to sequence
similarity with other loci, poor amplification efficiency, and high GC content. The exons with
consistently low coverage were removed from the ACTOnco assay.
Sequence coverage was further evaluated to establish minimum criteria for the analysis and
reporting of variants. A 100X minimum coverage threshold per exon is required based on the
power calculation, which showed 100X coverage was necessary to call mutations with true
underlying mutation frequency of 10% or greater, with 95% power at an alpha level of 0.05. Of
the remaining exons across all genes, 99.1% (97.7-99.7%, SD=0.5%) were sequenced to a depth
of 100X or greater. The distribution of the mean coverage value and median coverage value for
the targeted exon were shown in the below Figure 3.
Figure 3. Distribution of mean and median coverage values for targeted regions of
ACTOnco test using 18 samples with higher coverage. Dashed line indicates 100X coverage.
A second set of 20 samples with lower sequencing depth was evaluated using the same analysis.
The mean coverage across all amplicons was 572X (471X-637X, SD=46X). The percentage of
>100X amplicon coverage was 91.1% (87.9-92.7%, SD=1.1%). When the amplicons were
mapped to the exon level, the mean coverage across all targeted exons was 616X (495X-695X,
SD=54X). With the same remaining exons across all genes, 97.8%% (97.1-98.9%, SD=0.5%)
were sequenced to a depth of 100X or greater. The distribution of the mean coverage value and
median coverage value for the targeted exon were shown in the below Figure 4.

--- Page 11 ---
Figure 4. Distribution of mean and median coverage values for targeted regions of
ACTOnco test using 20 samples with lower coverage. Dashed line indicates 100X coverage.
Based on the two studies above, the threshold of a minimum of 85% of amplicon must have 100X
was established for the ACTOnco test.
3. Requirements on mutation coverage, allele depth and frequency for positive calls:
Variant calling parameters such as sequence coverage (allele depth, AO), variant coverage
(variant read, DP) and strand bias (SB) were assessed as filters for specificity while maintaining
the ability to detect true positive calls. Thresholds were established to ensure specificity is
maintained at targeted MAF levels for reporting. Mutation thresholds were established at 2% and
5% for sequence mutations based on a categorization with somatic hotspots and non-hotspots
positions.
The cutoffs for AO, DP, and SB for hotspot variants and non-hotspot variants were established
using two development studies. The first study was designed to select the best parameter cutoff
combination using a dataset of 17 ACTOnco run using a Reference Standard. Three parameters
each were evaluated with multiple cutoffs to generate a total of 6888 combinations. A list of 3844
positive variants and 9146 negative variants was used to evaluate the performance of each
parameter combination. The cutoff combination which generates the best positive predictive
value was selected. The second study aimed to determine the cutoff for variant read count. The
study used 18 non-cancer FFPE samples and evaluate a total of 858 hotspot variants and 2359
non-hotspot variants at different variant read cutoffs. The lowest read count which can filter out
>99.5% of noise variants (5 for hotspot variants, 10 reads for non-hotspot variants) was selected
as the cutoff.

F. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance- General
The ACTOnco assay is a targeted NGS panel with 440 genes. The targeted regions of interest in
ACTOnco are designed to detect SNVs, deletions up to 19bp and insertions up to 12bp in length
of the targeted genes, as well as ERBB2 amplifications, and TMB. For SNVs and indels, a
representative approach to validation of the targeted genes in the panel was submitted with data
representing variant types for SNVs and indels, and at the gene level for amplification indicated

with this assay. In addition, the assay was evaluated for performance regarding the panel wide
quality metrics.
a) Invalid Rates
The invalid rates across multiple tumor types obtained from historical data was evaluated with
1526 FFPE clinical specimens tested with the ACTOnco assay. The data shows the separate
invalid rates for the different steps involved in the assay workflow including the percentage of
specimens with insufficient tumor, DNA integrity and yield, the percentage with failed library
prep and the percentage that failed the sequencing run per cancer type (Table 6). The overall
(Pre and Post-run) invalid rates ranged from 0% to 26% principally due to insufficient tumor
and insufficient DNA yield related to the specimen source. The data shows that the DNA
extraction is valid across tumor types and interference effects from different specimens are not
significant across different tumor types supporting the performance of the pan-tumor specimen
handling.

2. Precision
a) Precision Panel
The within lab precision (between-run and within-run) of the ACTOnco assay was assessed
using 20 FFPE clinical samples (12 single samples across 10 tumor types and 8 mixed samples
across 4 tumor types) to represent different tumor types, different variants, and the range of
frequencies. Extracted DNA from each of the 20 samples was tested in duplicate by 2 different
operators on 2 instruments across 2 non- consecutive start days using 3 kit lots, yielding 48
replicates per sample. For each replicate tested, all observed mutations which passed the
ACTOnco assay QC metrics were reported and assessed for precision. The single samples or
mixed samples with known mutations corresponding to FDA level 2 variants (mutations with
evidence of clinical significance) and level 3 variants (mutation with evidence of potential
clinical significance) are shown in Table 7 and Table 8, respectively. Among the 12 single
samples, one sample does not contain any variants with FDA level 2 or level 3 and is not listed
in Table 7.

b) Panel-wide precision for SNVs and Indels
The precision was assessed for all detected mutations across 48 replicates for each sample. The
positive and negative call rates were calculated based on the total number of mutations along
with the two-sided 95% CI. Table 9 summarizes the positive and negative call rates rolled up
(mutational variant type, operator, instrument, reagent lot, and days). The overall positive call
rate was 98.3% across all samples and replicates (35,308/ 35,906, 98.2%-98.5% CI). The

* Correct calls may be positive (mutation present) or negative (wild type present). A correct call
was defined as the same mutational variant call with each of the observations of a sample with
that variant.
In addition to the mutations with FDA level (as listed in Table 7 and Table 8), other mutations
identified in each specimen in any of the test replicates were evaluated (n = 751) with 48
replicates each. Amongst the 751 mutations, 662 mutations had 100% correct calls, 37/751
mutations had ≥ 90% correct calls, 32/751 mutations had ≥ 50% correct calls, and only 5/751
mutations had < 50% correct calls. Note the ≤ 50% correct calls were for variants where the
mean MAF was at their respective cutoff (2 or 5%). There were 15/751 mutations with 100%
correct call but the total observations were not 48 due to loss of observations due to assay QC.
The coefficient of variance (CV) for the MAF was also calculated for all replicates. Two
hundred and eighty-three (283) of the 386 (73%) mutations in the single samples had a percent
CV ≤ 10%, 88 of 386 (23%) were between 10 and 20%, and 15 of 386 (4%) were > 20%. In the
mixed samples, 133/365 (37%) had a percent CV ≤ 10%, 195/365 (53%) were between 10 and
20%, and 37/365 (10%) were > 20%.
Positive call rates for known mutations with FDA level 2 or level 3 listed in Table 7 and Table
8 are summarized in Table 10 and Table 11, respectively.

* NC Range = Normalized coverage range
c) Per-Specimen Precision for SNVs and Indels
Precision was calculated for each individual specimen as shown in Table 12 (single samples)
and Table 13 (mixed samples). Results from the precision studies were combined across all
reportable genes for each specimen. The positive and negative call rates for sequence mutations
(SNVs, MNVs, insertions and deletions) in each sample were calculated based on the total
number of mutations along with the two-sided 95% CI.

d) Precision for ERBB2 amplification
Precision of ERBB2 amplification was evaluated across the same set of 20 samples (12 single
and 8 mixed). Each sample was tested in duplicate by 2 different operators on 2 instruments
across 2 non- consecutive start days using 3 kit lots, yielding 48 replicates per sample. Within
the 20 samples, 3 samples contained ERBB2 amplification and the rest of the samples contained
no ERBB2 amplification. The assay reports ERBB2 amplification when the observed copy
number for the gene is greater than or equal to 4 copies of the observed copy number
determined by the assay. The mean observed copy number (CNV), observed copy number
range, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (%CV), positive call rate along with
95% CI for each sample with ERBB2 amplification are summarized in Table 14. The call rates
were 100% for both amplification and no amplification groups.

e) Precision for TMB
Precision of TMB was evaluated across 12 single samples with TMB scores ranging from 0.7 to
45.8. Specimens spanned the range of TMB scores and included 10 different tumor types. The
tumor purity for these samples ranged from 32.5% to 72.7%. The mean TMB score, SD, %CV
and mean target region coverage for each sample are shown in Table 15. The calculated %CV
for samples with TMB scores >5 are less than 10% except sample 9, which contains the highest
percentage of SNVs with low MAF (<10%) in the whole sample sets. Overall, the data supports
a repeatable TMB reporting by the ACTOnco assay.

3. Analytical Sensitivity - Limit of Detection (LoD):
The LoD of the ACTOnco assay for SNVs and indels is defined as the MAF at which 95% of
replicates for a variant type are reliably detected. The LoDs of the ACTOnco assay for ERBB2
amplification and TMB is determined as the minimum tumor purity required for robust
reporting of amplification status and TMB scores, respectively. The recommended DNA input
for the ACTOnco assay is 80 ng of total DNA, with a minimum tumor purity of 30% for TMB
reporting.
a) LoD – SNVs and Indels:
The LoD of the ACTOnco assay for SNVs and indels was evaluated by assessing 10 clinical
FFPE specimens from 8 different cancer types with 15 SNVs, 5 insertions and 11 deletions.
Each sample was diluted to 5 dilution levels and tested in 5 replicates per level using two
reagent lots. The call rate was determined for each variant and the LoD/C95 was approximated
between the call rate that was below 95% and the highest call rate (100%). Table 16 is a
summary of the estimation of the LoD range for each variant along with the cutoff within the
entire panel evaluated in the study. The established MAF range for each variant type (Hotspot
SNVs, Non-hotspot SNVs, insertions and deletion) is shown in Table 17.

b) LoD - Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB)
The minimum tumor purity requirement for input into the ACTOnco assay is 30%. The
minimum tumor purity required for robust reporting of TMB scores by ACTOnco assay was
confirmed using 5 clinical FFPE specimens with TMB score ≥10 from the LoD study. DNA
extracted from each sample was serially diluted to 5 levels with matched normal DNA and
tested in 5 replicates per level per reagent lot (2 lots were used), resulting in 10 observations per
level. The cancer types, tumor purity, mean TMB score, SD, %CV and average mean exon
coverage of all valid replicates are shown below in Table 18.
Figure 5. further visualizes the TMB scores with respective tumor purities. This data
demonstrates a robust reporting of TMB scores by the ACTOnco assay across tumor purities at
or above 20% with %CV < 16%, supporting the minimum tumor purity requirement of 30%. In
addition, data obtained from the DNA input and precision study also demonstrate a robust
reporting of TMB scores by the ACTOnco assay when testing specimens with tumor purity
close to 30%.

Analytical sensitivity of ERBB2 was assessed by testing 1 clinical breast cancer sample diluted
with normal FFPE DNA to 5 detection levels (variants at low tumor purity). Each dilution level
was run in 5 replicates per reagent lot (2 lots were used), resulting in a total of 10 replicates per
level per sample. The cutoff for ERBB2 detection is an observed copy number ≥ 4. The data
summarized in Table 19 showed 100% call rates for samples with tumor purity over 10% and
two lots of reagents yielded similar results. These findings were further supported by data
obtained from the DNA input study, in which 2 FFPE clinical specimen with low tumor purity
and ERBB2 copy numbers near the cutoff were evaluated in 5 replicates (Table 24 under DNA
input study for ERBB2).

5. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or methods)
The ACTOnco IVD assay is not traceable to any known standard. Controls and quality metrics
are described in the device description section.
6. Stability:
Reagent stability is based on manufacturer expiration dating, and supported by ACT Genomics
verification. Stability of the reagents is monitored through the use of consistent controls.
7. Expected values (controls):
The positive control sample (commercial vendor qualified by ACT Genomics) contains
different confirmed mutations, representing a range of mutation allele frequencies. The positive
control is processed from library preparation through sequencing to serve as an end to end
control to demonstrate assay performance. It is checked for quality during library preparation
and after sequencing. Failure of the control to meet the pre-defined quality metrics will result in
all test samples on the run be flagged and re-sequenced.

8. Analytical Specificity:
a) Interfering Substance
To evaluate the potential impact of endogenous and exogenous interfering substances on the
performance of the ACTOnco assay, 6 clinical FFPE samples were tested in 4 replicates in the
presence and absence of each interfering substance (hemoglobin at 4mg/mL, melanin at
1ng/µL, and wash buffer at 5%). Analysis of all variant types tested (SNVs/indels, ERBB2 copy
number alterations and TMB) showed no effect of exogenous interferent for all conditions
(Table 20-21 and Figure 6-8). The results showed minimal risk to assay performance from
interfering substances.

Necrotic Tissue
The impact of necrosis on the performance of ACTOnco assay was evaluated by assessing the
DNA yield and DNA quality metrics across 469 FFPE samples in the accuracy study.
Concordance for all variant types between the test group (necrotic tissue ranged:10 – 50%) and
the control group (necrotic tissue < 10%) were also evaluated. The data indicated there is no
correlation between necrosis and DNA yield/quality, nor between necrosis and variant
reporting.
b) Sample Cross-Contamination
Cross-contamination of DNA samples during the library preparation (contamination from one
sample to another within the same sequencing run) was assessed using the positive and negative
process control samples for the ACTOnco assay. The study was performed in a designated
checkerboard pattern of 12 positive control samples alternating with 12 negative control
samples within 96-well plate. All library construction batch and sequencing runs were
completed without QC failure or deviation. No positive variants were detected in the negative
control samples, and all 15 known positive variants were detected in each positive control
sample. Therefore, no cross-contamination was observed.

9. Robustness Studies
a) DNA Input
The recommended amount of input DNA for the ACTOnco assay is 80 ng. A DNA Input study
was performed to demonstrate the analytical performance of the ACTOnco assay across a range
of DNA input (20, 40, 80 ng) using 10 FFPE clinical specimens representative of 8 cancer
types. Each sample was tested in 5 replicates at each DNA input level to report SNVs, indels,
ERBB2 copy number amplification, and TMBs. The QC metrics and variant reporting for each
sample was evaluated per DNA input level. All of the sample level QC metrics passed for all
input levels. The variant level QC results indicate that the 80 ng input allows for less of a
chance that the variant read count (VRC) will fail as the variant MAF approaches its assay
cutoff, possibly due to more template in the assay (Table 22).

DNA Input – SNVs and Indels:
The variant calls (positive and negative) for the 10 samples at the DNA input of 20, 40, and 80
ng were evaluated by determining the correct calls. The call rates for the positive variants at the
DNA input level of 20 ng, 40 ng, and 80 ng were 97.6% (1315/1347), 97.5% (1309/1342), and
97.2% (1305/1342), respectively (Table 23). The call rates for the negative variants (WT) at
each DNA input level were all 100.0% across 3 DNA input levels (data not shown). This data
indicates that the amount of DNA added to the assay behaves the same across all DNA input
levels tested with respect to the observed call rates but that 80ng DNA input would be better for
variants that are near their respective cutoffs (data not shown).

DNA Input – ERBB2:
The DNA input for ERBB2 reporting was evaluated with 2 FFPE tumor specimen with ERBB2
amplification near the cutoff at low tumor purity in 5 replicates. The results shown in Table 24
below support the reporting of ERBB2 amplification by the ACTOnco assay across 3 DNA
input levels tested for samples with low tumor purity of 30%.

DNA input for TMB
Among the 10 samples assessed for TMB analyses across 3 DNA input levels (20, 40, and 80
ng), 7 of them were selected at low tumor purity (15% – 30%) to assess the repeatability of
ACTOnco assay for TMB reporting with minimum tumor content. Performance of TMB at the
recommended tumor purity (> 30%) was found to be consistent across all DNA input levels,
regardless of TMB scores (Table 25). This data indicates that the DNA input of 80ng is
recommended for the ACTOnco assay.

10. Method Comparison (Accuracy)
The analytical accuracy of the ACTOnco assay as a tumor profiling device was evaluated using
clinical FFPE samples, obtained from patients with a variety of tumor types. Data was
aggregated at the variant level for SNVs, MNVS, insertions and deletions, gene level for
ERBB2 gene amplification and sample/ case level for TMB. The PPA and NPA were calculated
by comparing the concordance between the ACTOnco Assay and the appropriate comparator.
a) Accuracy – SNVs and Indels
The accuracy of the ACTOnco assay was assessed by comparing ACTOnco results to results
obtained from an externally validated NGS assay (referred to as Ev-NGS assay hereafter). A
total of 438 FFPE tumor samples from clinical cases spanning 21 cancer types were assessed in
this analysis, representing mutations covering 1034 SNVs, 12 MNVs, 43 insertions and 86
deletions over 106 genes. The Ev-NGS assay detected 1254 mutational variants, of these,
ACTOnco assay detected 1227, resulting in a PPA of 97.85% (95% CI: 96.89% to 98.52%).
Within the same sample set, the Ev-NGS assay reported 457,446 wild type. Of these, 457,319
were also reported as wild type by the ACTOnco assay, resulting in an NPA of 99.97 (95% CI:
99.97% to 99.98%). This data is summarized in Table 26 and Table 27 below.

b) Accuracy – Concordance to DISH for ERBB2 amplification
In total 129 FFPE samples representing 21 different cancer types were evaluated for ERBB2
gene amplification between the ACTOnco assay and HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail test
(DISH). Of these, 3 samples were tested with DNA input levels lower than 80ng and therefore
were not included in the analysis, resulting a total data set of 126 samples. The concordance
between the ACTOnco assay and DISH was calculated (Table 31). The DISH assay detected
ERRBB2 gene amplification in 45 samples, of which the ACTOnco assay detected 42, resulting
in a PPA of 93.33% (95% CI: 82.14% and 97.71%). For the remaining 81 samples that were
negative by DISH, all 81 were negative by ACTOnco, resulting in a NPA of 100.00% (95% CI:
95.47% and 100.00%) as shown in Table 32. According to the labeling for DISH, if the DISH
ratio falls between 1.8 to 2.2, a new ratio should be formed with an additional 20 nuclei for the
ERBB2 status determination. Of the 126 samples tested by DISH assay, 3 samples were within
the DISH ratio 1.8-2.2. Also, of the 126 samples tested by DISH assay, 30 samples were within
the DISH ratio 1.5-2.5, which is close to the cutoff of 2. Therefore, additional analysis of PPA
and NPA for cases excluding DISH borderline cases (1.8-2.2), cases only with DISH scores 1.8-
2.2, and cases only with DISH scores 1.5-2.5 separately is provided in Table 32. The data
shows a NPA of 100% for all categories, while PPA of cases excluding DISH 1.8-2.2 is 95.45%
and PPA of cases excluding DISH 1.5-2.5 is 95.24%. Of the 3 samples that yielded discordant
results (negative by ACTOnco but positive by DISH), 1 sample was within DISH ratio of 1.8-
2.2.

c) Accuracy – TMB
The ACTOnco assay reports a TMB score using the sequenced regions of interest to estimate
the number of somatic synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations per megabase of all protein-
coding genes. The ability of ACTOnco assay to accurately identify TMB in multiple solid tissue
FFPE tumor types was assessed by comparing TMB rates generated by ACTOnco assay to
whole exome sequencing (WES) results. Across 14 cancer types (breast, colon adenocarcinoma,
endo gland, endometrial, kidney, liver, lung, oral cavity, ovarian, prostate, skin, stomach,
pancreas, and urinary), 45 FFPE clinical cases were enrolled covering a dynamic range of 0.1-
63.2 Muts/Mb. In total, 560 mutations were detected by the ACTOnco and 554 were detected
by WES in the overlapping regions. Of these, 426 variants were detected by both ACTOnco and
WES, suggesting that the estimated TMB would be overlapping the same variants. The TMB
scores calculated from WES and ACTOnco were plotted and a model was fit to the data as
shown in Figure 9. Based on a regression analysis, the estimated slope and intercept are 0.921
(0.781, 1.061) and 1.047 (0.046, 1.649), respectively (Table 33). In addition, the Spearman rank
coefficient was calculated to determine if the rank ordering of TMB values would be changed
between ACTOnco and WES within the data sets evaluated. Assessment of all 45 cases resulted
in a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.885.
