IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The device is provided as a kit that comprises a single YD Diagnostics URiSCAN 2 ACR Urine
strips (YD Diagnostics Corporation, k141874), 1 single-use Color-Boards, and a User Manual. The
Minuteful – kidney test also consists of a smartphone application for use on the home users’
smartphone, and an image recognition algorithm running on a back-end, cloud-based server.
ACR results are reported to both the home user and the prescribing physician.
The individual albumin and creatinine results are reported only to the prescribing physician.
B Principle of Operation:
The albumin test is based on sulfonephthalein dye binding to albumin at a constant pH. The
development of pale green to aqua blue indicates the presence of albumin. The creatinine test is
based on the peroxidase-like activity of a copper creatinine complex that catalyzes the reaction of
diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide and 3,3’,5,5’- tetramethylbenzidine. The resulting color
ranges from orange through green to blue.
The Minuteful – kidney test scans and analyzes the test strip using a mobile device running the
smartphone application.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Minuteful - kidney test
2. Specimen Identification:
The Minuteful kidney-test application will instruct the user to enter their patient
identification information in the application.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The test is performed using midstream urine sample collected in a cup.
4. Calibration:
Calibration is not needed.
5. Quality Control:
The device has internal controls and no external quality controls are provided.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Testing was conducted with 3 urine samples. Each urine sample was produced by spiking
negative urine with albumin and creatinine to the following expected reporting levels: 10
mg/L, 30-80 mg/L, and 150 mg/L albumin; 10 mg/dL, 50 mg/dL, and 200-300 mg/dL
creatinine; Normal, Abnormal, and High-Abnormal ACR. Testing was conducted by 3
operators over 3 days at 3 sites using 3 device lots per site. Each device lot was used to test
each of the 3 urine samples in 2 runs per day with 3 replicates per run. All testing was
conducted with 1 iPhone 11 and 1 Pixel 3a per site. Repeatability was calculated using the
results from all of the replicates from the first run of the first day. Reproducibility was
calculated using all replicates across the entire study.

80 mg/L, and 150 mg/L), creatinine (expected values 10 mg/dL, 50 mg/dL, 200-300 mg/dL),
and ACR (Normal, Abnormal, and High-Abnormal) were tested by 3 operators in singlicate
at 3 sites with 2 runs per day using 3 device lots with 1 iPhone and 1 Pixel 3a per site. The
results were similar to the results in the studies described above.
2. Linearity:
Testing was conducted with urine samples spiked to 4 levels of creatinine (expected outputs
of 10, 50, 100, and 200-300 mg/dL), 3 levels of albumin (expected outputs of 10, 30-80, and
150 mg/L), and 3 levels of ACR (expected outputs of Normal, Abnormal, and High-
Abnormal). The study was performed by three (3) different operators, using three (3)
different strip lots with ten (10) replicates per lot. The study was conducted using iPhone 11
and Pixel 3a devices.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference testing was conducted per recommendations in CLSI EP07 Interference Testing
in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Third Edition. Negative urine was spiked with
3 levels of albumin (expected outputs of 10, 30-80, and 150 mg/L) and creatinine (expected
outputs of 10, 50, and 200-300 mg/dL) to produce test samples with 3 levels of ACR
(expected outputs of Normal, Abnormal, and High-Abnormal). Test samples were spiked
with interfering substance or the same volume of diluent (control samples). The
concentrations of interfering substances tested were higher than the concentrations of these
substances expected to be in urine samples from the intended use population. Testing was
conducted with 1 device lot on the Apple iPhone 11 and Google Pixel 3a and 10 replicates

were tested at each test level with each potentially interfering substance. The results of the
test samples with interfering substance were compared to the results of the control samples
and no interference was defined as 100% agreement (10/10) between the sample with
potential interferent and control samples. If interference was observed, additional testing was
conducted to determine the lowest concentration of the interfering substance that shows
interference and the highest that does not show interference.

To inform the lay user about potential interference, the User Manual contains the statements,
“Do not use the device in the case of a discolored urine specimen. If the color of your urine is
different than yellow or clear, do not use this test and consult with your healthcare
professional” and “The substances that have been shown to interfere include: Ascorbic acid
(Vitamin C), mesna (MESNEX), sodium bicarbonate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate
(PLAQUENIL®). If you are taking these medications or supplements, please inform your
physician.”
Specific Gravity (SG)
The test urine samples were adjusted to specific gravities of 1.000, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015,
1.025, 1.035, and 1.045. No interference on albumin, creatinine or ACR was observed at the
urine specific gravities tested.
pH
The test urine samples were adjusted to pH levels of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. No interference on
albumin, creatinine or ACR was observed at the urine pH levels tested.
4. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The sponsor’s device is traceable to a legally marketed urine ACR device. The sponsor’s
traceability scheme was reviewed and found acceptable.
5. Detection Limit/Cutoffs:
The sponsor collected a total of 57 urine samples from subjects with Diabetes Mellitus Type
II, Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, Cardiovascular disease, a known kidney disease (e.g.,
Nephrolithiasis, Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract, Diabetic
nephropathy), Malignancy (e.g., Renal cell carcinoma), Autoimmune disease and Tobacco
use disorder. The median age of this population was 62. The samples were pooled and
diluted with negative urine to produce different levels of albumin and creatinine.
Albumin and creatinine were measured in test samples using a commercially available device
that quantitatively measures albumin and creatinine in urine.

The sponsor conducted testing with 1 lot of their device. Several samples with albumin and
creatinine levels around the cutoffs were tested and the sponsor used a Probit model
described in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline to estimate the C5, C50 and C95 for each of the
cutoffs. Testing was conducted with 16 representative smartphones.
The sponsor’s study supports that the cutoffs between the albumin and creatinine categories
are the same when the test is used with different smartphones and operating systems.

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A total of 466 subjects (263 males and 203 females) 18 to 81 years of age were enrolled to
assess the performance of the sponsor’s device. Study subjects were lay users and included
those with hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease and kidney
disease. Subjects tested their own urine samples with the sponsor’s device using an iPhone
11 or Google Pixel 3a following the user manual and in-application prompts. The subjects’
urine samples were then tested by a trained operator using the predicate device. The trained
operator was blinded to the results from the sponsor’s device. The results from the sponsor’s
device were compared with the results from the predicate device. The results are summarized
in the tables below.

Ratio
Albuminuria categories are based on ACR (mg albumin per gram of creatinine in a spot urine
sample). Categories are based on recommendations in Kidney Disease: Improving Global
Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD Work Group. KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the
Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease. Kidney inter., Suppl. 2013; 3: 1– 150.
F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
The sponsor conducted flex studies with urine samples spiked with albumin and creatinine to
three levels of albumin, creatinine, and ACR. The expected results for the three levels of urine
samples tested were 10 mg/L, 30-80 mg/L, and 150 mg/L for albumin; 10 mg/dL, 50 mg/dL, and
200-300 mg/dL for creatinine; Normal, Abnormal, and High-abnormal for ACR.
1. Timing
a) Dipping Time
Strips were dipped in the test urine samples for two different time durations, 1 second
(the control dipping time) and 10 seconds. Wetting (“blotting”) and assay times (time
between blotting and scanning) were <1 second and 75 seconds, respectively. Testing
was conducted with two representative smartphones of different models and operating
systems (iPhone 11 and Pixel 3a). The results support that dipping for up to 10 seconds
does not impact test performance. The Minuteful kidney – test application guides the user
through each step of the testing procedure and instructs the user to dip the strip for 1
second.

b) Blotting Time
Strips were dipped in the test urine samples for 1 second and either blotted for <1 second
(control) or blotted for 75 seconds (test). Testing was conducted with two representative
smartphones of different models and operating systems (iPhone 11 and Pixel 3a). The
results support that blotting times for up to 75 seconds do not impact test performance.
The Minuteful kidney – test application guides the user through each step of the testing
procedure and instructs the user to blot the strip for 1 second.
c) Assay Time
Strips were dipped in the test urine samples for 1 second and blotted for <1 second. The
assay time (time between blotting and scanning the strip with the smart phone) were 75
seconds (the control assay time) and 180 seconds (test assay time). Testing was
conducted with two representative smartphones of different models and operating
systems (iPhone 11 and Pixel 3a). The results support that assay times for up to 180
seconds do not significantly impact test performance. The Minuteful kidney – test
application guides the user through each step of the testing procedure and instructs the
user to take a picture of the test strip and Color-Board within 3 minutes (180 seconds) of
blotting the test strip. If the assay time exceeds 180 seconds, the application prevents the
user from completing the test.
2. Carry-Over
Strips were held in both the "up" (with albumin on top) and "down" (with creatinine on top)
positions for 0 (control), 10, 25 and 40 seconds after being dipped in solutions and before
blotting. In the "up" experiment, a solution comprised of 150 mg/L albumin and 10 mg/dL
creatinine, was used. In the "down" experiment, a solution comprised of 200-300 mg/dL
creatinine and 10 mg/L albumin, was used. Dipping and assay times were 1 and 75 seconds,
respectively. The wetting (“blotting) time corresponded to the time the strip will be held in
the “up” or “down” position (nested factors). Testing was conducted with two representative
smartphones of different models and operating systems (iPhone 11 and Pixel 3a). The results
support that the performance is not impacted by potential carry-over from one reagent pad to
the other. The Minuteful kidney – test application guides the user through each step of the
testing procedure and instructs the user to blot the test strip immediately after dipping and
place it on the Color-Board.
3. Illumination
a) Testing was conducted under different lighting conditions of different color
“temperatures” and intensities from different light sources representative of those that
may be used in the home setting. Testing was conducted with 16 representative smart
phones of different models using different operating systems. The results of the study
support that the performance is not impacted by lighting conditions that are likely to be
found in the home use environment.
b) Testing was conducted under different lighting conditions with different saturation of red,
green, and blue light. Testing was conducted with 16 representative phones of different
models and operating systems. Phones were tested under “boundary conditions” that were
K210069 - Page 15 of 17

--- Page 16 ---
the maximum saturation of red, green, or blue light under which the device allowed the
phone to take a picture of the urine test strip and color-board (under red, green, or blue
light saturation that exceeded the boundary conditions, the application blocks the user
from taking a picture). The results of this testing support that the device performance is
not impacted by different light color saturation.
c) Testing was conducted under different light intensities (darkness and brightness measured
in lux). Testing was conducted with 16 representative phones of different models and
operating systems. Phones were tested under “boundary conditions” of light intensity that
were the minimum light intensity and the maximum light intensity at which the device
allows the phone to take a picture of the color board and urine test strip (under lighting
conditions that exceeded the “boundary conditions” of light intensity i.e., darkness or
brightness, the application blocks the user from taking a picture). The results of this
testing support that the device is not impacted by different light intensities.
4. Distance and Angle
Testing was conducted with 16 representative smart phones of different models and operating
systems. Each phone was tested under “boundary conditions” that were 2 different distance
conditions and 2 different angle conditions. The distance conditions were the longest distance
from the color board and the shortest distance from the color board at which the device
allowed the phone to take a picture of the strip and color board (at longer or shorter distances,
the device blocks the user from taking a picture). The angle conditions were the most acute
and most obtuse angles at which the device allowed the phone to take a picture of the urine
test strip and color board (at more acute or obtuse angles, the device blocks the user from
taking a picture). The performance of the device was not impacted under these “boundary
conditions”.
5. Shadow
Testing was conducted with 16 representative smart phones of different models and operating
systems under different shadow configurations of different intensity and covering different
portions of the color-board and urine test strip. Six different shadow configurations and 2
different shadow intensities were tested. For 3 of the shadow configurations, the device
blocked the user from taking a picture of the color-board and urine test strip. For the other 3
shadow configurations, the device performance was not impacted by the presence of shadows
on the color-board and test strip.
6. Blurring
Testing was conducted with 16 representative smart phones of different models and operating
systems under 14 different conditions of blurred images consisting of different levels of
focus and motion blur. Under conditions that the devices detected too much image blur, the
user was blocked from taking a picture of the color-board and the urine test strip. Under
conditions where the device allowed a picture of the color-board and urine test strip to be
taken, the device performance was not impacted by image blur.

--- Page 17 ---
7. Misplaced Urine Stick
Testing was conducted with 16 representative smart phones of different models and operating
systems with 8 different urine test strip placements. Of the 8 different placements, 4 urine
test strip placements were recognized as invalid by the device and the device blocked the
user from taking a picture of the color-board and urine test strip. When the device determined
the stick placement to be valid, variations in stick placement did not impact the performance
of the device.
8. Dirty Color-Board
Testing was conducted with 16 representative smart phones of different models and operating
systems. Testing was conducted with 3 substances (urine, coffee, and ink) and 3 different
“dirty” configurations covering different sections of the color-board and urine test strip. The
device blocked the user from taking a picture of the color-board and urine test strip under
“dirty” configurations that the device determined to be invalid. Under the “dirty” conditions
the device determined to be valid, the performance of the device was not impacted.
9. Operating Conditions
Testing was conducted at four different operating conditions: 95% relative humidity (RH) at
35°C, 95% RH at 10°C, 10% RH at 35°C, and 10% RH at 10°C. Testing was conducted
using two representative smart phones of different models. The performance of the device
was not impacted under the conditions tested.
