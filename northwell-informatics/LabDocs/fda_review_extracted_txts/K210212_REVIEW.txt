III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Psychemedics homogeneous enzyme immunoassay (HEIA) for amphetamines in hair is an
enzyme immunoassay system for the preliminary qualitative detection of methamphetamine in
human head and body hair using a methamphetamine calibrator at 3 ng methamphetamine/10 mg
hair or 5 ng methamphetamine/10 mg hair for the purpose of identifying methamphetamine use,
and for the preliminary qualitative detection of amphetamine in human head and body hair using
an amphetamine calibrator at 3 ng amphetamine/10 mg hair for the purpose of identifying
amphetamine use. This is an in vitro diagnostic device intended exclusively for Psychemedics
use only and is not for sale to anyone.
The Psychemedics HEIA Amphetamines Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result.
A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical test result. Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry
(LC/MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The Olympus AU 640 analyzer was used for validation of the candidate assay.
The confirmation assay uses an AB Sciex 3200 LC/MS/MS linked to two LC-20AD Prominence
Liquid Chromatograph Pumps and a LEAP PAL HTC-xt autosampler.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Psychemedics homogeneous enzyme immunoassay (HEIA) test for amphetamines in hair
consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to extract amphetamines or
methamphetamines from the solid hair matrix to a measurable liquid matrix) and the screening
assay, the Psychemedics Amphetamines HEIA.
The Psychemedics Amphetamines HEIA consists of reagents R1 (anti-methamphetamine
monoclonal antibody with substrate) and R2 (methamphetamine labeled recombinant
G6PDH) for the detection of methamphetamine, and reagents R1 (anti-amphetamine
monoclonal antibody with substrate) and R2 (amphetamine labeled recombinant G6PDH) for
the detection of amphetamine.
The confirmation assay consists of an AB Sciex 3200 LC/MS/MS linked to two LC-20AD
Prominence Liquid Chromatograph Pumps and a LEAP PAL HTC-xt autosampler.
K210212 - Page 2 of 16

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
Hair sample extracts are combined with methamphetamine antibody and methamphetamine-
labeled G6PDH and amphetamine antibody and amphetamine-labeled G6PDH using a chemistry
autoanalyzer. The assay is based on competition between the drug-labeled G6PDH and free drug
from the extracted hair sample for a fixed amount of specific antibody binding sites. In the
absence of free drug from the samples, the specific antibody binds the drug-labeled G6PDH and
causes a decrease in enzyme activity. This phenomenon creates a direct relationship between the
drug concentration in hair and enzyme activity. The enzyme activity is determined
spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
For samples that are presumptive positive by the screening assay, a new aliquot of the hair
sample is weighed, washed extensively to remove externally derived methamphetamine and
amphetamine, extracted by a different procedure and confirmed by LC/MS/MS for the presence
of methamphetamine and amphetamine.

The screening immunoassays are qualitative tests. An evaluation of linearity is not
applicable.
LC-MS/MS Linearity:
The following concentrations were analyzed: 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, 25.0 and 50
ng methamphetamine and amphetamine per 10 mg of hair.
All results were within 20% of the target concentrations. Agreement of the 5 determinations
at each concentration was ≤10% CV. The regression coefficient was > 0.995. The actual data
points deviated <20% from the regression line.
The LC-MS/MS assay is used only to determine if the concentration of the target analyte is
above or below the cutoff. There are no clinical claims for concentrations other than the
cutoff.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross Reactivity:
Samples consisting of 8 mg hair were added to various compounds to determine cross
reactivity. Structurally similar compounds were tested individually in the the candidate assay
using the methamphetamine and amphetamine reagents to an expected cross reactivity of 1%
(e.g., for the 5 ng methamphetamine/10 mg hair calibrator to 500 ng cross reactor/10 mg hair,
for the 3 ng methamphetamine or amphetamine/10 mg hair calibrator to 300 ng cross
reactor/10 mg hair). Structurally similar compounds that cross reacted at 1% were then tested
at decreasing concentrations until the compound produced a positive result against the
methamphetamine or amphetamine calibrator. Structurally dissimilar compounds (100 ng/10
mg hair) were tested individually as cross-reactants in the candidate assay using the
methamphetamine and amphetamine reagents.
The cross-reactivity of the following metabolites and methamphetamines structural analogs
was evaluated by determining the minimum concentration that would result approximately
equivalent to the 3.0 ng methamphetamine/10 mg hair and 5.0 ng methamphetamine/10 mg
cutoffs.

Immunoassay: Effect of cosmetic treatments
Head hair samples negative for methamphetamines and amphetamines and head hair samples
positive for methamphetamines and amphetamines were treated with the following cosmetic
treatments: permanent wave, relaxer, dye (which includes bleach), and shampoo. The study
included 5 amphetamines-negative samples and 4 amphetamines-positive samples with each
of the treatments along with 5 methamphetamines-negative and 4 methamphetamines-
positive samples with the exception of permed methamphetamines negative samples which
contained 4 negative samples. The results were compared to the same samples without
treatments. All of the positive samples were previously analyzed by the confirmation
procedure for amphetamines and methamphetamines. After the treatments these samples and
an aliquot of the same hair samples untreated were extracted for amphetamines and
methamphetamines analysis and then assayed by the candidate assay using the
methamphetamine and amphetamine reagents. The results with and without treatment are
compared to detect interference in the assay or loss of drug due to the treatments. No
negative samples turned positive, and no positive samples became negative.

Specificity of the LC-MS/MS method
An interference study was conducted for the LC-MS/MS method by spiking potential
interferents into negative hair specimens that did not contain any drug, and individually into
hair specimens containing drug. Two aliquots of each compound or mix of compounds were
analyzed with 2.0 ng methamphetamine and 1.2 ng amphetamine per 10 mg hair, and one
without methamphetamine and amphetamine. The sponsor concluded that the potentially
interfering compounds listed below did not cross-react or cause interference with the LC-
MS/MS assay.
The following compound was tested at 2000 ng/10mg hair: Warfarin.
The following compounds were tested at 500 ng/10mg hair: Gabapentin, Pregabalin,
Salicylic Acid, Valproic Acid, Vigabatrin, Acetaminophen, (-)-Cotinine, S-(-)-Nicotine,
Caffeine.
The following compounds were tested at 200 ng/10mg hair: Morphine, Oxycodone, Codeine,
Cocaine, Phencyclidine, S-(+)-Methamphetamine, S-(+) Amphetamine, (±)-Methadone,
Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, R-(-)-Phenylephrine HCl, Carbamazepine, Salicylic Acid, Valproic
Acid, Oxcarbazepine, Buprenorphine, Cis-Tramadol HCl, Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone,
Meperidine, Naloxone, Naltrexone, Oxymorphone, Aripiprazole, Lacosamide,
Oxocarbazepine, Rufinamide.
The following compounds were tested at 100 ng/ 10mg hair: Carbamazepine, Levetiracetam,
Metformin HCl, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, R-(-)-Phenylephrine HCl, Sertraline HCl,
Topiramate, Zolpidem Tartrate, Zonisamide, Carbamazepine, Levetiracetam, (+)-

Loratadine, Montelukast·Na Salt, Pioglitazone·HCl, Procainamide·HCl, Simvastatin,
Ibuprofen, Naproxen, (+)-Propoxyphene.
The following compounds were tested at 25ng/10mg hair: Cetirizine·2HCl, Prednisolone.
The following compounds were tested at 20ng/10 mg hair: Clonazepam, Estazolam,
Flurazepam, Flunitrazepam, Midazolam, Nitrazepam, Prazepam, Triazolam, Zolpidem,
Phentermine, R, R-(-)-Pseudoephedrine, Meprobamate, Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Fentanyl.
The following compounds were tested at 2.5ng/10mg hair: Amlopidine Besylate
4. Assay Reportable Range:
An assay reportable range is not applicable for the candidate assay using the
methamphetamine and amphetamine reagents because they are qualitative only.
K210212 - Page 13 of 16

--- Page 14 ---
The claimed reportable range for the analytes methamphetamine and amphetamine
measured by the LC-MS/MS method are as follows: 0.25 ng/10 mg hair to 50
ng/10mg of hair.
This reportable range is supported by the linearity, precision, and lower limit of quantitation
(LLOQ) studies.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability: The methamphetamine and amphetamine calibrators are traceable to certified
reference materials from a commercial source.
Sample Shipping Stability During Storage: Nine (9) methamphetamine positive samples
remained positive after approximately 8 months in storage and after shipping twice coast to
coast. Nine (9) amphetamine positive samples remained positive after approximately 6
months in storage and after shipping twice coast to coast.
6. Detection Limit:
The candidate screening test yield qualitative results only; therefore, a detection limit
evaluation is not applicable. See section VII.A.1. above for performance around the
candidate device cutoff.
Detection Limit of the LC-MS/MS method
The sponsor performed a study to determine the Lower limit of Quantitation (LLOQ) of the
confirmatory LC-MS/MS assay for amphetamine and methamphetamine.
The LLOQ is the lowest claimed concentration that can be quantitated within 20% of the
expected value for methamphetamine and amphetamine. This was found to be 0.25 ng/10 mg
hair for methamphetamine and amphetamine.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Refer to Precision Studies above.
