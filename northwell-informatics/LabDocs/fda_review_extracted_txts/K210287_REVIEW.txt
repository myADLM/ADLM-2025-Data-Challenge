C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Limitation:
"The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s) is unknown
because resistant strains were either not available or an insufficient number were encountered at
the time of comparative testing:
• Cefotaxime (ctx01n): Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A ß-hemolytic streptococci) and
Streptococcus spp ß-hemolytic Group (other than S. pyogenes )".
D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 COMPACT Systems.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each
VITEK 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well containing only culture medium is
included on all cards, with the remaining wells containing premeasured amounts of a specific
antimicrobial agent in a culture medium base. A suspension of organism from a pure culture
is prepared in a tube containing 0.45-0.5% sterile saline and standardized to a McFarland 0.5
using the DensiCHEK Plus. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals and places the
card into the incubator/reader; manual methods can also be used for the inoculation of test
cards for use in the VITEK 2 System. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling and
sealing operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that
contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial
contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-Streptococcus Cefotaxime has the following concentrations in the card: 0.25,
0.5, 1, and 2 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The
MIC result reporting range for the card is ≤0.125 - ≥ 8 µg/mL. For all species, the MIC
results range indicates that the VITEK 2 system is capable of producing the following MIC
results ≤0.125, 0.25. 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and ≥ 8 µg/mL for AST-ST Cefotaxime test. This means the
VITEK 2 systems does not provide results lower than 0.125 µg/mL, or greater than 8 µg/mL
for the AST-ST Cefotaxime test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection
using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics used in the systems use
visible light to directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells.
Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth
K210287 - Page 3 of 14

--- Page 4 ---
has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth
by how much light is prevented from going through the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors
the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion of the
incubation cycle, a report is automatically generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Refer to K121863. Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST Streptococcus Cefotaxime
was performed in support of clearance of K121863 and was determined acceptable.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

Quality Control (QC) testing, Inoculum and Growth failure for the VITEK 2 AST
Streptococcus Cefotaxime was performed in support of clearance of K121863 and was
determined acceptable. QC testing specific to the changes in breakpoints was not performed
in the current submission.
The QC organism recommended by both the FDA and CLSI, namely Streptococcus
pneumoniae ATCC 49619, was tested against Cefotaxime during the clinical study a
K210287 - Page 6 of 14

minimum 20 times/site by the VITEK 2 automatic and the manual dilution and the VITEK 2
Compact system using the manual dilution. The QC organism was tested by the VITEK 2
AST card and the reference broth microdilution method.
At the time of the original submission (K121863), the QC range for S. pneumoniae ATCC
49619 was 0.06-0.25µg/mL. The recommended CLSI QC range for this strain changed to
include lower concentrations with a range of 0.03-0.12 µg/mL. However, the VITEK 2 MIC
reporting range is ≤0.125 – ≥8 µg/mL. The VITEK 2 systems does not provide results lower
than 0.125 µg/mL. Therefore, all QC results for S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 are off scale for
the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as both VITEK systems report the lowest end
of the scale as ≤ 0.12 µg/mL. An MIC value of ≤0.12 µg/mL indicated that the quality
control test results were acceptable (Table 1).

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The VITEK 2 AST-ST Cefotaxime ≤0.125 -≥8, which was originally cleared in K121863,
included indications for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A beta-
hemolytic streptococci) and Streptococcus spp tested with the VITEK 2 auto dilution and the
VITEK 2 manual dilution and compared to the CLSI broth microdilution.
The performance of the VITEK 2 AST-ST Cefotaxime card with Streptocococcus spp.
(Viridans Group), Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) and
Streptococcus spp (ß-hemolytic Group other than S. pyogenes) using revised interpretive
criteria currently recognized by FDA was evaluated in the current submission using data
obtained in support of K121863.
Since there was no change in the design or the dilution range of the VITEK 2 AST-ST card,
the performance evaluation was achieved via re-analysis of the MIC data of the original
510(k) submission (K121863).
Even though the breakpoints for Streptococcus pneumoniae (meningitis) and (non-
meningitis) did not change compared to the original submission, the performance of this
organism as compared to the reference method was re-analyzed in the current submission.
A total of 1623 (clinical and challenge) Streptococcus spp. isolates were tested using the
VITEK 2 with automatic dilution. The isolates included 1416 clinical isolates and 207
challenge isolates.
Results of the re-analyzed 1623 Streptococcus spp. clinical and challenge isolates (including
351 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 408 Streptococcus spp. Viridans Group, 310 Streptococcus
pyogenes (Group A ß-hemolytic streptococci) and 554 Streptococcus spp. ß-hemolytic
Group (other than S. pyogenes) are summarized in Table 2.
The previously collected data for the 207 challenge isolates tested at a single site with the
VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact Systems using the manual dilution was also re-analyzed
using the current breakpoints for Streptococcus spp Viridans Group, S. pyogenes (Group A
beta-hemolytic streptococci) and Streptococcus spp. ß-Hemolytic Group (other than S.
pyogenes). The results of the re-analysis are outlined in Table 3.

EA – Essential Agreement (+/- 2 dilutions) min – minor discrepancies
CA – Category Agreement maj – major discrepancies
EVAL – Evaluable isolates vmj – very major discrepancies
R – Resistant
NS-Non-susceptible
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference method
and that of VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic.
Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the VITEK 2 test card and the reference
method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference
method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK 2 test card.
When applying the new breakpoints of ≤1 (S), 2 (I), ≥4 (R) for Streptococcus spp. Viridans
Group, the performance of the combined isolates tested with the VITEK 2 and automatic
dilution is acceptable with 97.3% EA and 97.1% CA. There were no very major errors and
no major errors. Twelve (12) minor errors out of 408 isolates (2.9%) tested were observed
(Table 2).
When applying the new “susceptible only” breakpoints of ≤0.5 for S. pyogenes (Group A ß-
hemolytic streptococci), the performance of combined isolates tested with the VITEK 2 and
automatic dilution is acceptable with 100% EA and 100% CA. There were no very major
errors and no major errors observed (Table 2).

no very major errors and no major errors observed (Table 2).
Even though the breakpoints of S. pneumoniae (meningitis and non-meningitis breakpoints)
did not change from the original submission (K121863), the performance of this organism
was re-analyzed in the current submission to align with FDA current analysis of the
evaluable results for Essential Agreement. For both, the non-meningitis and the meningitis
breakpoints, no changes were observed in the %EA and the %CA and the performance
remained acceptable. Applying the FDA current analysis resulted in a decreased percent
evaluable EA for S. pneumoniae (non-meningitis and meningitis breakpoints) from 96.6% (in
the original K121863 submission) to 95.8% in the current submission (Table 2).

manual dilution and the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems is acceptable with % EA and
% CA >90%. There were no very major errors and no major errors observed. (Table 3).
For S. pneumoniae challenge isolates (non-meningitis and meningitis breakpoints) tested with the
manual dilution and the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems, no changes were observed in
the %EA, %CA and the % Evaluable EA compared to the original submission (K121863). The
performance remained acceptable. (Table 3).
As required under 511A (2) (2) (B) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the following
statement was included under Precautions Section in the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this AST
device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials
for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those found in the
indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of susceptibility
information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for specific antimicrobial
drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.
Resistant Isolates Tested:
A total number of 12 Streptococcus spp. (Viridans Group) isolates out of 408 isolates tested
(3%) provided resistant results with the revised breakpoints. The resistance has not
drastically changed since the original clearance and the data set is still appropriate for
evaluation with the new breakpoints. Based on the time of initial testing, the resistant strains
evaluated in the original study likely represent the current resistance population.
Resistant strains of S. pyogenes (Group A ß-Hemolytic streptococci) and Streptococcus spp
ß-Hemolytic Group were not available for testing in K121863.
bioMérieux included the following limitation in the device labeling:
“The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s) is
unknown because resistant strains were either not available or an insufficient number were
encountered at the time of comparative testing:
• Cefotaxime (ctx01n): Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A ß-hemolytic streptococci) and
Streptococcus spp ß-hemolytic Group (other than S. pyogenes)”.
Cefotaxime current interpretative criteria does not have intermediate or resistant interpretive
criteria for Streptococcus spp ß-Hemolytic Group (including S. pyogenes).
bioMérieux also added the following footnote under the performance Table in the device
labeling:
“NS-The current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining any results other than
“Susceptible”. Isolates yielding MIC results suggestive of NonSusceptible category
should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing”.

For S. pneumoniae challenge isolates (non-meningitis and meningitis breakpoints) tested with the
manual dilution and the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems, no changes were observed in
the %EA, %CA and the % Evaluable EA compared to the original submission (K121863). The
performance remained acceptable. (Table 3).

Trending
A trending re-analysis was performed using the combined (challenge and clinical) data
obtained in K121863 from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method for all Streptococcus spp to
align with current trending analysis.
This trending calculation takes into account the MIC values that are determined to be one or
more doubling dilutions lower or higher than the reference method irrespective of whether
the device MIC values are on-scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution
lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are
not considered int the trending analysis.
When the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs. lower readings was
greater than 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined to be statistically
significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that showed higher or
lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in the labeling.
The evaluation of the MIC results for Streptococcus spp (Viridans Group) using auto dilution
on the VITEK 2 instrument showed a trend toward lower MIC values when compared to the
reference method (Table 5). No trending was observed with Streptococcus pneumoniae
(meningitis and non-meningitis breakpoints), Streptococcus spp (beta-Hemolytic Group) and
S. pyogenes (Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) (Table 5).

*A positive percent difference value indicates higher MIC when compared to the reference method; A negative percent
difference value indicates lower MIC when compared to the reference method.
To address the observed trending, bioMérieux included the following footnote to the
performance table in the device labeling:
“The VITEK 2 Cefotaxime MIC values for Streptococcus spp Viridans Group tended to be at
least one doubling dilution lower than the reference method and may contribute to the
occurrence of very major errors”.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device when evaluated with
the current FDA-recognized Cefotaxime breakpoints.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 System with Cefotaxime when revised breakpoints for
Cefotaxime are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, BioMérieux will update the
Cefotaxime device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
