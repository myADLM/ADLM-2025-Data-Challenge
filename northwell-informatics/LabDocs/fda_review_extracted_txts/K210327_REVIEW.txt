Configuration of the First Sign Multi-Drug Test Dip Card can consist of any combination of the
above listed drug analytes.
The test may yield positive results for the prescription drugs Buprenorphine, Oxazepam,
Butalbital, Nortriptyline, Propoxyphene and Oxycodone when taken at or above prescribed
doses. It is not intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse of these drugs. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when the preliminary result is positive. The test provides only preliminary test
results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The FIRST SIGN Multi-Drug Test Dip Card, FIRST SIGN Multi-Drug Test Cup, FIRST SIGN
Multi-Drug Screen Test Dip Card, FIRST SIGN Multi-Drug Screen Test Cup are
immunochromatograph assays for the qualitative desction of Amphetamine, Buprenorphine,
Butalbital, Oxazepam, Cocaine, 2- ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine,
K210327 - Page 5 of 17

--- Page 6 ---
Methamphetamine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Morphine, Methadone, Oxycodone,
Phencyclidine,
Propoxyphene, Nortriptyline and Marijuana in human urine. Each assay uses a monoclonal
antibodydye conjugate against drugs with gold chloride and fixed drug-protein conjugates and
anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody in membranes.
B Principle of Operation:
The First Sign Multi-Drug Test Dip Card, First Sign Multi-Drug Test Cup, First Sign Multi-Drug
Screen Test Dip Card, and First Sign Multi-Drug Screen Test Cup are rapid tests for the
qualitative detection of Amphetamine, Oxazepam, Cocaine, Marijuana, Methamphetamine,
Morphine, Oxycodone, Butalbital, Methadone, Buprenorphine, Phencyclidine,
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Tricyclic Antidepressants, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-
diphenylpyrrolidine and Propoxyphene in urine samples. The tests are lateral flow
chromatographic immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary
action. If target drugs present in the urine specimen are below the cut-off concentration, it will
not saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles.
The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible
colored line will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line
region if the target drug level exceeds its cutoff-concentration because it will saturate all the
binding sites of the antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in the control region of
the devices regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the
tests have been performed properly.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of ±100%, ±75%, ±50%,
±25% from the cutoff and at the 300 ng/mL cutoff for Propoxyphene (PPX). Samples with
concentration of -100% cutoff were drug-free urines samples. Other samples were prepared
by spiking target drug in drug-free urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by
LC/MS or GC/MS. For each concentration, tests were performed two runs per day for 25

Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH:
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples, with 1.000 to
1.035 specific gravity or urine samples with pH 4 to 9 were spiked with target drugs at
25% below and 25% above propoxyphene cut-off levels. These samples were tested using
three lots of each device. Results were all positive for samples at and above +25% cut-off
and all negative for samples at and below -25% cut-off. There were no differences observed
between the First Sign Multi-Drug Test Dip Card and First Sign Multi-Drug Test Cup.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
A shelf-life stability of 24 months from the date of manufacture is claimed.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
See section VII.A.1.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study for the for the First Sign Multi-Drug Test Dip Card and the First
Sign Multi-Drug Test Cup were performed in-house by three laboratory personnel for each
candidate device. The operators tested 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical
samples for each drug. The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC/MS results. The
propoxyphene results are presented in the tables below. The accuracy data for AMP1000,
COC300 and THC were reported in k142353. The data for BUP, BAR and MOP 300 were
reported in k152551. The data for BZO, MET1000 and MOP 2000 were reported in
k150162. The data for MTD, PCP and OXY were reported in k151441. The data for EDDP,
MDMA and TCA were reported in k160793. The data for AMP 500, COC150 and MET 500
were reported in k171695.

Lay user study:
A lay user study was conducted at three intended user sites by 280 lay users for each device
format. The lay users had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and and ranged
in age from 18 to > 50 years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations;
negative, ±75%, ±50%, ±25% of the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine
specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was
aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with
the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. Each device was tested. Typical
results are summarized in the below tables.
