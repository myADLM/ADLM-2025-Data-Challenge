B Indication(s) for Use:
One Step Pregnancy Test is an over-the-counter lateral flow immunoassay for the qualitative
detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. The visual test is intended for home
use as an aid in early detection of pregnancy. The test is indicated for use from 4 days before the
expected period (5 days before the missed period).
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The One Step Pregnancy Test is an immunochromatographic sandwich assay containing a lateral
flow test strip housed in a cassette. Each test contains one cassette packaged in a pouch and one
pipette dropper.
B Principle of Operation:
The test strip contains monoclonal anti-hCG antibodies and goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody.
The test result is shown in the result window and read visually between 3 - 10 minutes of urine
application. If hCG is present in the urine sample, it is bound by a conjugated monoclonal anti α-
hCG antibody forming an anti hCG-antibody-gold complex. The sample is drawn through the
nitrocellulose membrane by capillary action. At the test (T) line, any hCG present is bound by
immobilized anti-β hCG antibody forming a sandwich, immobilizing gold particles, and giving
rise to a colored line. If no hCG is present in the sample, there is no binding at the test line and
subsequently, no colored line. The appearance of two colored lines in the result window, the test
(T) line and control (C) line, indicates a positive result. The appearance of one colored line in the
result window, the control (C) line, indicates a negative result. If there is no control (C) line, the
test has not run correctly and is an invalid result.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative device.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity:
The One Step Pregnancy Test device was tested for potential cross-reactivity from luteinizing
hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
Urine specimens from non-pregnant females were pooled and used to prepare samples with
hCG levels <0.5 mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL that were then spiked with 500 mIU/mL LH, 1000
mIU/mL FSH, and 1 mIU/mL TSH.
The results demonstrated no cross-reactivity up to 500 mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH, and
1 mIU/mL TSH in either negative or positive urine samples.
Interference:
The One Step Pregnancy Test device was tested with potentially interfering substances.
Urine specimens from non-pregnant females were pooled and used to prepare samples with
hCG levels <0.5mIU/mL and 25mIU/mL that were then spiked with interfering substances.
Each condition was tested with five devices from each of three lots for each of the two hCG
concentrations. No interference effect was observed at the tested concentrations shown in
table below:

Effect of hCG β-core fragment:
To evaluate potential interference from hCG β core fragment (hCGβcf), several combinations
and concentrations of hCG and hCGβcf were tested using multiple devices from 3 lots. No
hCGβcf interference was observed for the following test conditions:
Positive urine samples (pooled from pregnant females that were at weeks 6-7 from
o
last menstrual period) spiked up to 1μM hCGβcf.
Negative pooled urine (<0.5mIU/mL hCG) spiked with hCG to a concentration
o
representative of a sample from a 6-7 weeks pregnant female (25,362 mIU/mL), then
spiked with 1μM hCGβcf.
Positive urine samples (pooled from pregnant females that were at weeks 9-12 from
o
last menstrual period) spiked up to 1μM hCGβcf.
Negative pooled urine spiked with hCG to a concentration representative of a sample
o
from a 9-12 weeks pregnant female (46,920 mIU/mL), then spiked with 1μM
hCGβcf.
Negative pooled urine spiked to 25 mIU/mL hCG, then spiked with hCGβcf to a
o
concentration 5x the molar concentration of hCG (i.e., 375 pM hCGβcf).
Effect of urine pH:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in pH, urine samples containing 0 mIU/mL
and 25mIU/mL hCG were tested at pH values of 4.0 to 9.0. Each hCG concentration was
tested with 15 devices, five from each of three lots per pH condition. The results
demonstrated that samples within the pH range of 4.0 to 9.0 do not interfere with either
positive or negative results from the device.
Effect of urine specific gravity:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, urine samples containing
<0.5mIU/mL and 25mIU/mL hCG were adjusted to a specific gravity values from 1.000 to
1.035. Each hCG concentration was tested with 15 devices, five from each of three lots per

menopausal), 41–55 years of age (peri-menopausal) and >56 year of age (post-
menopausal). A total of 433 subjects provided urine samples including 133 from pre-
menopausal patients (also included in the method comparison study), 150 from peri-
menopausal patients, and 150 from post-menopausal patients. All 433 urine samples
were tested with three lots of One Step Pregnancy Test devices. No positive results
were observed in any of the age groups.
