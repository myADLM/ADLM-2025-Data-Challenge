B Indication(s) for Use:
The XW-100 Automated Hematology Analyzer (XW-100) is a quantitative automated
hematology analyzer intended for in vitro diagnostic use to classify and enumerate the following
parameters for venous whole blood anticoagulated with K2/K3 EDTA: WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT,
MCV, PLT, LYM%, Other WBC%, NEUT%, LYM#, Other WBC#, and NEUT#. It is not for
use in diagnosing or monitoring patients with primary or secondary chronic hematologic
diseases/disorders, oncology patients, critically ill patients, or children under the age of 2.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The XW-100 is intended to be used by operators with a minimum of an earned high school
diploma or equivalent.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The XW-100 Automated Hematology Analyzer (XW-100) for CLIA Waived Use is an electrical
resistance blood cell counter. This technology may also be referred to as Direct Current (DC) or
impedance. The XW-100 analyzes human whole blood specimens anticoagulated with K2EDTA
or K3EDTA and reports results for 12 hematology parameters, including the basic complete
blood count (CBC), 3-part white blood cell (WBC) differential, and MCV.
Principles of Operation
The XW-100 uses direct current with hydrodynamic focusing for all parameters except
hemoglobin, which is measured photometrically. The patient sample is aspirated, measured,
diluted with diluent (and lysed for WBC measurement), then directed into a transducer chamber
by a hydrodynamic focusing nozzle. The transducer chamber has a minute hole, or aperture.
Electrodes are mounted on both sides of the aperture chamber, through which the direct current
flows. Blood cells suspended in the diluted sample are injected through the aperture by the
hydrodynamic focusing nozzle. The hydrodynamic focusing nozzle is positioned in front of the
aperture and in line with the aperture’s center. All blood cells are separated from each other and
pass through the aperture in one direction, one cell at a time. When a cell passes through the
aperture, it causes a change in the direct current resistance, which is proportional to the cell’s
size. These resistance changes are captured as electric pulses. The various blood cell counts are
calculated by counting the pulses that occur in each cell size category. The analyzer then
determines blood cell volume and identifies cells by creating and analyzing histograms of the
various cell populations using their respective pulse heights. Hemoglobin is measured
photometrically using a non-cyanide method.

K210346 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification input is manual (by operator).
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The XW-100 processes anticoagulated venous whole blood collected in K2EDTA or
K3EDTA collection tubes. Samples are manually mixed by inversion and loaded into an
onboard sample adapter one at a time.
4. Calibration:
The XW-100 is factory calibrated.
5. Quality Control:
The XW-100 system performance is evaluated using XW QC CHECK, a stabilized whole

B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Internal study to evaluate new version of software v1.14 with modification to print
suppression rule
An internal study was performed to evaluate:
• The effectiveness of the new software version with suppression rule modification to
appropriately suppress parameters according to the XW-100 algorithm suppression
rules (used to simplify flagging for CLIA waived use).
• The results unsuppressed by the new software and to assess the accuracy of
unsuppressed results for all reported parameters.
A total of 139 residual whole blood samples (mix of normal and abnormal) collected in
K2EDTA anticoagulant were run on two XW-100 CLIA waived analyzers using the on-
market software version (v1.13) and within a target of one hour all samples were run on two
additional XW-100 CLIA waived analyzers using the proposed modified software version
(v1.14).
The results using both versions of software were compared to assess the frequency of
suppression for all parameters, as well as evaluate the comparability of the reported
parameters. Deming linear regression analysis was performed on all unsuppressed results for
all reported parameters. The results of this regression analysis are shown in the table below.

Conclusion: The results from this study demonstrated that the new version of software is
comparable to the prior version of software. Appropriate suppression of results is maintained
with the new version of software.
2. Sample challenge study
A prospective study was performed to confirm the appropriate suppression of results with
v1.14 software for samples associated with interferences, artifacts, or associated conditions
for which results from certain parameters should be suppressed in a CLIA Waived
environment. In this study, 173 pre-selected, de-identified leftover K2EDTA venous whole

The results of this study demonstrated that appropriate and expected suppression of results
occurred for the XW-100 CLIA Waived analyzer with v1.14 software for challenge samples,
as confirmed by blood smear analysis with WBC differential counts and results from the XN-
10 analyzer. Regression analysis indicated that the v1.14 software performed similar to the
previously cleared software (v1.03, K172604 and CW170012) and software currently on the
market (v1.13).

Conclusion: The software change does not impact the appropriate suppression of results for
challenging samples and unaffected parameters maintain similar performance to the
previously cleared XW-100 CLIA Waived analyzer.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
