III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Creatinine2 assay is used for the quantitation of creatinine in human serum, plasma, or
urine on the ARCHITECT c System.
The Creatinine2 assay is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of renal
diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for measuring other urine
analytes.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
ARCHITECT c8000 System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Creatinine2 assay is comprised of a reagent kit that is run on the ARCHITECT c8000
System. Each kit has two reagents; R1 and R2. R1 contains sodium hydroxide (0.8 mol/L) and
R2 contains picric acid (5.500 g/L). The Creatinine2 assay is calibrated using the Consolidated
Chemistry Calibrator, which is required but not provided with the kit. The product labeling
recommends running controls containing creatinine, but these are not provided with the kit.
B Principle of Operation:
The methodology of the Creatinine2 assay is that of a colorimetric assay. At alkaline pH, by
addition of sodium hydroxide, creatinine in the sample chemically reacts with a picric acid
reagent to form a creatinine-picrate complex. This reaction product has an absorbance at 500 nm.
The rate of increase in absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration of creatinine in
the sample.

instruments using three lots of creatinine reagent kits in duplicates per run, two runs per day,
over 20 day for a total of 80 measurements per instrument/lot. The results for each sample

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the Creatinine2 assay on the ARCHITECT c8000 across the analytical
measurement range was established in two studies measuring samples at concentrations
spanning the measurement range using one instrument and one reagent kit lot. In each study,
a high level creatinine samples was inter-mixed with a low level creatinine samples with
known dilutions to prepare samples which were uniformly distributed across the
measurement range. At least one concentration was included which exceeded the claimed
measurement range.
Serum:
Each of the 13 samples were measured in replicates of four on the ARCHITECT c8000
system. The observed creatinine concentrations versus the expected concentrations were
assessed for a linear response. Based on the results, the sponsor concluded that the creatinine

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the creatinine assay on the ARCHITECT c8000 was established
by conducting interference testing following the recommendations in CLSI EP07 ED3.
Serum
Interference from exogenous and endogenous substances was assessed using serum spiked
with creatinine at two concentrations of 0.6 mg/dL and 2.0 mg/dL. Each spiked sample was
further divided into two aliquots: test (with added interferent) and control (with no added
interferent, except total protein with normal level of 7 g/dL). Each sample was tested in 10
replicates using one lot and one instrument. A substance was identified as an interferent if the
difference in the mean between the control and test sample was outside of ±10% at the target
levels.
The following table lists the highest concentration of each substance at which no significant
interference was found. For any substances identified as an interferent, dose response testing
and analysis was conducted to assess the highest concentration limit below which no
significant interference is expected.

The sponsor includes the following limitations in the product labeling:
The Creatinine2 assay is susceptible to interference from cephalosporin class antibiotics
and eltrombopag at therapeutically relevant interferent concentrations. The assay is also
susceptible to interference from acetohexamide, bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated),
glucose, hydroxocobalamin, and total protein.
Urine
Interference from exogenous and endogenous substances was assessed using a normal urine
pool that was supplemented with a creatinine stock solution to yield a high creatinine sample
with a target concentration of 400 mg/dL. A low creatinine sample was prepared by diluting
a normal urine pool with artificial urine to yield a sample with a target concentration of 15
mg/dL. Each low and high sample was further divided into two aliquots: control (with no
added interferent) and test (with added interferent). Each sample was tested in 10 replicates
using one lot and one instrument. A substance was identified as an interferent if the
difference in the mean between the control and test sample was outside of ± 10% at target
levels of 15 mg/dL and 400 mg/dL.
The following table lists the concentrations of each substance at which no significant
interference was found. For any substances identified as an interferent, dose response testing
and analysis was conducted to assess the highest concentration limit below which no
significant interference is expected.

Serum
LoB
The LoB for the creatinine assay was evaluated using a zero-analyte sample. The sample was
measured in 60 replicates using each of three lots of the Creatinine2 reagent kits and two
instruments (total of six instrument and reagent lot combinations). The LoB was analyzed as
the 95th percentile from n = 60 replicates.
LoD
The LoD was evaluated using eight low-level samples. The samples were tested in replicates
of 10 using each of three lots of the Creatinine2 reagent kits and two instruments.
The LoD was analyzed using a parametric data analysis where the lowest concentration at
which the analyte can be detected with 95% probability based on n ≥ 60 replicates of low-
analyte level samples.
LoQ
To determine the LoQ, samples near the lower limit of the assay were run in replicates of 10
using each of three lots of the Creatinine2 reagent kits and two instruments. The LoQ was
defined as the lowest concentration of analyte which has imprecision less than or equal to
20% CV.

are summarized in the table below.

Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The accuracy of the creatinine assay on the ARCHITECT c8000 for serum and urine was
evaluated for agreement with the predicate device by an internal method comparison study.
Serum
In the study, a total of 128 serum samples were tested using three lots of the creatinine
reagent kit, and one lot each of calibrator and controls across two instruments. 3.9% (5/128)
of samples were prepared by spiking or diluting specimens. The data were analyzed by
Passing-Bablok regression analysis comparing the first replicate of the candidate device
result to the average of duplicates result of the comparator device:

Urine
A total of 129 urine samples were tested using three lots of the creatinine reagent kit, and one
lot each of calibrator and controls across two instruments. Less than 10% (7.0% [9/129]) of
samples were prepared by spiking or diluting specimens. The data were analyzed by Passing-
Bablok regression analysis comparing the first replicate of the candidate device result to the
average of duplicates result of the comparator device:

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix equivalency study was conducted to support use of the Creatinine2 assay with
additional specimen matrix types claimed in the product labeling: K2EDTA plasma, lithium
heparin plasma, lithium heparin (separator tube) plasma, serum (separator tube), and sodium
heparin plasma. In the study, donor matched venous specimens were collected into tubes of
each aforementioned anticoagulant. Each specimen was tested in singlicate using one lot of
kit and one ARCHITECT c8000 instrument, and the result compared to the mean of triplicate
serum measurements. A total of 11.3% (9/80) of the blood samples in the collection tubes
were supplemented with creatinine stock solution to create samples that spanned the
analytical measuring interval of the assay. A Passing-Bablok evaluation was performed,
regressing the concentration from the first replicate of each donor’s evaluation tube (y-axis)
versus the mean concentration of the control tube (x-axis). The slope and intercept of the
regression line, and the two-sided 95% CI around the slope and intercept were calculated.
The results are summarized as follows, and support the claimed use of K2EDTA plasma,
