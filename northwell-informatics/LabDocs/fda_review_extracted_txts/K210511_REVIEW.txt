III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
The InTray GC is a microbiological device intended to differentiate and support the growth of
pathogenic Neisseria gonorrhoeae when incubated at 35°C for 24-72 hours. Inoculated samples
can optionally be pre-incubated prior to transport when pre-incubated at 35°C for 24 hours.
Subsequent transport, of the pre-incubated specimen under controlled room temperature (18 to
25°C), is supported out to 72 hours.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as Intended Use above.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The InTray GC is a Modified Thayer-Martin medium within a sealed inner well. The inner seal
covers the inner well containing agar and an additional sealed cavity containing a CO generating
2
tablet. There is also an outer adhesive label seal with a window that does not fog up under 100%
relative humidity. The user opens and inoculates the surface of the medium with the patient
sample followed by resealing the outer adhesive label. High humidity within the InTray GC
causes the tablet to generate CO thus providing adequate bacterial growth condition for the
2
target pathogen. After incubation of the inoculated InTray GC, the bacterial growth can be
observed through the window without opening the InTray GC and therefore not disturbing the
established CO concentration. Observation of culture growth can be by eye, hand lens or
2
microscope.
B Principle of Operation:
InTray GC is a culture system that has built-in features, components and atmospheric conditions
that under certain incubation conditions allow for transport of inoculated specimens to facilitate
growth and detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. For transportation from the point of collection to
the laboratory, the inoculated InTray GC plate is pre-incubated at 35°C for 24 hours before
transportation. After appropriate inoculation, preincubation and other procedural steps, the
InTray GC is then transported in a sealed biohazard container to the laboratory for subsequent
incubation and microbiological examination using appropriate biosafety procedures.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:

4. Assay Reportable Range:

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Shelf life: The shelf life for the InTray GC was determined to be 12 months from the date of
manufacture. The shelf life of the InTray GC was established using a real time stability study
for the cleared InTray GC device that was cleared in 1999 (510k #: K993033).
Sterilization: The sponsor does not intend to claim that the InTray GC is provided sterile.
However, the manufacturing process for the InTray GC is based on ISO 13485:2016 standard
(Biomed holds certificate no. FM 545530) and ensures that InTray GC is aseptic. The
manufacturing steps include a filtration process using biopharmaceutical grade 0.2μM filter.
The aseptic status of the manufactured InTray GC is then validated by Quality Control
process which evaluates the absence of bacteria and fungi growth on the uninoculated agar
plate incubated at 37oC.
Performance analysis:
a. Transport Simulation: To determine the optimal specimen transport condition that
ensures recovery of viable N. gonorrhoeae in the InTray GC, various transport
conditions that simulated potential conditions in the healthcare operations were
evaluated to determine the clinical utility of the InTray GC as a specimen transport
device from site of collection to the laboratory. Four InTray GC replicates were
inoculated with approximately 20 colony forming units (CFU) for each experimental
group outlined in Table 1 below and the process was repeated with the five different
AR isolate bank strains (N. gonorrhoeae strains 0165, 0202, 0175, 0181 & 0197) and
N. gonorrhoeae strain ATCC 43069. One lot of InTray GC transport device was used
in the study.

b. Viability Assessment: Semi-quantitative assessment was performed by examining
both total CFU count and changes in the estimated average colony size. Inoculum was
verified on standard chocolate agar plates for all 5 N. gonorrhoeae strains and yielded
1.5 x 107 CFU/mL for all strains except AR0181 (4.88 x 105 CFU/mL). Experimental
groups C2 and C3 that were inoculated and then immediately exposed (no pre-
incubation) to 48 and 72 hours, respectively, of 18-25oC simulated transport
temperatures before incubation at 35°C for 72 hours showed no recovery of N.
gonorrhoeae at any time. Group C1, which was inoculated and immediately exposed
to 24 hours of 18-25°C transport temperatures before incubation at 35°C for 72 hours
showed very poor recovery. Group B, which served as a positive incubation control,
showed consistent increase in colony size over 144 hours (6 days) of incubation at
35°C. Group A, which was preincubated at 35°C for 24 hours after inoculation
followed by 72 hours of 18-25°C transport temperatures, demonstrated recovery via
increased colony sizes. This study demonstrated that pre-incubation at 35°C for 24
hours is required after plating the specimen in the InTray GC and this will be
reflected in labeling and instructions for use.
c. Comparative Assessment:
The InTray GC claims to support transport and recovery of N. gonorrhoeae were
evaluated using recovery studies described in CLSI M40-A2. Recovery and
enumeration of six N. gonorrhoeae strains with the subject InTray GC transport
device were compared to recovery of the same six strains inoculated with a swab into
a legally marketed transport device containing Amies media. The latter was cultured
on chocolate agar to enumerate organism recovery.
Multiple lots (12 different lots) that originated from lots of variously aged InTray GC
devices were used to test six strains of N. gonorrhoeae. Three lots of the InTray GC
devices were used for testing five of the six N. gonorrhoeae strains (N=15 replicates)
and two separate lots were used for one of the six N. gonorrhoeae strains tested (N=2
replicates). The InTray GC devices were inoculated using 20 µL of a 1.5x103

CFU/mL of N. gonorrhoeae sample in 0.85% saline. Group B experimental design
was used to establish time zero of incubation and Group A experimental design was
used to evaluate the 72-hour transport claim - schematic in Table 1 above.
Three replicates of the legally marketed transport device were used. The swab
included in the device was used to spike each of the six N. gonorrhoeae strains
(N=18). Chocolate agar culture media was used for the determination of the organism
recovery and for enumeration of the colony forming units recovered. The legally
marketed transport device was spiked with 1.5x107 CFU/mL of N. gonorrhoeae
sample in 0.85% saline. The differences in inoculum concentration between the
InTray GC device and the comparator was to account for the 24-hour pre-incubation
step and the size of the InTray GC device.
Acceptable recovery was achieved for each N. gonorrhoeae strain tested with a 72-
hour transport using the InTray GC. An average of Log difference of 0.08 (± SD
10
0.77), between time zero (no transport) and 72 hours (transport) followed by a 72hour
incubation at 35oC, across the six strains tested was observed. The change in CFU/mL
from time zero to the experiment endpoint of 72 hours at 35oC was ≤2 log , which
10
supports the shelf-life stability claims for the InTray GC, across multiple aged lots,
shows that InTray GC can maintain the viability of N. gonorrhoeae when the device
is transported.
Acceptable recovery performance was achieved for the legally marketed transport
device and culture. Culture recovery demonstrated that each of the N. gonorrhoeae
strains tested, with an average Log difference, between time zero and an incubation
10
time of 24 hours at room temperature (20-25oC), had an average -1.73 Log reduction
(± SD 0.52) across the six strains tested. A decline in the CFU/mL of ≤2 Log
10
between time zero and the end of the experimental incubation was considered
acceptable. These studies demonstrated that sufficient viability of N. gonorrhoeae
was achieved using traditional transport and culture techniques and supported the
conclusions regarding the InTray GC ability to maintain viability of N. gonorrhoeae.
The viability of the recovered N. gonorrhoeae strains at the end of the experiment
was confirmed by subculture on chocolate agar plates for all experimental groups.
The results substantiate that the InTray GC device may be used for transport when
following the new procedure.
