See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Both the Elecsys proBNP II and Elecsys proBNP II STAT have the following intended use:
Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of N terminal pro Brain natriuretic
peptide in human serum and plasma. This assay is used as an aid in the diagnosis of individuals
suspected of having heart failure. The test is further indicated for the risk stratification of patients
with acute coronary syndrome and heart failure. The test may also serve as an aid in the
assessment of increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients at risk for heart
failure who have stable coronary artery disease.
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on cobas e
immunoassay analyzers.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

D Special Instrument Requirements:
Performance data for this submission were generated using the cobas e 411 immunoassay
analyzer (Elecsys proBNP II) and the cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzer (Elecsys proBNP II
STAT).
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys proBNP II and the Elecsys proBNP II STAT consist of three reagents in separate
bottles labeled M, R1, and R2:
M: Streptavidin‑coated microparticles (transparent cap), 1 bottle, 6.5 mL: Streptavidin‑coated
microparticles 0.72 mg/mL; preservative.
R1: Anti‑NT‑proBNP‑Ab~biotin (gray cap), 1 bottle, 9 mL: Biotinylated monoclonal
anti‑NT‑proBNP antibody (mouse) 1.1 μg/mL; phosphate buffer 40 mmol/L, pH 5.8;
preservative.
R2: Anti‑NT‑proBNP‑Ab~Ru(bpy) (black cap), 1 bottle, 9 mL: Monoclonal anti‑NT‑proBNP
antibody (sheep) labeled with ruthenium complex 1.1 μg/mL; Biotin scavenger antibody 1.5
mg/mL; phosphate buffer 40 mmol/L, pH 5.8; preservative.
K210546 - Page 2 of 18

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The Elecsys proBNP II assay follows the procedure below:
1st incubation: Antigen in the sample (15 μL), a biotinylated monoclonal NT‑proBNP‑specific
antibody, and a monoclonal NT‑proBNP‑specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex
(Tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II)-complex ( )) to form a sandwich complex.
2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex becomes bound
to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed
with ProCell/ProCell M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent
emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument specifically generated by
2‑point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode or e‑barcode.
The Elecsys proBNP II STAT assay follows a similar procedure outlined above except that the
first and second incubations are combined into a single step.

2. Linearity:
One high analyte human, native serum sample with a NT-proBNP concentration above the
measuring rage was diluted with analyte free serum. A total of 11 concentrations were
prepared that spanned the measuring range. Samples were assayed in 3-fold determination
within a single run. Samples were tested using the Elecsys proBNP II on the cobas e 411 and
the Elecsys proBNP II STAT on the cobas e 601. The linearity data were analyzed per the
recommendations in CLSI EP06-Ed2.
The maximum deviation from linearity observed within the claimed measuring range for the
Elecsys proBNP II was -10.5%.
The maximum deviation from linearity observed within the claimed measuring range for the
Elecsys proBNP II STAT was -16.9%.
The results of the linearity study support that the Elecsys proBNP II and the Elecsys proBNP
II STAT are linear across the claimed measuring range of 36 pg/mL to 35000 pg/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous Compounds, Biotin, and Intralipid
The Elecsys proBNP II and Elecys proBNP II STAT were evaluated for potential
interference from endogenous compounds, intralipid, and biotin. Testing was conducted with
three levels of NT-proBNP: low (~125-140 pg/mL), medium (~800-1000 pg/mL), and high
(~18000-23000 pg/mL). Samples were measured using the Elecsys proBNP II on the cobas e
411 analyzer and using the Elecsys proBNP II STAT on the cobas e 601 analyzer.
Interference was defined as a mean percent recovery of samples containing potential

IU/mL rheumatoid factors, and ≤7 g/dL albumin. Although no significant interference was
observed in the presence of unconjugated bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, and biotin at the
concentrations listed in the table above, the sponsor is claiming that there is no significant
interference at lower concentrations of these compounds; the sponsor is claiming that there is
no significant interference in the presence of ≤25 mg/dL bilirubin and ≤3500 ng/mL biotin.
Cross-Reactivity
The cross-reactivity of the Elecsys proBNP II and Elecsys proBNP II STAT was evaluated
with two human native serum samples with low (about 150 pg/mL) and high (about 2500-
3000 pg/mL) NT-proBNP levels. The cross-reactant concentrations tested are the highest
concentration that may be expected in the intended use population. Samples were measured
using the Elecsys proBNP II on the cobas e 411 analyzer and using the Elecsys proBNP II
STAT on the cobas e 601 analyzer. Significant cross-reactivity was defined as a mean
percent recovery of samples containing potential cross-reactant that exceeds 100±10% of the
control sample.

the Elecsys proBNP II and the Elecsys proBNP II STAT.
Exogenous Substances
The Elecsys proBNP II and Elecys proBNP II STAT were evaluated for potential
interference from pharmaceutical compounds. Testing was conducted with two levels of
native human samples with ~125 pg/mL and ~2000 pg/mL NT-proBNP. The drugs and drug
levels tested were determined per recommendations in CLSI EP07 and CLSI EP37. Samples
were measured using the Elecsys proBNP II on the cobas e 411 analyzer and using the
Elecsys proBNP II STAT on the cobas e 601 analyzer. Interference was defined as a mean
percent recovery of samples containing potential interferent that exceeds 100±10% of the
control sample.
No significant interference was observed with the 50 pharmaceutical compounds listed in the

Limit of Detection (LoD):
The LoD of the Elecsys proBNP II on the cobas e 411 analyzer and of Elecsys proBNP II
STAT (updated assay) on the cobas e 601 analyzer was determined per recommendations in
CLSI EP17-A2. Five low-level human serum samples were measured on one instrument in
60 total determinations per sample per reagent lot. The study was conducted using three
reagent lots. The LoD was determined by parametric analysis.
The sponsor’s study supports the claimed LoD of 10 pg/mL for the Elecsys proBNP II and
the Elecsys proBNP II STAT.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ):
The LoQ of the Elecsys proBNP II on the cobas e 411 analyzer and of the Elecsys proBNP II
STAT on the cobas e 601 analyzer was determined per recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.
Nine native, unaltered serum samples were tested with the Elecsys proBNP II and 10 native,
unaltered serum samples were tested with the Elecsys proBNP II STAT. Each sample was
tested in 5 replicates on one instrument in singleton per day, over 5 days with 1 run per day.
Three lots of reagent were used in the study. A total of n=25 measured values were obtained
for each sample. The LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration of analyte which can
be measured with an intermediate precision of 20% CV.
The sponsor’s study supports the claimed LoQ of 36 pg/mL for the Elecsys proBNP II and
the Elecsys proBNP II STAT.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Previously established in K022516
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
a) Elecsys proBNP II
The sponsor obtained 2414 native serum samples each collected from independent
subjects in the sponsor’s intended use population from the US and Europe. The sponsor
conducted a Passing-Bablok regression analysis on 1940 native serum samples
comparing the measurements made using the biotin-remediated Elecsys proBNP II
(subject device, y) with measurements made using the non-biotin remediated Elecsys
proBNP II (predicate device, x). A total of 474 samples were not included in the
regression analysis because the NT-proBNP values fell outside the common measuring
range of the predicate and subject devices. The following Passing-Bablok regression fit
was determined from the comparison study:
y = 0.98x – 2.88
The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the estimate of the slope was between 0.98 and 0.98
and the 95% CI for the estimate of the intercept was between -3.20 and -2.46.
K210546 - Page 14 of 18

Based on the regression analysis above, the sponsor will include in the labeling the
following information concerning the predicted systematic differences between the
biotin-remediated Elecsys proBNP II and non-biotin-remediated Elecsys proBNP II
assays at different NT-proBNP concentrations:

The sponsor also conducted a concordance analysis with the 2414 native serum samples
collected from subjects in the US and Europe comparing the agreement between the
subject and predicate devices at the two age-dependent cutoffs (125 pg/mL for patients
<75 years of age and 450 pg/mL for patients ≥75 years of age). Of these subjects with a
confirmed diagnosis of heart failure (N = 1015), the total agreement between the subject
and predicate devices was 98.6% (1001/1015). Of the subjects without a confirmed heart
failure diagnosis (N =1399) the total agreement between the subject and predicate devices
was 98.7% (1381/1399). In a subset of US subjects, heart failure severity was classified
per the New York Heart Association Functional Classification for heart failure (NYHA
Class I-IV). The total agreement between the subject and predicate devices for subjects
classified in NYHA Classes I, II, II, and IV were 98% (193/197), 98.7% (224/227),
98.4% (254/258), and 98.2% (166/169), respectively.
b) Elecsys proBNP II STAT
The sponsor obtained 2414 native serum samples each collected independent subjects in
the sponsor’s intended use population from the US and Europe. The sponsor conducted a
Passing-Bablok regression analysis on 1928 native serum samples comparing the
measurements made using the biotin-remediated Elecsys proBNP II STAT (subject
device, y) with measurements made using the non-biotin remediated Elecsys proBNP II
STAT (predicate device, x). A total of 486 samples were not included in the regression
analysis because the NT-proBNP values fell outside the common measuring range of the
predicate and subject devices. The following Passing-Bablok regression fit was
determined from the comparison study:
y = 1.01x – 1.60
The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the estimate of the slope was between 1.00 and 1.01
and the 95% CI for the estimate of the intercept was between -2.09 and -1.16.
Based on the regression analysis above, the sponsor will include the following
information concerning the predicted systematic differences between the biotin-
remediated Elecsys proBNP II STAT and non-biotin-remediated Elecsys proBNP II

The sponsor also conducted a concordance analysis with the 2414 native serum samples
collected from subjects in the US and Europe comparing the agreement between the
subject and predicate devices at the two age-dependent cutoffs (125 pg/mL for patients
<75 years of age and 450 pg/mL for patients ≥75 years of age). Of these subjects with a
confirmed diagnosis of heart failure (N = 1015), the total agreement between the subject
and predicate devices was 99.7% (1012/1015). Of the subjects without a confirmed heart
failure diagnosis (N =1399) the total agreement between the subject and predicate devices
was 99.2% (1388/1399). In a subset of US subjects, heart failure severity was classified
per the New York Heart Association Functional Classification for heart failure (NYHA
Class I-IV). The total agreement between the subject and predicate devices for subjects
classified in NYHA Classes I, II, II, and IV were 100% (197/197), 99.6% (226/227),
99.6% (257/258), and 99.4% (168/169), respectively.
The sponsor provided information on the potential impact the performance characteristics of
the Elecsys proBNP II and the Elecsys proBNP II STAT may have on the labeled clinical
performance of the device. This information was reviewed and determined to support that the
clinical performance claims are applicable to the Elecsys proBNP II and Elecsys proBNP II
STAT.
The sponsor also provided information to support the use of the frozen samples used in the
method comparison and concordance studies.
2. Matrix Comparison:
The sponsor conducted a matrix comparison study with the Elecsys proBNP II on the cobas e
411 and with the Elecsys proBNP II STAT on the cobas e 601 by comparing values obtained
from testing matched native (single donors) serum, lithium heparin (Li-Heparin) plasma, and
K2-EDTA plasma samples. The following tables summarize the Passing-Bablok regression
analysis comparing the results from serum to those from lithium heparin plasma and K2-
EDTA plasma samples.
