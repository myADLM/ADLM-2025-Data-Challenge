Reagents
The ARCHITECT Toxo IgG assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) used
for the quantitative determination of IgG antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in human serum and
plasma on the ARCHITECT i System.
The ARCHITECT Toxo IgG assay is to be used as an aid in the determination of immune status to
Toxoplasma gondii in individuals, including women of child-bearing age, and as an aid in the
diagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii infection.
B Principle of Operation:
This assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative determination of IgG antibodies to
Toxoplasma gondii in human serum and plasma using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay
(CMIA) technology.
Pre-diluted sample, recombinant Toxoplasma gondii antigen (containing recombinant antigens
P30[SAG1] and P35[GRA8]) coated paramagnetic microparticles, and assay diluent are combined
and incubated. The Toxoplasma gondii specific antibodies present in the sample bind to the
recombinant Toxoplasma gondii antigen (containing recombinant antigens P30[SAG1] and
P35[GRA8]) coated microparticles. The mixture is washed. Murine anti-human IgG acridinium-
labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture and incubated. Following a wash cycle, Pre-
Trigger and Trigger Solutions are added.

The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit (RLU). There is a direct
relationship between the amount of anti-Toxo IgG in the sample and the RLU detected by the system
optics.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined based on guidance from the Clinical and

Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP05-A3. Samples
included a negative control, a positive control, and 5 panels numbered
1-5 respectively as follows: true negative, high negative, low positive,
moderate positive, and high positive.
Testing was performed using 1 ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument, 3
reagent lots, 3 calibrator lots, and 3 control lots.
Each reagent lot was paired with a different lot of calibrator. A
calibration per reagent lot was performed on each instrument by testing
the calibrators in replicates of 2.
The samples were tested in a minimum of 2 replicates (from separate
sample cups) 2 times per day (separated by a minimum of 2 hours) on
at least 20 different days.
The within-laboratory imprecision results for the ARCHITECT Toxo
IgG assay are shown in the following table:

a The indicated samples were not evaluated against evaluation criteria because the
observed mean values (Negative Control = 0.0 IU/mL; Panel 1 = 0.0 to 0.1 IU/mL;
Panel 2 = 1.4 to 1.5 IU/mL) were not within the range specified in the evaluation
criteria, where, only samples targeted between 3.0 IU/mL to the upper limit of the
analytical measuring interval (75.0 IU/mL). were evaluated.
The ARCHITECT Toxo IgG assay demonstrated acceptable precision.
2. Linearity:
A study was performed based on guidance from CLSI EP06-A.
One unique sample set, consisting of at least 9 samples/pools spanning the analytical measuring
range of the assay, was prepared as described in the table below, where sample/pool 1 was the
high sample and sample/pool 13 was the low sample.

Samples were tested in replicates of 10 along with calibrators and controls and the mean
observed concentration of each sample/pool was calculated. The %CV for all samples used in the
analysis were checked and found to be within the imprecision requirement of less than or equal
to 10 %CV for representative specimens within the range of 3.0 IU/mL to the upper limit of the
analytical measuring interval (75.0 IU/mL). The linearity of the ARCHITECT Toxo IgG assay
was considered acceptable if the data set was determined to be linear or if the deviation from
linearity was within or equal to ± 0.3 IU/mL for samples with concentrations < 3.0 IU/mL or
within or equal to ± 10% for samples with concentrations ≥ 3.0 IU/mL. This assay is linear
across the analytical measuring interval of 0.2 to 75.0 IU/mL

Interpretation of Results and
Concentration Values Instrument Interpretation Retest Procedure
< 1.6 IU/mL Nonreactive Individuals with such results are
presumed not to be infected with T
gondii and susceptible to acute
infection. A negative result does
not always exclude the possibility
of T gondii infection. Patients with
negative results in suspected early
disease cases should be retested in
3 weeks.
1.6 to < 2.7 IU/mL Grayzone/Equivocal Specimens that are considered
grayzone/equivocal may contain
low levels of anti-Toxo IgG. It is
recommended to obtain a second
sample within a reasonable period
of time (e.g., 2 weeks) and to
repeat ARCHITECT Toxo IgG
testing.
≥ 2.7 IU/mL Reactive Specimens that are considered
reactive for anti-Toxo IgG indicate
recent or past infection. A reactive
result does not distinguish between
recent and past infection.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A clinical study (method comparison) was performed in the US based on guidance from CLSI
EP12-A2, 2nd ed. to evaluate the percent agreement between the ARCHITECT Toxo IgG
investigational assay and a current FDA cleared commercially available anti-Toxo IgG assay
with routine order and preselected positive specimens collected in the US (n=777 for routine
order and n=84 for preselected positive) and outside of the US (n=482 for routine order and n=71
for preselected positive) and specimens collected from pregnant females in the US (n=200).

females was negative by Dye Test.
CDC Panel Agreement
The CDC Toxoplasma 1998 Human Serum Panel was obtained from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and tested on the ARCHITECT Toxo IgG assay. The results were
submitted to the CDC for data evaluation. The panel consisted of 70 true positive Toxoplasma
specimens and 30 true negative Toxoplasma specimens as defined by the Dye Test.
The ARCHITECT Toxo IgG assay detected 68 out of the 70 positive specimens as reactive and 2
out of the 70 positive specimens as grayzone/equivocal (both grayzone/equivocal specimens
were aliquots of the same sample). Of the 30 negative specimens, the ARCHITECT Toxo IgG
assay detected all 30 specimens as nonreactive.
The ARCHITECT Toxo IgG assay demonstrated 97% agreement with the positive specimens
(sensitivity) and 100% agreement with the negative specimens (specificity).
2. Matrix Comparison:
A study was performed to evaluate whether specific blood collection tube types are suitable for
use with the ARCHITECT Toxo IgG assay.
Samples were obtained from a specimen vendor from a minimum of 40 donors in the control
tube type (serum) and in the following evaluation tube types:
• serum separator
• tripotassium EDTA
• lithium heparin plasma separator
• lithium heparin
The blood collection tubes from one individual constituted one donor set. The samples were
processed by the vendor and the samples, which were collected by the vendor in the tube types

samples were tested neat.
Each sample was tested in a minimum of 2 replicates using 1 lot each of reagents, calibrator, and
controls on 1 ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument.
All of the blood collection tube types tested are acceptable for use with the ARCHITECT Toxo
IgG assay.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Due to geographic locations or demographics, assay results obtained in individual laboratories
may vary from data presented.
Of the 1614 specimens tested in the ARCHITECT Toxo IgG clinical study, 977 were from the
intended use population in the US. Either age or sex was not reported for 14 specimens. Of the
remaining 963 specimens, 763 (79.2%) were routine order (384 female and 379 male, 0 to 88
years old) and 200 (20.8%) were pregnant females (19 to 53 years old). The mean age of the 963
specimens was 40 years.
The ARCHITECT Toxo IgG assay was reactive in 110 (11.4%) of the collected specimens in the
intended use population in the US (n = 963). Testing of the specimens was performed at 3
clinical testing sites located in New York City and Farmingdale, New York and Palo Alto,
California.
