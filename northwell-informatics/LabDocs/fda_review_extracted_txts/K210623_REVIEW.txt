• Calibrators: A five level set in liquid form with target concentrations: 2.7 mg/L, 5.3 mg/L
16 mg/L, 48 mg/L and 96 mg/L, ready to use.
K210623 - Page 2 of 15

--- Page 3 ---
The FLC Lambda is comprised of the following reagents:
• Lambda Microplate: coated with polyclonal rabbit anti-human lambda FLC antibody
• Dilution Buffer
• Wash Solution
• Anti-Lambda Antiserum
• Stop Solution
• Calibrators: A five level set in liquid form with target concentrations: 2.9 mg/L, 5.9
mg/L, 17.7 mg/L, 53.0 mg/L and 106.0 mg/L, ready to use.
The following materials are required but not provided in the kits:
• Densitometer for microplate reading by absorbance spectrophotometry at 450 nm.
• FLC Control Level 1 with target concentrations for Kappa: 9–25 mg/L and Lambda: 15–
30 mg/L
• FLC Control Level 2 with target concentrations for Kappa and Lambda > 35 mg/L
FLC Control Level 1 and FLC Control Level 2 are intended for the quality control of SEBIA
immunoenzymatic procedures and are obtained from a pool of human sera. The controls are
packaged in a stabilized lyophilized form. It must be noted that the high limit of the FLC Control
Level 2 must not exceed the values of the Calibrator 5. Additionally, the exact concentrations for
FLC Control Level 1 and FLC control Level 2 are lot dependent.
B Principle of Operation:
The FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda assays are intended for the quantification of FLCs in human
serum from adults with an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) procedure utilizing
specific anti-Kappa and anti-Lambda FLC antibodies. Kappa FLC or Lambda FLC in the sample
binds to specific anti-Kappa FLC antibody or anti-Lambda FLC antibody coated on the wells of
microplates. Following the washing step, the samples in wells are incubated with an anti-FLC
antiserum (Kit specific) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed by another washing of
wells to remove the excess of the conjugated antiserum. Reading of the optical density is
performed by absorbance spectrophotometry at 450 nm of the colored product. Finally, the
calculation of the FLC concentration of the sample is performed using a calibration curve
obtained with calibrators that have been analyzed on the same microplate.

Site-to-Site Reproducibility:
Six samples including four serum samples (samples S1 to S4) and two controls (samples C1
and C2) were tested using the FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda kit. Each day, for five days, an
operator analyzed the same samples (five replicates per sample) on a microplate using one
reagent lot (same microplate design each day), yielding a total of 25 results per sample. The
same protocol was followed by two other operators in two other laboratories with the same
reagent lot. The SD and %CV were evaluated for within-day, between-day, within-site,
between-sites, and total reproducibility. The results are summarized in the table below:

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda assays was evaluated based on three panels
using native patient samples. Each panel was prepared by proportional mixing of one low
sample with concentration close to the concentration of the Calibrator 1 and one high sample
with concentration close to the concentration of the Calibrator 5 in order to reach 12
concentration levels. Each concentration level sample was tested in seven replicates using
one reagent lot of each FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda. The summary data for linearity study
of FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda are summarized in the table below.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous Interference Study
Three serum samples containing normal, medium and high analyte concentrations were
tested for the presence of endogenous interferants using FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda kits
based on the CLSI EP7-A2 and the CLSI EP07, 3rd Edition. The test samples were prepared
by supplementing interferants in the solvent (either saline or NaOH) to reach the desired
concentration of the interferant to be tested. Additionally, neat serum samples were
supplemented with the same volume of solvent, and these were considered blanks samples.
The test samples and blank samples were analyzed by one operator through one run and 10
replicates each for test and blank samples. Mean relative deviation was calculated for blank
and test sample and no significant interference (deviation < ±10%) was observed for each
tested interferant up to the following concentration levels:
FLC Kappa
Interferants Concentration Level
Conjugated Bilirubin 66.6 mg/dL
Unconjugated Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Total Protein* 150 g/L
Hemoglobin 10 g/L
Triglycerides 20 g/L
Rheumatoid Factor* 2000 IU/mL
* Maximum deviation for total protein and Rheumatoid factor is 11.7% and 12.2%,
respectively.

Exogenous Interference Study
Three serum samples containing normal, medium and high analyte concentrations were
tested for the presence of exogenous interferants using FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda kits
based on the CLSI EP7-A2 and the CLSI EP07, 3rd Edition. The test samples were prepared
by supplementing interferants in the solvent (either saline or NaOH) to reach the desired
concentration of the interferant to be tested. Additionally, neat serum samples were
supplemented with the same volume of solvent, and these were considered blanks samples.
The test samples and blank samples were analyzed by one operator through one run and 10
replicates each for test and blank samples. Mean relative deviation was calculated for blank
and test sample and no significant interference (deviation < ±10%) was observed for each
tested interferant up to the following concentration levels:
Interferants Concentration Level
Melphalan 4 mg/L
Dexamethasone* 12 mg/L
Daratumumab* 1 g/L
Bortezomib 2 mg/L
Lenalidomide 4 mg/L

* Maximum deviation for FLC Kappa assay for Carfilzomib is 11.2%. Maximum
deviation for FLC Lambda assay for Dexamethasone, Daratumumab and Isatuximab is
11.3%, 10.8% and 10.9% respectively.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay reportable range for the FLC Kappa and the FLC Lambda is the same as the
analytical measuring range for these two assays:
FLC Kappa: 4.5 – 76.2 mg/L
FLC Lambda: 3.8 – 66.8 mg/L

Traceability
In the absence of an international reference standard, the calibration of the FLC Kappa and the
FLC Lambda assays is traceable to an internally assigned master material.
Stability
Reagent Kit
a. Shelf-life stability: The real-time shelf-life stability of the FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda
reagent kits was determined over a 10-month period using three reagent lots of each
assay. Each reagent lot stored at 2–8oC was tested at 0 (T ), 1, 2, 3 6, 9 and 10 months. At
0
each testing point, three serum samples (low, medium and high concentration) as well as
two controls (FLC Control Level 1 and FLC Control Level 2) were tested in triplicate
using all three reagent lots of FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda, respectively. At each time
point, the mean concentrations for Kappa and Lambda were compared to the initial target
range concentration obtained at T . The results are acceptable at all tested time points and
0
hence support the shelf-life of FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda for 9 months at 2–8oC.
b. Open-vial stability: The open-vial (in-use) kit stability of the FLC Kappa and FLC
Lambda reagent kits was determined over a 5-week period using two reagent lots. Each
reagent lot after first opening was stored at room temperature (22oC ± 3oC) and was
tested each week for five weeks (weeks 1–5). At each testing point, three serum samples
(low, medium, and high concentration) were tested in triplicate on two reagent lots of
FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda, respectively. The results are acceptable at all tested time
points and hence support the claimed in-use stability of the FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda
up to 4 weeks at room temperature (22oC ± 3oC) after the first opening.
FLC Controls
a. Shelf-life stability: The real-time stability of the FLC Control Level 1 and FLC Control
Level 2 was determined over a 24-month period using three reagent lots. Each freeze-
dried control stored at 2–8oC was tested at 0 (T ), 4, 8, 12, and 24 months. At each testing
0
point, FLC Control Level 1 and FLC Control Level 2 were tested in triplicate using three
reagent lots of FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda, respectively. At each time point, the mean
concentrations for Kappa and Lambda were compared to the initial target range
concentration obtained at the zero-month (T ) time point. The results were acceptable at
0
all tested time points and hence support the claimed shelf-life stability of the FLC Control
Level 1 and FLC Control Level 2 up to 12 months at 2–8oC.
b. In-use (reconstituted) stability: The stability of reconstituted FLC Control Level 1 and
FLC Control Level 2 were tested for the following storage conditions: -18oC to -30oC, 2–
8oC, and room temperature (22oC ± 3oC). The stability of freeze-thaw cycles for the
Controls (freezing at -18oC to -30oC, thawing at room temperature) was also tested. For
each test condition, three lots of the Controls were tested. At each time point post first
reconstitution, the mean concentrations for the FLC Controls were compared to the initial
target range concentration obtained when the open vials of the Controls were
reconstituted for the first time. The results support the stability claim for the Controls: 3
K210623 - Page 11 of 15

--- Page 12 ---
months at -18oC to -30oC; 4 days at 2–8oC; 24 hours (one day) at room temperature (22oC
± 3oC), and up to 40 freeze-thaw cycles.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) for the FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda was determined by testing the
blank samples. All measurements yielded no detectable value. Hence the claimed LoB for the
FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda is 0 mg/L.
The limit of detection (LoD) for the FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda assays was determined by
assaying five samples with low Kappa free light chain concentration and five samples with
low Lambda free light chain concentration. The samples were tested in two runs of four
replicates over the course of 7 days using two reagent lots yielding a total of 56 replicates per
sample for each lot. The precision profile analysis was used to calculate the LoD. Since LoD
values were lower than the calibrator 1 value, the LoD was considered as equal to the LoQ
value.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) for the FLC Kappa and FLC lambda assays was determined
by assaying five samples with low Kappa free light chain concentration and five samples
with low Lambda free light chain concentration. The samples were tested in two runs of four
replicates over the course of 7 days using two reagent lots yielding a total of 56 replicates per
sample for each lot. The LoQ was defined to be the lowest concentration level that meets the
within-laboratory imprecision of < 20% for each lot. The calculated LoQ for Kappa was
determined to be 0.8 mg/L and 1.1 mg/L for Lambda. The data for linearity supported the
lower level of measuring interval for Kappa and Lambda to be 4.5 mg/L and 3.8 mg/L,
respectively. Hence the claimed LoQ for the FLC Kappa is 4.5 mg/L and the claimed LoQ
for the FLC Lambda is 3.8 mg/L.

D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The reference interval for the FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda was determined by testing the values
for Kappa FLC concentration, Lambda FLC concentration, and [Kappa FLC] / [Lambda FLC]
ratio on 238 apparently healthy adults using one reagent lot of the FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda,
respectively. The reference interval for FLC Kappa & FLC Lambda assays were defined as 95%
of the dataset. The results are summarized as follows:
Mean 95% Reference Range
FLC Kappa 10.9 mg/L 6.4 – 17.4 mg/L
FLC Lambda 13.4 mg/L 8.4 – 21.8 mg/L
Kappa/Lambda Ratio 0.83 0.46 – 1.51
