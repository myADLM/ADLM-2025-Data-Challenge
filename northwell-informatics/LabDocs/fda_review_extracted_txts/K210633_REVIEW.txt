III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Amylase2 assay is used for the quantitation of amylase in human serum, plasma, or urine
on the ARCHITECT c System.
The Amylase2 assay is to be used primarily as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of
pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
ARCHITECT c8000 clinical chemistry analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Amylase2 assay is comprised of a reagent kit that is run on the ARCHITECT c System.
Each kit has two reagents: R1 and R2. R1 contains α-glucosidase 16.000 KU/L. R2 contains
Ethylidene-4-NP-G7 (EPS) 6.501 g/L, both R1and R2 have sodium azide as preservative.
The Amylase2 assay is calibrated by the user using one of two methods:
• Calibration method, using the Consolidated Chemistry Calibrator.
• Calibration Factor method, using a fixed calibration factor value (4412) to calculate
result
There are separate assay parameter files that the user must upload for use with each of the
calibration methods. The Instructions for Use (IFU) provides information on calibration set up
for the two methods.
B Principle of Operation:
The Amylase2 assay is a two-part reaction. Ethylidene-4-NP-G7 (EPS) is hydrolyzed by α-
amylase to form 4,6- ethylidene-α-(1,4)-D-glucopyranosyl-Gx and 4-nitrophenyl-α-(1,4)-
glucopyranosyl-G(7-x). The 4-nitrophenyl-α-(1,4)-glucopyranosyl-G(7-x) is then hydrolyzed
into glucose monomers and the assay chromophore (4-nitrophenol) by α-glucosidase. The
resulting change in absorbance at 404 nm is proportional to the α-amylase concentration in the
sample.

Auto Dilution study:
The sponsor conducted a study to validate the auto-dilute feature available for both serum
and urine extended range. Five human serum samples were prepared by spiking α-amylase
stock solution into a serum pool to obtain the target concentration values of 3800, 4500,
5200, 5900, and 6600 U/L. Five urine samples were prepared by spiking α-amylase stock
solution into a urine pool to obtain the target concentration values of 3800, 4500, 5200, 5900,
and 6600 U/L. Three runs were performed, each sample was tested in replicates of five on
two instruments for a total of 30 replicates. The percent dilution recovery (% Dilution
Recovery) relative to the assigned sample concentration was calculated for the automated
dilution with calibration method and calibration factor method. Results of this study
supported the sponsor’s claim that samples with amylase concentrations above 3010 U/L can
be auto diluted 1:2 (i.e. 1:1.98) to obtain results up to 5959 U/L for serum and auto diluted
1:3 (i.e. 1:2.86) to obtain results up to 8600 U/L for urine.
Manual Dilution study:
The sponsor conducted a study to validate the manual-dilution available for both serum and
urine extended range. For serum, three sets of manually diluted samples (1:2 dilution with
saline) were prepared for each sample by two technicians. Each sample was tested in
replicates of five on one instrument for a total of 30 replicates. The percent dilution recovery
(% Dilution Recovery) relative to the assigned sample concentration was calculated for the
manual dilution with calibration method and calibration factor method. Results of this study
supported the sponsor’s claim that samples with amylase concentrations above 3010 U/L can
be diluted manually 1:2 to obtain results up to 5959 U/L for serum and diluted manually 1:3
to obtain results up to 8600 U/L for urine.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP07-A3 guideline.
Serum:
Studies were conducted using two samples with amylase concentration of 50 U/L and 200
U/L. Each sample had one aliquot for test sample and one for reference sample. Samples
were run in 10 replicates on one reagent lot, one instrument. The difference between the
mean concentration of the test and reference samples was calculated and the % difference
was calculated. The sponsor defined Amylase2 interference if the two-sided 95% confidence
interval (CI) values around the % difference was within or equal to ± 10%. The results for the
Calibration Factor method were generated using the absorbance data from the Calibrator
method, two-sided 95% CI around the % difference for amylase samples targeted at 50 U/L
and 200 U/L. The results for Calibration factor method ranged from -10% to 5% and
calibration method from -10% to 6%. The following table lists the concentrations of each
substance at which no significant interference was found:

and 1400 U/L. Each sample had two aliquots and tested for the test sample (spiked with
potentially interfering substances) and for the reference sample. Samples were run in 10
replicates, 1 reagent lot, 1 instrument. The difference between the mean concentration of the
test and reference samples and the % difference was calculated for calibration method and
calibration factor method. The sponsor defined Amylase2 interference if the two-sided 95%
Confidence Interval (CI) values around the % difference was within or equal to ± 10%, at the
target amylase levels of 450 U/L and 1400 U/L. The results for the Calibration Factor method
were generated using the absorbance data from the Calibrator method. Two-sided 95% CI
around the % difference for amylase samples ranged from -1% to 1% for both calibration
method and calibration factor method.

6. Detection Limit:
Detection capability studies of the Amylase 2 assay on the ARCHITECT c8000 with serum
and urine for limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ)
was conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.Data analysis was
conducted using both the calibration method and calibration factor method.
LoB
The 95th percentile of the zero-analyte sample concentrations based on n ≥ 60 replicates
using each of three lots of reagent and two instruments was calculated and considered the
estimated LoB.
LoD
The LoD was determined parametrically using the lowest concentration at which the analyte
could be detected with 95% probability based on n ≥ 60 replicates of low-analyte level
samples tested using each of three lots of reagent and two instruments.
LoQ
The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which a maximum allowable precision
of 20 %CV was met and was determined from n ≥ 60 replicates of low-analyte level samples
using each of three lots of reagent and two instruments.
The results of the detection limit studies are presented in the table below:
Matrix LoB LoD LoQ Analytical Measuring Interval
Serum 0 U/L 1 U/L 2 U/L 3-3010 U/L
Urine 0 U/L 1 U/L 3 U/L 3-3010 U/L

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted by testing 124 serum samples and 103 urine
samples. Two of 124 of serum samples and seven of 103 of urine samples were spiked with
amylase stock solution. For the candidate device, samples were tested using three lots of
reagents and one lot each of calibrator and controls on two ARCHITECT c8000 instruments.
For the predicate device, samples were tested using one lot each of reagents, calibrator, and
controls on two ARCHITECT c8000 instruments. Each sample was tested in duplicate using
both methods and testing occurred over three days. A Passing-Bablok evaluation was
performed by comparing the first replicate result from the candidate device versus the mean
result from the predicate device. The results are summarized below:

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed to evaluate the suitability of other blood specimen
types for use with the Amylase2 assay. A total of 65 samples were tested using one lot of the
Amylase2 reagent, one lot of the Consolidated Chemistry Calibrator, one lot of commercially
available controls, and one instrument in triplicate. The first replica result of the test tube
type was used for comparison to the mean of the replica for the control tube type (serum).
The results are shown below:

The study results support the sponsor’s claim that serum separator tube, lithium heparin,
lithium heparin serum separator tube and sodium heparin tube are acceptable collection
methods for serum and plasma samples to be used with this assay.
