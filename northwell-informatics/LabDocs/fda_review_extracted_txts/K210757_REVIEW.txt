III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
ETEST is a manual, quantitative technique for the determination of antimicrobial susceptibility
of non fastidious Gram negative and Gram positive aerobic bacteria and fastidious bacteria. The
system comprises a predefined antibiotic gradient which is used to determine the Minimum
Inhibitory Concentration (MIC, in μg/mL) of different antimicrobial agents against
microorganisms tested on agar media after overnight incubation.
Fosfomycin has been shown to be active against the Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic
microorganisms listed below according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial agent.
ETEST Fosfomycin can be used to determine the MIC of Fosfomycin against the following
microorganisms:
Active both in vitro and in clinical infections:
•Escherichia coli
•Enterococcus faecalis
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Manual reading only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
ETEST is a thin, inert and non-porous plastic strip carrying the MIC reading scale in μg/mL on
one side and a predefined antibiotic gradient on the other side.
The ETEST gradient technology is based on a combination of the concepts of dilution
and diffusion principles for susceptibility testing.
The ETEST consists of a thin, inert, nonporous plastic strip that is used to determine the
antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria. One side of the strip carries the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) reading scale expressed in μg/mL. The other side of the
strip contains a predefined continuous exponential gradient of antibiotic concentrations.
ETEST Fosfomycin contains a range of Fosfomycin from 0.032 to 512 μg/mL.
K210757 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
When the ETEST strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacteria growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip appears.
After incubation, the MIC value is read from the scale in terms of μg/mL at complete inhibition
of bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip. Since ETEST
generates MIC values which fall between two-fold dilutions for interpretation, the MIC value
read must be recorded to the next two-fold dilution.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was conducted at three sites using 5 Gram-negative and 5 Gram-
positive isolates. Each isolate was tested in triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data
points. The mode MIC value was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was
calculated based on the number of MIC values that fell within ±1 doubling dilution of the
mode. The Gram-negative reproducibility panel consisted of 5 E. coli isolates and the Gram-
positive panel consisted of 5 E. faecalis isolates. All MIC results were on scale. The testing
resulted in overall reproducibility of greater than 95%. The results were acceptable.
2. Linearity:
N/A
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
N/A
4. Assay Reportable Range:
N/A
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Inoculum Density Check. The inoculum was prepared to achieve turbidity equivalent to a
0.5 McFarland standard. Colony counts were performed periodically at each site for all QC
replicates, from at least one replicate of each reproducibility isolate on each of the three days
of testing, and from a minimum of 10% of the clinical and challenge strains tested. One
protocol deviation was noted during the reproducibility phase of the trial. The purity result
was entered at a later date but the inoculum density check information was not recovered or
recorded. This missing value was accepted.
The inoculum densities were acceptable.
Purity Check. Verification of isolate purity was conducted on all clinical, challenge and
reproducibility organism suspensions for each ETEST and from each growth control well of
the agar dilution reference panel. Only results from pure suspensions were evaluated.
Growth or Device Failure. No device failures occurred in the ETEST Fosfomycin (FO)
(0.032-512 µg/mL) clinical trial.
Quality Control Testing. The CLSI recommended QC strains (E. coli ATCC 25922, E.
faecalis ATCC 29212, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and S. aureus ATCC 29213) were tested
at least 20 times per site at three sites using both ETEST and agar dilution reference methods.
The results are summarized in Table 2.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Results obtained with ETEST Fosfomycin were compared to results obtained with the CLSI
agar dilution reference panel. The reference panel, prepared and interpreted according to
recommendations outlined in the CLSI document M07 11th ed., contained two-fold serial
dilutions of Fosfomycin with a concentration range of 0.064 – 512 μg/mL. At the end of
incubation, the MIC value obtained from the ETEST (where the complete inhibition of
growth intersects the strip) was compared to MIC results obtained with the reference method.
The testing conditions for ETEST consisted of the following:
• Inoculum: Direct colony suspension to achieve a suspension equivalent to a 0.5
McFarland standard suspension
• Medium: Cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton agar
• Incubation: 35° C ± 2 for 16-20 hours
Clinical testing was performed at three external sites with both ETEST Fosfomycin and the
reference method. A total of 353 clinical isolates were evaluated including 201 E. coli, and
152 E. faecalis. The clinical testing included 57.2% fresh (isolated no longer than 6 months
prior to testing) and 42.8% stock strains (isolated over 6 months prior to testing) clinical
isolates. A total of 76 challenge isolates were also evaluated at a single site including 37 E.
coli, and 39 E. faecalis.

Essential agreement (EA) is when the ETEST Fosfomycin results agree exactly or within one
doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the ETEST
Fosfomycin result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
For clinical and challenge isolates tested with the ETEST Fosfomycin, the combined
clinical and challenge %EA and %CA met the acceptance criteria of greater than or
equal to 90% (Table 4) for each organism group.
Testing/Reporting MICs for Non-Indicated Species
For this review, the interpretative criteria are applied to the organisms/organism groups
according to the FDA STIC website. As required under 511A(2)(2)(B) of the Federal Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act, the following statements are added in the package insert:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the
safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial
susceptibility is tested by this AST device, may or may not have been
established in adequate and well- controlled clinical trials for treating clinical
infections due to microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and
usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information
in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for specific
antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.
Inoculator and ETEST Strip Applicator Options:
Culture media plates for ETEST can be inoculated and streaked by swabs manually or with
the RETRO C80 inoculator. ETEST strips can be applied onto inoculated media using
forceps or the NEMA C88 vacuum pen.

The ETEST studies for Fosfomycin used manual inoculation with swabs and applied
ETEST strips with forceps and the Vacuum Pen NEMA C88 at all test sites. The following
statement is included as a footnote to the performance table in the device labeling:
The optional Inoculator RETRO C80 and Applicator SIMPLEX C76 can be used to
inoculate plates and apply ETEST strips to agar media. In the ETEST Fosfomycin clinical
studies, swabs were used for plate inoculation/streaking, and forceps and the Vacuum Pen
NEMA C88 were used for ETEST strip application.
MIC Trends:
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data.
This trending calculation considers MIC values that are determined to be one or more
doubling dilutions lower or higher compared to the reference method irrespective of
whether the device MIC values are on-scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least one
dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference
method are not considered in the trending analysis.
Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs. lower
MIC reading was ≥ 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined to be
statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that
provides higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in labeling.
A trend toward lower MIC readings was observed for E. coli when compared to the CLSI
agar dilution reference method, as summarized in Table 5. The following statement is
included as a footnote to the performance table in the device labeling to address the
observed trending:
“ETEST Fosfomycin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one doubling
dilution lower when testing Escherichia coli compared to the reference agar dilution
method.”

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the BioMerieux ETEST Fosfomycin (FO) (0.032-512 µg/mL) when
revised breakpoints for Fosfomycin are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint
change protocol included with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met,
BioMerieux will update the Fosfomycin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an
updated performance section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the
new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
