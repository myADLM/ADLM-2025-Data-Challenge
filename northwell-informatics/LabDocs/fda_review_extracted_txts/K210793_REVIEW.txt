B Principle of Operation:
The assay principle combines a one-step sandwich enzyme immunoassay method with a final
fluorescence detection, also known as enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (ELFA). The sample is
transferred into the well containing anti‑IGFBP‑7 and anti-TIMP‑2 antibodies labeled with
alkaline phosphatase (conjugate). The sample/conjugate mixture is cycled in and out of the Solid
Phase Receptacle (SPR) device several times. This operation enables the two proteins to bind
with the immunoglobulins that are fixed to the interior wall of the SPR device and to the
conjugate to form a sandwich. Unbound components are eliminated during washing steps. Two
detection steps are carried out successively. During each detection step, the substrate
(4‑Methyl‑umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR device. The conjugate enzyme
catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone), the
fluorescence of which is measured at 450 nm. For each protein, the intensity of the fluorescence
is proportional to the concentration in the sample. At the end of the assay, the protein
concentrations are calculated by the VIDAS® 3 instrument in relation to the two calibration
curves, one corresponding to each protein, and encoded in the MLE (Master Lot Entry) data. The
concentration from each protein, TIMP‑2 and IGFBP‑7, is converted into a single numerical
result called the AKIRISK Score. The VIDAS® NEPHROCHECK® Test result, known as the
AKIRISK Score, is automatically calculated by the instrument as the product of the
concentrations of the two biomarkers, in ng/mL, divided by 1000, according to the following
formula:
AKIRISK Score = (TIMP‑2 x IGFBP‑7)/1000

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The device precision was evaluated using a 20-day precision study conducted at 3 clinical
laboratories according to CLSI guideline EP05-A3 using 7 pooled native urine samples that
included samples below the AKIRISK Score cutoff (Samples S1, S2, and S3), and samples to
span the range of the AKIRISK Score (Samples S4, S5, S6, and S7). All samples were tested
in duplicate, 2 times per day, for 20 days with a single reagent lot and a single instrument at
each site. Each sample was measured 80 times at each site, for a total of 240 measurements
per sample. The sponsor assessed Within-Run, Between-Run, Between-Day, and Total
Imprecision (Between Site/Instrument/Lot variation).
The sponsor provided information to support the expected imprecision of the individual
analytes used in the calculation of the AKIRISK score.

A second study was also performed (8 samples, 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day, 8 days
per lot, 3 lots) that demonstrated that lot-to-lot variation was not a significant contributor to
assay imprecision.

2. Linearity:
The reportable range of the AKIRISK Score is 0.04 – 10.0. The component measurements of
the AKIRISK score (IGFBP-7 and TIMP-2 measurements) were assessed and found to be
linear across the reportable range of the AKIRISK Score. However, the AKIRISK Score
itself is not expected to be linear.
Low concentration urine was spike with purified recombinant proteins to measure the hook
effect at AKIRISK scores approaching 1000. No high dose hook effect was observed for the
AKIRISK Score at these values.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP07-Ed3 using pooled human
urine samples. Interferents were selected from medications, contrast agents, plasma
expanders, other urine constituents, isoforms of TIMP and IGFBP, and other biomarkers
which have been reported as elevated in the literature in AKI. The sponsor performed testing
with substances identified as potentially interfering with IGFBP-7 and TIMP-2.
Concentrations were selected based on guidelines in CLSI EP37, expected values for this
patient population identified from literature references or concentrations previously tested for
similar devices. Two lots of the VIDAS NEPHROCHECK assay were tested using 8 VIDAS
3 instruments. A sample with a high AKIRISK Score, as well as a sample close to the clinical
cutoff were used. Interference was defined as any interferents that exhibited greater than
±10% interference in the AKIRISK Score test result.
% observed interference = [Mean Assay Result (Test Pool) - Mean Assay Result (Control Pool)]
Mean Assay Result (Control Pool) x 100
If interference was observed at the highest concentration, the effect of the interference was
characterized by a dose-response experiment to determine the degree of interference as a
function of the interfering substance concentration.

* The sponsor claims no interference from phosphate up to 1,100 mg/L in their labeling despite
testing a higher concentration.
Due to the potential of hemoglobin to interfere with results, urine samples with AKIRISK
Scores between 0.30 and 0.46 should also be tested with a urine dipstick test for the
presence of hematuria. If the blood result is high positive (3+) or the urine sample has some
indications of blood in the urine (e.g., pink/red color), the AKIRISK Score may be falsely
elevated, and should not be used. Hemoglobin levels above 60 mg/L can lead to a 20%
increase in the AKIRISK™ Score.
The effect of pH on AKIRISK Scores around and above the cutoff using samples with
AKIRISK Score of 0.3 and 5.0 were evaluated. Pooled human urine samples targeting these
AKIRISK Scores were adjusted to target pH values of approximately 4, 6, 8, and 10. There
was no significant interference detected at any tested pH level.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The analytical measuring interval was determined in the linearity and detection limit studies,
which support the analytical measuring interval for AKIRISK Score as 0.04 – 10,
corresponding to the AKIRISK Score calculation with the two lower limits and the two upper
limits of the protein ranges.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Metrological Traceability:
The IGFBP-7 and TIMP-2 values obtained with the VIDAS NEPHROCHECK assay were
assigned to be traceable to the commercially available predicate device.
Sample Stability:
Sample stability studies were reviewed and found acceptable. Urine samples should be
centrifuged within 1 hour of collection. The results support the storage of centrifuged
samples for up to 5 hours at 18-25°C in plastic tubes with no additives, or in Low Protein

Binding tubes for up to 5 hours at 18-25°C, 24 hours at 2-8°C, and 6 months at ≤ 60°C (with
up to two freeze-thaw cycles).
6. Detection Limit:
Detection limit studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. Three lots of the
assay and 1 instrument were used in the studies. One calibration was performed for each lot
of the assay.
1. Limit of blank (LoB):
The LoB of each protein was determine using 4 urine samples, tested in duplicate in a single
run per day for 8 days, corresponding to 64 values for each of the blank samples.
2. Limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ):
The LoD and LoQ of IGFBP-7 were determined using 4 individual urine samples obtained
from individual healthy donors. The LoD and LoQ of TIMP-2 were determined using 5
individual urine samples obtained from individual healthy donors. Low-level samples were
tested in five replicates in a single run per day for 8 days, corresponding to 40 values per
sample. The LoD was determined for each lot and each protein consistent with the classical
approach described in CLSI EP17-A2. The final LoD for each protein was defined as the
maximum LoD value obtained for any of the lots. The final LoD for the VIDAS
NEPHROCHECK assay was defined as the AKIRISK Score calculated with the LoD defined
for the two proteins by applying the Score formula.
The classical approach described in the CLSI EP17-A2 was used to determine the LoQ. For
each lot and each protein the LoQ was defined as 20% total within-lot precision. The final
LoQ for each protein was defined as the maximum LoQ value obtained for any of the lots.
The final LoQ for the VIDAS NEPHROCHECK assay was defined as the AKIRISK Score
calculated with the LoQ defined for the two proteins by applying the Score formula.
The results are presented below.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay cut-off is an AKIRISK score of 0.3. This single cut-off value is based on the package
insert of the predicate device, as well as the literature, and was validated in the clinical study.

C Clinical Studies:
The sponsor conducted a retrospective, multi-center clinical study. Sample sets previously
collected in the US from two distinct cohorts were used: A) a sample subset of 400 banked
human urine samples from Study A (called Cohort A, or Topaz cohort), and B) a sample set of
126 banked urine samples from Study B (called Cohort B, or Opal cohort). The complete Cohort
A and Cohort B were previously evaluated in the predicate’s clinical study DEN130031. The
subjects in the study were 21 years or older and were ICU patients with respiratory and/or
cardiovascular compromise. AKI status for each subject was determined by clinical diagnosis
established through independent central adjudication. The Cohort A subset included 69 AKI-
positive and 331 non-AKI patients (one of which was excluded due to sample turbidity, resulting
in 330 non-AKI patients). The samples available for evaluation were representative of the overall
cohort. Cohort B included 29 AKI-positive patients and 97 non-AKI patients. The banked
samples were tested at 4 testing sites.
Four lots of the assay were used at each site and 2 calibration cycles per lot were performed.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A reference range study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP28-A3. Banked urine
samples from apparently healthy US subjects (378) and US subjects with stable chronic
morbidities (372), were tested at 3 sites. Three assay lots were used per site and 2 calibration
cycles per lot were performed. The overall reference interval for apparently healthy subjects was
<0.04 to 2.50 and for subjects with stable chronic morbidities was <0.04 to 2.66. The reference
intervals were comparable for apparently healthy subjects and subjects with stable chronic
morbidities, and for males and females from the two cohorts. A breakdown by sex is shown
below.
