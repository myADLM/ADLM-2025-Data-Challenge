B Indication(s) for Use:
For in vitro diagnostic and laboratory professional use.
VITROS Chemistry Products PHBR Slides quantitatively measure phenobarbital (PHBR)
concentration in serum and plasma (lithium heparin) using the automated VITROS 5600
Integrated System.
Measurements obtained by this device are used as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of
phenobarbital use or overdose and in monitoring levels of phenobarbital to help ensure
appropriate therapy.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Automated VITROS 5600 Integrated System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITROS PHBR Slide is a multilayered, analytical element coated on a polyester support.
The phenobarbital assay is based on an enzymatic heterogeneous, competitive immunoassay
format. Immobilized anti-phenobarbital antibody and phenobarbital-peroxidase conjugate are
present in the spreading layer.
B Principle of Operation:
The determination of Phenobarbital concentrations is performed using the VITROS Chemistry
Products PHBR Slides in conjunction with the VITROS Chemistry Products Calibrator Kit 9 on
the VITROS 5600 Integrated System.
The phenobarbital assay is based on an enzymatic heterogeneous, competitive immunoassay
format. Immobilized anti-phenobarbital antibody and phenobarbital-peroxidase conjugate are
present in the spreading layer. Phenobarbital in the sample competes with the phenobarbital-
peroxidase conjugate for a limited number of antibody binding sites. The subsequent addition of
the VITROS Immuno-Wash Fluid to the slide removes unbound phenobarbital-peroxidase
conjugate from the read area, while also providing a substrate for the enzyme mediated oxidation
of leuco dye. The rate of dye formation, as monitored by reflectance spectrophotometry, is
inversely proportional to the phenobarbital concentration in the sample.

was evaluated internally, on the VITROS 5600 Integrated System, with three VITROS
Chemistry Systems PHBR Slides reagent lots. Three serum based controls and 4 serum
samples spanning the analytical measuring interval were evaluated for performance. Each
precision sample was assayed in replicates of two, 2 runs per day for 22 days for a total of 88
replicates per sample for each lot.
The results of the precision studies are shown in the table below:

2. Linearity:
Linearity studies were performed according to CLSI EP06-A guideline. A series of fourteen
proportionally related admixtures of low and high concentration samples were tested in
duplicates. The sample concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 83.5 µg/mL. The results of the
linearity studies support that the assay is linear over the claimed measuring range of 3.0 –
80.0 μg/mL.
Sample Dilution Studies:
Serum and plasma samples with values greater than 80.0 μg/mL may be diluted with one part
sample and one part diluent. Dilution studies were performed to determine the sample
recovery after a 1:2 dilution is performed automatically by the VITROS 5600 Integrated
System. A total of 12 serum and 12 plasma (lithium heparin) samples with phenobarbital
concentrations between 80.0 to 160.0 μg/mL were diluted 1:2 on-analyzer using the VITROS
Chemistry Products Specialty Diluent and run in triplicate. The average percent differences
for the diluted sample versus the expected concentration was within 10%. The dilution study

results support the sponsor’s labeling claims that samples with phenobarbital concentrations
above the 80.0 μg/mL may be diluted 1:2 on- analyzer to obtain results up to 160.0 μg/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The VITROS Chemistry Products PHBR Slides method was screened for interfering
substances at phenobarbital concentrations of approximately 15 and 50 μg/mL following
CLSI EP07 and EP37 guidelines. Each test and control sample were run in replicates of 6 on
3 reagent lots. The sponsor defined significant interference as a bias > 1.8 μg/mL at a
phenobarbital concentration of approximately 15 μg/mL or a bias > 5.2 μg/mL at a
phenobarbital concentration of approximately 50 μg/mL.

spiked with low phenobarbital concentrations for 5 days. The LoQ testing consisted of 15
replicates of four low phenobarbital concentration serum sample pools for 3 days. The LoQ
was defined as the highest phenobarbital concentration having a total allowable error of ≤1.5
µg/mL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were conducted by testing 142 serum samples using the VITROS
Chemistry Products PHBR Slides (candidate device) and the ARCHITECT iPhenobarbital
Assay (predicate device). The phenobarbital concentrations in the samples ranged from 5.59
to >80 µg/mL, as determined by the predicate device. Passing-Bablok regression analysis
was performed to determine the correlation.
Regression Analysis Summary table is shown below:

2. Matrix Comparison:
Matrix comparison testing followed recommendations per CLSI EP35 guideline. A total of
fifty-four matched samples were tested, which included fifty-one native samples and three
samples that were spiked with phenobarbital to create high concentration samples. The
following matrices were evaluated: serum (reference matrix), lithium heparin plasma, serum
drawn using a serum separator tube (SST), and lithium heparin plasma drawn using a plasma
separator tube (PST). Samples from each matrix were tested in duplicate using three reagent
lots on one VITROS 5600 Integrated System.
