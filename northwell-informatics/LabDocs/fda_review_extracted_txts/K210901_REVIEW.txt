albumin 25 g/L; preservative.
Biotinylated 25‑hydroxyvitamin D 20 μg/L; bis‑tris propane buffer 200 mmol/L;
preservative.
Streptavidin-coated microparticles: Streptavidin-coated microparticles 0.72 mg/mL and
preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
Elecsys Vitamin D total III assay is a back titration immunoassay, comprising several discrete
steps: pretreatment step to release 25-OH vitamin D bound to vitamin D binding protein;
incubation of pretreated sample with ruthenium tris-bipyridine labeled vitamin D binding
protein; and second incubation of sample with streptavidin-coated microparticles and
biotinylated 25-OH vitamin D labeled to bind any unbound ruthenium tris-bipyridine labeled
vitamin D binding protein. The sample is drawn into the analyzer’s electrochemiluminescence
(ECL) detection module, and the ECL signal generated is inversely proportional to amount of
25-OH vitamin D in the sample.

a high analyte serum sample of known concentration with a depleted low analyte serum
sample, and covering a range of 1.67 to 133 ng/mL. Each sample was assayed in triplicate
using one lot and one instrument. The mean of the observed results were compared by
regression analysis to the expected results based on the dilution volumes. Regression analysis
identified that the coefficients for polynomial fit were statistically significant, and therefore
the polynomial better than the linear model. Further analysis found that the deviation from
linearity at each concentration (i.e. difference between polynomial and linear fit) to be
insignificant as defined by the sponsor with absolute bias less than ±2 ng/mL and percent
bias less then ±10%. Based on these results, the sponsor concluded that the test system
demonstrated a proportional response over the claimed measuring range of 6 – 120 ng/mL.
Sample Dilution study
A sample dilution study was conducted to support the claim in the product labeling that 25-
OH vitamin D samples with results above the measuring range may be manually diluted with
the sponsor’s Diluent Universal or serum with a low analyte concentration. In the study, four
samples were spiked with 25-OH vitamin D to prepare concentrations with expected values
ranging from 125 - 183 ng/mL. Each of the four samples were diluted 1:2 with Universal
Diluent, and diluted 1:2 with analyte depleted serum. Each diluted sample was assayed in
triplicate, and analyzed for recovery after correcting for dilution. The recoveries ranged from
95% to 109%. The dilution study results support the sponsor’s labeling claims that samples
with 25-OH vitamin D concentrations above 120 ng/mL may be manually diluted 1:2 to
obtain results up to 240 ng/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity performance of the Elecsys Vitamin D total III assay on the cobas e
601 analyzer was established by conducting a cross-reactivity study and interference testing
for endogenous and exogenous substances.
Endogenous
Interference from certain endogenous substances was assessed using three serum samples
with 25-OH Vitamin D concentrations of low, mid, and high. Each of the three samples was
further divided into two aliquots for a control sample (with no added interferent) and test
sample (with added interferent). For each of the three original serum samples, the control and
test samples were further prepared into a series of 11 samples of varying substance
concentration by inter-mixing the control and test samples with known volumes. Each
sample of the dilution series was assayed in five replicates using one lot and one instrument.
From measurement of the dilution series for the three original serum samples of low, mid,
and high 25-OH Vitamin D concentration, the highest substances concentration within the
allowable error was found, and identified as the highest concentration at which no significant
interference is observed. The sponsor defined the allowable error as:
LoQ to 20.0 ng/mL: ≤ 2.5 ng/mL
>20.0 ng/mL to 50 ng/mL: ≤ 10%
>50.0 ng/mL: ≤ 15%
K210901 - Page 5 of 11

The results of the study are summarized as follows:
Highest concentration tested at which
Substance
no significant interference is observed
Albumin 7 g/dL
Bilirubin 66 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 600 mg/dL
Intralipid 300 mg/dL
IgG 7 g/dL
IgA 1.3 g/dL
IgM 1 g/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 1200 IU/mL
Triglyceride 300 mg/dL
Biotin Interference
Biotin interference was tested with three serum samples containing 25-OH Vitamin D
concentrations of 10, 28, and 77 ng/mL. Each of the three samples were spiked at two levels
of biotin at 1550 and 3600 ng/mL, along with controls samples with no added biotin. For
each of the serum samples, the control and test samples were further prepared into a series of
11 samples of varying substance concentration by inter-mixing the control and test samples
with known volumes. Each sample of the dilution series was assayed in five replicates using
one lot and one instrument. From measurement of the dilution series for the serum samples
of low, mid, and high 25-OH Vitamin D concentration, the highest biotin concentration
within the allowable error of ±10% was found. The results of the study support the labeling
claim that specimens containing biotin up to a concentration of 600 ng/mL demonstrated ≤
10% change in 25‑hydroxyvitamin D assay results.

Cross-reactivity
A cross-reactivity study was conducted to quantify the level of cross-reactivity from certain
vitamin D metabolites with the assay. In the study, three test samples were prepared by
spiking individually various vitamin D metabolites into native human serum samples with
approximate 25-OH vitamin D concentrations of 20, 40, and 60 ng/mL. The concentrations
of the cross-reactants were chosen to ensure results within the measuring range depending on
their expected cross-reactivity and to reflect at least >10 times higher concentration as
typically found in native serum. These samples were paired with three reference samples of
the same serum that were not spiked and with the same 25-OH vitamin D concentrations.
Each sample was assayed in replicates of five using one lot and one instrument. The results
from each of the three test samples and reference samples were averaged. The difference in
results between test and reference samples was calculated for each of the three 25-OH
vitamin D concentrations, and each analyzed for %cross-reactivity using the below equation.
The table summarizes the cross-reactivities from the study as the mean of the three results.
The product labeling lists %cross-reactivity and %cross-reactivity normalized to the 25-
hydroxyvitamin D3 %cross-reactivity.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison:
The accuracy performance of the Elecsys Vitamin D total III assay on the cobas e 601
analyzer was established by a method comparison against a reference method for vitamin D.
In the study, 157 native, single donor patient serum samples were tested in singlicate on the
candidate device and the reference method. The samples were CDC Verification Samples
provided by the Vitamin D Standardization and Certification Program with assigned values
by the candidate Reference Method Procedure: ID-LCMS/MS at the CDC Vitamin D
Reference Laboratory. The results of the study were analyzed graphically for slope and
intercept by Deming regression analysis, and summarized as follows:
Concentration range,
Regression equation r

5.6 to 118.4 ng/mL y = 0.981x + 0.795 0.982
The predicted bias at medical decision point (30 ng/mL) was calculated as the percent
difference between the Deming regression line and the unity line at the medical decision
point and was found to be 0.8%.
2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix equivalency study to serum was conducted to support use of the Elecsys Vitamin D
total III assay on the cobas e 601 analyzer with additional specimen matrix types claimed in
the product labeling: Serum Separation Tubes, and Li-Heparin plasma, K2-EDTA plasma,
and K3-EDTA plasma. In the study, 46 donor matched venous specimens of the
aforementioned were collected. Each specimen was tested in singlicate using one lot of the
reagent kit and one instrument, and the results compared to the mean of singlicate serum

concentration from the first replicate of each donor’s evaluation tube (y-axis) versus the
mean concentration of the serum results (x-axis). The slope and intercept of the regression
line were calculated, and summarized as follows:
Specimen Range r Intercept Slope
Li-Heparin plasma 8.28 to 103 ng/mL 0.985 -0.62 1.03
K2-EDTA plasma 9.27 to 99.8 ng/mL 0.957 0.072 0.973
K3-EDTA plasma 9.32 to 100 ng/mL 0.990 0.14 0.92
Serum Separation Tube 8.88 to 107 ng/mL 0.987 -0.26 1.02
The study results support the sponsor’s claim that human serum and plasma (lithium heparin,
K2-EDTA and K3 EDTA) are acceptable sample types to be used with this assay.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A reference range study with Elecsys Vitamin D total III assay on the cobas e 601 analyzer was
conducted testing serum samples collected from apparently healthy donors from southern,
middle, and northern sites of the United States during both summer and winter. There were
approximately equal numbers of males and females, and approximately 30% of the donors had
dark skin complexion. The age range was 22 to 79 years. The results of the study are
summarized as follows:
Seasonal
All (n = 463) Summer (n = 245) Winter (n = 218)
Mean, ng/mL 26.6 29.2 23.6
Median 25.7 27.7 22.8
2.5th percentile 10.2 12.5 9.4
97.5th percentile 49.4 52.4 44.1
