B Principle of Operation:
The EliA Ro52 and the EliA Ro60 are semi-quantitative solid-phase fluoroimmunoassay for the
determination of autoantibodies against SS-A/Ro 52 kDa and 60 kDa proteins. Both assays are
fully integrated and automated system which comprises of assay-specific reagents, EliA method-
specific reagents, and general reagents.
The specific antigen (SS-A/Ro 52kDa protein or SS-A/Ro 60 kDa protein) is coated to the EliA
solid phase component (EliA Well). The EliA wells are molded cups comparable to excised
wells from a microtiter plate. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to the SS-A/Ro 52
kDa protein or SS-A/Ro 60 kDa protein bind to these specific antigens coated on the EliA well.
After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG
antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After
incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away, and the bound complex is incubated with a
Development Solution. Following a reaction period, the reaction is stopped and the fluorescence
of the reaction mixture is measured. As the extent of the fluorescent signal corresponds to the
amount of antibody of interest that is bound to the antigen coated EliA well, the higher the value
of fluorescent signal detected by the instrument, the higher the amount of antibody bound and
K210902 - Page 3 of 23

detected in the sample tested. To evaluate the test results, the fluorescence from patient samples
is directly compared to a calibrator control curve.

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the EliA Ro52 and the EliA Ro60 was evaluated based on the
recommendations of CLSI EP06-Ed2.
Three patient serum samples were serially diluted using a normal blood donor serum sample
for a total of 9 dilutions for each dilution series across. The following patient serum sample
concentrations were used: 266.1 EliA U/mL, 89.5 EliA U/mL, and 15.9 EliA U/mL were
used for EliA Ro52 testing on the Phadia 250 instrument; 275.5 EliA U/mL, 97.7 EliA
U/mL, 16.2 EliA U/mL were used for EliA Ro52 testing on the Phadia 2500E instrument;
249.4 EliA U/mL, 88.5 EliA U/mL, and 15.4 EliA U/mL were used for EliA Ro60 testing on
the Phadia 250 instrument; and 263.6 EliA U/mL, 92.3 EliA U/mL, and 12.3 EliA U/mL
were used for EliA Ro60 testing on the Phadia 2500E instrument. Each sample was then
tested in quadruplicate using one lot of EliA Ro52 Well and EliA Ro60 Well, and a single
Phadia 250 instrument or Phadia 2500E instrument, respectively. The results were analyzed
using by fitting a regression model, assuming proportionality between the observed
concentration and the expected concentration, using the weighted least squares method.

Hook Effect/Over the Range Results:
Not applicable. Results above the upper limit of the measuring range are reported as “>240”
for both assays. No recommendations are made for dilution of samples outside of the
analytical measuring range in the Directions for Use of each assay.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Comparison to Reference Sera:
CDC (Center for Disease Controls and Prevention) ANA human reference sera panel samples
#1– #12 were tested using one lot of the Ro52 and one lot of the EliA Ro60 EliA Rib-P assay
reagents.
For the EliA Ro52, CDC ANA #2 (speckled pattern in FANA), CDC ANA #7 (SS-A/Ro)
and CDC ANA #10 (Jo-1) showed positive results with 13.9 EliA U/mL, 19.5 EliA U/mL
and 247.4 EliA U/mL, respectively. CDC ANA #3 (RNP-Sm, SS-A/Ro, SS-B/La) showed an
equivocal result with 7.4 EliA U/mL. All other CDC ANA samples remained negative.
For the EliA Ro60, CDC ANA #2 (speckled pattern in FANA), CDC ANA #3 (RNP-Sm, SS-
A/Ro, SS-B/La), and CDC ANA #7 (SS-A/Ro) showed positive results with 143.0 EliA
U/mL, 146.2 EliA U/mL and 207.2 EliA U/mL, respectively. All other CDC ANA samples
remained negative.
Endogenous and Exogenous Interference:
Three serum samples: one negative sample, one sample with a concentration within the
equivocal range, and one positive sample, were spiked with the different interfering
substances or blank solution. For the EliA Ro52, the concentration of the samples were 1.0
EliA U/mL, 10.4 EliA U/mL, and 116.5 EliA U/mL. For the EliA Ro60, the concentration of
the samples were 0.5 EliA U/mL, 8.0 EliA U/mL, and 102.5 EliA U/mL. All samples were
tested in triplicate in two runs using one lot of EliA antigen specific wells and one lot of
system reagents on the Phadia 250 instrument. The quotient between serum sample spiked
with interference substance and serum sample spiked with blank was calculated for each
sample spiked with the interfering substance. No interference, the quotient between samples

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range for the EliA Ro52 is 0.7 – 240.0 EliA U/mL.
The reportable range for the EliA Ro60 is 0.5 – 240.0 EliA U/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The EliA IgG calibrators are traceable (via unbroken chain of calibrations) to the
International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum Immunoglobulins A, G
and M from WHO. New batches of IgG calibrators are compared to a secondary standard
(standardized with the IRP) or the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct
concentration.
The instrument measures specific IgG concentrations in μg/L. By using a conversion factor
given by the lot-specific code of the EliA test well, the results are automatically converted to
EliA U/mL.
Stability:
Stability (open and closed vial, and on-board) of EliA IgG method-specific reagents and
general EliA reagents were previously established through the clearance of other EliA tests,

e.g., K141375, K061165. The stability for the EliA Ro52 and the EliA Ro60 assay-specific
reagents (i.e., EliA Ro52 Wells and EliA Ro60 Wells) were determined as follows:
Shelf-life:
The stability of the EliA Ro52 Wells and the EliA Ro60 Wells was evaluated with a real-time
study on the Phadia 250 instrument. Three lots EliA Ro52 Wells were stored under standard
conditions in sealed foil bags with desiccant bags inside, at 2–8°C, and tested 0, 7, 13, 19,
and 25 months. Each lot of wells was initially tested in three identical initial runs and in two
identical test runs at the later time points. The wells were tested with four positive samples
and with nine negative samples in single determination with a full calibration curve.
The shelf-life was determined to be up to 24 months at 2–8°C for the EliA Ro52 and up to 18
months at 2–8°C for EliA Ro60.
On-board stability:
The on-board stability the EliA Ro52 Wells and the EliA Ro60 Wells was tested over 8
weeks using three positive and two negative samples on the Phadia 250 instrument. For this
study, the carriers were stored at 10°C ±20% and 80% ±20% humidity in the Phadia 250
carrier storage tray in a temperature- and humidity-test cabinet for up to 8 weeks. The
following conditions were tested: 8 weeks at 10°C and 80% humidity, 8 weeks at 2–8°C, 4
weeks at 2–8°C and 4 weeks at 10°C and 80% humidity, and 2 weeks at 2–8°C and 6 weeks
at 10°C with 80% humidity. At 12 different days during the study, the carriers were removed
from the holder, shaken three times to simulate dispensing, and were returned to the carrier
storage tray. The wells were measured together after 8 weeks, using three positive and two
negative samples, which were assayed in duplicate.
The on-board stability for the Phadia 250 was determined to be 28 days at 2–8°C.
Open (in-use) Stability:
Stability after first opening of the foil bag containing the EliA Ro52 and EliA Ro60 wells
was tested with a real-time study. In this study, EliA Ro52 and EliA Ro60 wells in the carrier
(stored at 2–8°C) were removed from the foil bag, stored 5 minutes at room temperature,
closed again by the zipper, and stored at +10°C and 80% humidity in a climate chamber until
use. This process of opening and sealing the wells in the carrier was repeated six times within
2 months. The wells were stored at +10°C and 80% humidity in a climate chamber for up to
10 months. At 0, 4, 6, and 10 months, the wells were compared to EliA Ro52 and EliA Ro 60
wells stored under standard conditions at +2 to +8°C. Each positive sample, three for EliA
Ro52 and two for EliA Ro60, were tested in triplicate. Each negative sample, two for EliA
Ro52 and one for EliA Ro60, were tested in single determinations.
The in-use stability was determined to be 6 months at 2–8°C for the EliA Ro52 and EliA
Ro60 wells.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), Limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of the EliA
Ro52 assay were determined on both Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500E.
K210902 - Page 12 of 23

--- Page 13 ---
LoB was determined from the measurement of four blank samples (analyte-free, i.e. IgG
depleted sera) tested in five replicates per sample in one run on a Phadia 250 and Phadia
2500E instrument, respectively, over three consecutive days using two different lots of test
reagents. The LoB was calculated as the 95th percentile for each lot (60 observations per lot).
The LoB was determined as the higher value of these two lots for each type of instrument.
The claimed LoB for EliA Ro52 and EliA Ro60 is the highest 95th percentile LoB value
across the two lots and instrument types.
LoD was determined by testing four low-level samples in five replicates per sample in one
run on a Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500E instrument, respectively, over three consecutive days
using two different lots of test reagents. The LoD for each lot was calculated based on 240
determinations with 120 blank and 120 low level replicates per instrument type, following
the recommendations of CLSI document EP17-A and with proportions of false positives (α)
less than 5% and false negatives (β) less than 5%. The claimed LoD for EliA Ro52 and EliA
Ro60 is the greatest LoD across the two lots and both instrument types.
LoQ was determined by testing four low-levels samples in five replicates per sample over
three consecutive days, in one run on a Phadia 250 and Phadia 2500E instrument, and two
reagent lots. The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration of measurand that meets the
predefined imprecision goal of <20% for each lot. The greatest LoQ across the two lots and
both instrument types was set as the claimed LoQ for the EliA Ro52 and EliA Ro60 assays.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay cut-off and the equivocal range for the EliA Ro52 were established by testing a
cohort consisting of 69 apparently healthy blood donors, 19 samples from SLE patients and 9
samples from SS patients on a Phadia 250 instrument. The established cut-off was further
verified for the additional intended use groups of IIM and SSc patients by testing an
additional 10 IIM and 14 SSc patient sera.
The assay cut-off and the equivocal range of the EliA Ro60 was established by testing a
cohort consisting of 70 samples from apparently healthy blood donors, 22 samples from SLE
patients and 6 samples from SS patients on a Phadia 250 instrument.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A total of 208 patient serum samples with antibody concentrations covering the measuring
range were tested with the EliA Ro52, the EliA Ro60 and their predicates, QUANTA Flash
Ro52 and QUANTA Flash Ro60 assays. The tests were performed in single determination
according to the Directions for Use for each assay. Only samples that were found within the
measuring intervals of the EliA and/or QUANTA Flash tests were used for the method
comparison analysis. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA),
and total agreement were calculated with equivocal results considered as negative or as
positive, respectively. The results are summarized in the tables below:

A total of 713 clinically and ethnically defined serum samples were used to determine the
clinical sensitivity and specificity of the EliA Ro52 assay. Samples with a diagnosis of
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (n=120) and Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) (n=60) represent
the “Target Disease”. Samples with a diagnosis of various other autoimmune and infectious
diseases are represented as the “Control Disease” group (n=390). The distribution of the
diseases and the EliA Ro52 result for each clinical subgroup is summarized in the following
table.

2. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Not applicable
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Same as assay cut-off.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The expected value in the normal population is negative. Antibody prevalence in autoimmune
patients varies widely depending on disease area. The proportion of sera from a normal
population found positive for the antinuclear antibodies covered by the EliA Ro52 and EliA
Ro60 test is below 1%. Expected values may vary depending on the population tested. A panel of
400 serum samples from apparently healthy Caucasian blood donors were collected from the
Biobank at Phadia GmbH (Germany). A supplemental set of 240 serum samples was added to
the study to reflect the ethnic composition of the U.S. The 240 supplemental serum samples
consisted of 80 African American, 80 Hispanic, and 80 Asian healthy blood donor specimens.
The distribution of samples and the test results are presented in the following tables:
