and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders, including diabetes mellitus and idiopathic
hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell tumors. The YSI 2900C Biochemistry Analyzer is not
intended for use in the screening or quantitative analysis on neonates. The YSI 2900C
Biochemistry Analyzer is not intended for point of care (POC) use.
This test is for prescription use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Not for Point-of-Care Use
D Special Instrument Requirements:
YSI 2900C Biochemistry Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The YSI 2900C Biochemistry Analyzer, is a laboratory instrument for determining glucose
concentrations in human venous whole blood (dipotassium (K2EDTA), tripotassium EDTA
(K3EDTA), sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate, lithium heparin, and sodium heparin), venous
K2EDTA plasma, fingerstick capillary K3EDTA whole blood, and serum samples. The YSI
2900C Biochemistry Analyzer is a semi-automated electronic device that incorporates fluidics
for sampling, calibrating, and flushing, contains a membrane-immobilized enzyme-coupled
electrochemical detection system, and has a graphical user interface for control of the instrument
and access to data.
The instrument contains two stations, one to accommodate plates or racks for batch sampling and
a second for manual sampling from tubes or syringes.
Assay components are provided to the customer individually and are listed below.
K210933 - Page 2 of 10

Materials Required:
• YSI 2357 Buffer Concentrate Kit
• YSI 2747 D-Glucose Calibrator Standard
• YSI 1531 D-Glucose Linearity Standard
• YSI 2363 Potassium Ferrocyanide
• YSI 2365 Glucose (Dextrose) Membrane Kit
• YSI 2392 NaCl Solution
B Principle of Operation:
Glucose measurement is based on the level of H O produced during the enzymatic reaction
2 2
between glucose and oxygen molecules in the presence of the glucose oxidase enzyme. At a
constant potential, electroactive H O is oxidized at the surface of the platinum anode. The
2 2
current generated by the flow of electrons at the surface of the platinum electrode is proportional
to the glucose concentration of the sample.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
YSI 2900C Biochemistry Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen may be identified by scanning a barcode or by manually entering the information
via the instrument touchscreen.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A sample, contained in vials or tubes of various forms, is placed in a configured holder on the
instrument. A robotic sampling sipper/injector travels to the sample and withdraws a sample
from it. The glucose containing sample is transferred to and injected into a reaction chamber.
Within the reaction chamber the sample is mixed to homogeneity with the co-contained
system buffer.
4. Calibration:
The YSI 2900C Biochemistry Analyzer’s default setting is automatic self-calibration of the
enzyme sensors every five samples or every fifteen minutes to a known concentration.
5. Quality Control:
To ensure that the YSI 2900C Biochemistry Analyzer is operating properly, two levels of
quality control should be used and daily operational checks should be performed before
running samples as described in the operation manual.

2. Linearity:
Linearity testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP06 2nd Edition. The dilution
series contained whole blood and plasma samples spanning concentrations throughout the
measuring range (1.9 to 998 mg/dL). The maximum % deviation from linearity observed
within the claimed measuring range was less than 10%. The results of the linearity study
support the claimed measuring range of 5-900 mg/dL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the candidate device was established following the
recommendations in CLSI EP07 guideline, third edition. Interference from certain
exogenous and endogenous substances was assessed using venous whole blood samples at
two glucose concentrations: low (40 mg/dL) and high (200 mg/dL). Control samples without
interferent were included with each target glucose level. Five replicate measurements were
obtained for each glucose level and control using three analyzers and three glucose
membrane lots. The following table lists the target glucose and substance concentrations at
which no significant interference was found.

D-xylose at concentrations higher than 100 mg/dL have significant interference and a
warning was included in the sponsor’s labeling as follows:
“Patients undergoing a D-Xylose Absorption Test and their treating clinicians should be
aware that concurrent testing for D-Glucose in the YSI 2900C Biochemical Analyzer may
show a falsely elevated D-Glucose reading. D-Xylose is a substrate for the glucose oxidase
enzyme in the sensing membrane and causes a positive interference. For example, at a
Glucose concentration of 60mg/dL and Xylose concentration of 600mg/dL will produce a
+12% bias.

Hyperglycemia may be incorrectly indicated and treatments based on those false results
may be harmful to the patient.
Hypoglycemia may be incorrectly nonindicated and treatments based on those false results
may be harmful to the patient.
Any D-Glucose results from the YSI instrument should not be used until the administered
D-Xylose is known to be cleared from the patient.”
Hematocrit at concentrations higher than 60% and lower than 20% may cause interference as
described in the sponsor’s labeling as follows:
“Hematocrit causes some varying proportional bias in the results. Elevated bias, up to
10%, may occur at hematocrit levels at 20 or below. Depressed bias, up to 10%, may
occur at hematocrit levels at 60 and higher.”
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Glucose measuring range = 5.0 – 900 mg/dL
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The candidate device’s standards are traceable to U.S. National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) glucose standard reference material SRM 917c.
6. Detection Limit:
Detection capability studies of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation
(LoQ) for glucose on the YSI 2900C Biochemistry Analyzer were conducted following the

9. Carry-Over:
The sponsor provided adequate information to support their device is not subject to
carryover.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted following CLSI EP09c 3rd Edition. Three
instruments/membrane lots were used for the candidate device and three analyzers for the
comparator (i.e., the predicate). Testing was conducted at one site on serum, K2EDTA
venous whole blood, K2EDTA venous plasma, and K3EDTA fingerstick whole blood
capillary samples. Less than 10% of samples tested were contrived.

The sponsor has provided information to support that the glucose evaluated on the YSI
2900C Biochemistry Analyzer can be performed using K2EDTA, K3EDTA, lithium heparin,
sodium heparin, and sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate on venous whole blood. K3EDTA is
the only anticoagulant that should be used for capillary fingerstick whole blood and
K2EDTA is the only anticoagulant that should be used for venous plasma samples.
