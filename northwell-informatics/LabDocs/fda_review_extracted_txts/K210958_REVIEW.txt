potentially serious disorders associated with changes in body acid-base balance.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For point-of-care or clinical laboratory setting
D Special Instrument Requirements:
i-STAT 1 Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT 1 System consists of the i-STAT 1 Analyzer and the i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue)
cartridges. The system is designed for use by trained medical professionals at the patient point of
care or in the clinical laboratory and is for prescription use only.
The i-STAT 1 Analyzer (previously cleared under k103195 as the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer)
is a handheld analytical device designed to run i-STAT test cartridges. The instrument interacts
with the cartridge to move fluid across the sensors and generate a quantitative result.
The single-use, disposable i-STAT CHEM8+ (blue) cartridge contains test reagents to analyze
venous and arterial whole blood at the point of care or in the clinical laboratory. The cartridge
format allows all the tests in the cartridge to be performed simultaneously. The cartridges contain
the required sensors, a fluid pouch, a sample entry well and closure, fluid channels, waste
chamber, and the necessary mechanical features for controlled fluid movement within the
cartridge. Cartridges require two to three drops of whole blood which are typically applied to the
cartridge using a transfer device, by the trained user before the cartridge is placed within the
analyzer.
B Principle of Operation:
Glucose on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge is measured amperometrically. A voltage is applied
to the cartridge electrodes with current generated by the reduction of hydrogen peroxide that was
K210958 - Page 3 of 13

--- Page 4 ---
produced by catalytic oxidation of glucose present in the sample by glucose oxidase. The current
is directly proportional to the concentration of the glucose.
Creatinine on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge is measured amperometrically. Creatinine in the
sample is hydrolyzed to creatine by the enzyme creatinine amidohydrolase. Creatine is then
hydrolyzed to sarcosine by the enzyme creatine amidinohydrolase. The oxidation of sarcosine,
catalyzed by the enzyme sarcosine oxidase, produces hydrogen peroxide. A voltage is applied to
the cartridge electrodes with current generated by the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. The
current is directly proportional to the concentration of the creatinine.
Sodium, Potassium, Chloride and ionized Calcium on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge are
measured by ion-selective electrode potentiometry; measurement of potential difference between
the ion selective electrode and the reference electrode. In the calculation of concentration is
related to potential through the Nernst equation.
BUN on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge is measured by the hydrolysis of urea in the sample to
ammonium ions catalyzed by the urease, and ammonium measured by ion-selective
potentiometry.
TCO2 on the i-STAT CHEM8+ Cartridge is measured by potentiometric determination of both
pH and pCO2, and calculated with an algorithm based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation,
which uses pH, PCO2, and ionic strength (sodium) measurements.
Hematocrit on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge is measured by the conductivity method.
Conductivity of the sample is inversely proportional to the concentration of red blood cells in the
sample. The hematocrit sensor first measures the electrical conductivity of the calibrant solution,
followed by the conductivity of the whole blood sample. The conductivity of the sample is also a
function of the plasma electrolyte concentration. The i-STAT Hematocrit test algorithm uses the
sodium concentration in the calculation of the test result.

Specimen stability
In support of the modification to add use of arterial and venous whole blood without anti-
coagulant and testing within three minutes of collection, a specimen stability study was
conducted. In the study, venous whole blood was collected without anti-coagulant from five
healthy donors. Each of the whole blood samples after collection was tested immediately
(control condition) and tested at four minutes (test condition). For each of the two conditions,
the samples were tested in replicates of 10 using one lot of cartridges and 20 analyzers. For
each analyte the specimen was considered stable if the difference between the mean results
(or median) of the test and the control condition was within the sponsor’s definition of
allowable error. Based on an analysis of the results of the specimen stability study, the
sponsor concluded that for i-STAT glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, iCa, BUN,
creatinine, hematocrit, and TCO2 tests on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge when tested on the
i-STAT 1 System demonstrated that whole blood samples collected without anticoagulant are
stable out to four minutes, which supports the labeling claim of three minutes.
6. Detection Limit:
The detection limit performance of the assays on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge with the i-
STAT 1 System was established with studies conducted in support of k183678 (glucose and
creatinine), k183688 (Na, K, Cl and BUN), k191298 (TCO2), k191360 (ionized calcium),
and k183680 (hematocrit).

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison accuracy performance of the assays on the i-STAT CHEM8+
cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System was established with studies conducted in support of
k183678 (glucose and creatinine), k183688 (Na, K, Cl and BUN), k191298 (TCO2),
k191360 (ionized calcium), and k183680 (hematocrit).
2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix equivalency assessment was conducted to support use of venous or arterial
specimens collected without anticoagulant. The study was conducted at one internal site and
three point of care sites (POC) sites. At the POC sites, two donor matched venous specimens
with and without lithium heparin were collected, and likewise arterial specimens were
collected. For the internal site, whole blood specimens from donors were collected in blood
collection tubes without anticoagulant. A portion of each native or contrived non-
anticoagulated sample was transferred to a lithium heparin blood collection tube to be used as
the anticoagulated control condition.
Specimens without anti-coagulant were tested with the i-STAT 1 System in duplicate with
the first results used in the analysis. Specimens collected with anti-coagulant (comparator
specimen) were tested in duplicate with the mean used in the analysis. The internal study
tested all analytes on the cartridge, except for TCO2 using native and contrived samples
(<10%). The three POC sites tested all analytes on the cartridge using only native samples.
One lot of i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridges was used. Multiple different i-STAT 1 Systems were
used at each site. The results were analyzed by combined data across all sites and analyzed
by a Passing-Bablok linear regression. No outliers were removed from the analysis. Based
on the results, as summarized below, the sponsor concluded that the samples (venous and
arterial) collected without anticoagulant are equivalent to those collected with heparin
anticoagulant for all analytes.
