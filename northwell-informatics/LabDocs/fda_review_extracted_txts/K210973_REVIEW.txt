5. Sample Preparation
The MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit requires RNA isolated from FFPE tissue specimens. FFPE
tumor block for each specimen to be processed are selected by using a tissue sample that
contains the greatest amount of invasive carcinoma and is morphologically consistent with the
submitted diagnosis.
One slide is used for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to determine the tumor cell
percentage and the remaining slides, depending on the size of the tissue, can all or partly be used
for the RNA isolation. The invasive tumor cell percentage must be at least 30% to obtain valid
results. When needed and possible, a macro dissection can be performed to avoid large areas of
in-situ carcinoma, necrosis, adipose tissue, stroma and/or hemorrhage as these will decrease the
overall invasive tumor cell percentage.
6. RNA extraction
MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit requires RNA isolated from FFPE tissue using the RNeasy DSP
FFPE Kit from QIAGEN. The quality of the total RNA is assessed by calculating the distribution
value (DV) 200 metric, which represents the percentage of RNA fragments >200 nucleotides
(nt). The recommended RNA input for MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit is 200 ng for poor quality
samples (DV200 ≥ 20% above 200 nt) and 100 ng for good quality samples (DV200 ≥ 70%
above 200 nt) with the total RNA recovered from tissue with a minimum 30% viable tumor
nuclei. The extracted RNA is immediately used for library preparation.
7. Library Preparation
The MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit workflow begins with isolation of RNA from FFPE breast
cancer tissue sections. FFPE total RNA is chemically fragmented to a target size of 200nt and
bound to random primers. cDNA is synthesized, end-repaired, adenylated at the 3’end and
indexed adapters are ligated. The cDNA adapter-ligated library is enriched by PCR
amplification. The amplified adapter-ligated cDNA library is quantified using a suitable nucleic
acid fragment analysis platform in the region of between 150 bp-550 bp prior to hybrid capture.
8. Hybridization Capture NGS
The adapter-ligated library is hybridized with biotinylated RNA library baits and targeted regions
are captured using magnetic streptavidin coated beads. Captured DNA libraries are purified to
remove baits and incompletely hybridized DNA fragments. Captured libraries are enriched by
PCR amplification. Primer dimers and residual reagents are removed by magnetic bead
purification. The quality and quantity of the amplified, target-enriched indexed libraries are

assessed using a suitable nucleic acid fragment analysis platform prior to sequencing. Samples
must be within the linear range of the assay (5-500 pg/µL) and the fragment size distribution
should be 150-700 bp.
9. Sequencing
cDNA adapter-ligated and captured libraries are pooled at equimolar concentrations before
sequencing. Sample pools of 1, 2, or 4 nmol/L starting concentration are denatured, diluted, and
loaded on a sequencing flow cell. Single-end sequencing is performed on the MiSeqDx
instrument at the length of 150bp using the MiSeq reagent kit V3 (150 cycles) qualified by
Agendia.
10. Data Analysis
MammaPrint analysis involves the use of MiSeqDx Operating Software. The MammaPrint
results are based on the raw data files called FASTQ files that are generated by the MiSeqDx
instrument. Generation of these raw data files is based on the workflow “Generate FASTQ”
within the Local Run Manager (LRM). No other built-in workflow of the MiSeqDx software is
used. Once the FASTQ files are generated, they are transferred to Agendia’s cloud-based
analysis tool which generates the MammaPrint results.
The FASTQ files generated by the MiSeqDx system are processed by ADAPT-US, which is a
high-performance and data security compliant cloud-based genomics analysis platform that
delivers integrated data interpretation of samples processed with the MammaPrint NGS kit.
ADAPT-US is the secure customer portal that is used to process FASTQ files against RPrint.
The RPrint software generates an output file that is used by the ADAPT Report Generation
software. The three technical components of ADAPT-US consist of:
• The customer web interface
The web interface component allows customers to select and run sample FASTQ
o
files. The customers can access the output reports created from the report generation
components from this web interface.
• The computer system that stores and executes RPrint
This component takes FASTQ files as an input and runs them through Agendia’s
o
RPrint software to produce the RPrint output file. RPrint custom software developed
by Agendia is comprised of several dedicated algorithms to determine High Risk,
Low Risk or Borderline for recurrence. The RPrint software contains the proprietary
MammaPrint algorithms which analyze the FASTQ files provided by the MiSeqDx
Sequencer.
• The report generation software
The report generation component utilizes the RPrint output file to generate the
o
MammaPrint Technical Reports.
11. Controls
Negative Control: A no template control (NTC) can be processed to serve as a negative
control to validate the acceptability of all the test samples processed through library
preparation and capture steps by testing for sample or reagent contamination. The NTC is
expected to fail both the Library Prep and Capture QCs. Passing QCs for the NTC at
these steps may indicate contamination.
K210973 - Page 6 of 26

--- Page 7 ---
Positive Control: Two types of positive controls, one that gives a High Risk result and
another that gives a Low Risk result are provided in the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit. One
of each type must be included every time a batch of samples is processed. Those two
controls are processed from library preparation through sequencing to serve as an end-to-
end control to demonstrate assay performance. The two controls must pass the quality
control model and give MammaPrint Indices (MPI) that fall within the acceptable range
for the controls. Failure of the controls to meet either condition will result in all test
samples on the run being reported as ‘No Result’.
12. Result Reporting
A test result is considered valid only if the Overall Assessment field on the Technical Report
says “Pass”. If any of the quality control metrics fail, the Overall Assessment will also indicate
“Fail”. If the Overall Assessment says “Fail”, the Technical Report will show "Unable to provide
result for this specimen" in the Test Results section. The testing laboratory may choose to retest
the sample to see if the subsequent result will yield a valid test result.
The MammaPrint result is reported as Low Risk, High Risk and Borderline for risk of distant
metastasis. The test result (Low Risk, High Risk, Borderline) of the sample is determined by
calculating the MPI on a scale of -1.000 to +1.000 with two cut-offs, -0.058 and +0.058. High
Risk results are those results that are less than -0.058 whereas Low Risk results are those above
+0.058. If a FFPE sample’s MammaPrint Index (MPI) falls within -0.058 and +0.058, then the
test result is termed as “Borderline” as these represent a range of scores with low reliability for
assessing risk of distant metastasis. The clinical significance of the Borderline region (-0.058 ≤
MPI ≤ +0.058) is not established.
13. Quality Metrics
Quality metrics are assessed in analytical and post-sequencing level. Analytical quality
assessment is conducted across the following categories:
FFPE total RNA: Quality Control (QC) assesses quality of the FFPE total RNA based on the
DV200 metric.
Amplified, adaptor-ligated cDNA libraries: QC assesses quality (cDNA fragments must fall in
the right size range, i.e., between 150 to 550 bp) and quantity (should be 200 ng of cDNA library
at a concentration of 58.8 ng/µL) of the adaptor-ligated cDNA library.
Amplified, target-enriched indexed libraries: QC assesses quality (cDNA fragments must fall in
the right size range, i.e., between 150 to 700 bp), quantity (pg/µL) and molarity (should be equal
to or above 1000 pmol/L) of the amplified, target-enriched indexed library.
The quality controls that assess quality at the level of the NGS run are outlined in the table
below.

B Principle of Operation:
The MammaPrint NGS FFPE kit consists of several processes: isolation of RNA from FFPE
breast cancer tissue sections; library preparation of RNA resulting in cDNA adapter-ligated
sequences; enrichment of the 70 genes (capture step); sequencing of the enriched library in the
flow cell and data acquisition; MammaPrint Index (MPI) calculation and determination of the
risk classification.
Data analysis is performed according to the specific MammaPrint FFPE algorithm, resulting in
determination of the MPI. This algorithm is designed and programmed by Agendia and compiled
into a proprietary standalone software program. The software loads the FASTQ data file,
performs quality control checks and determines the molecular profile of the sample by
calculating the MPI by determining the correlation of the sample 70 gene expression profile to
the mean expression profiles of the risk templates of tumors with a known good and poor
outcome. The MPI is reported on a scale of -1.000 to +1.000 (MammaPrint FFPE reportable
range), compares the calculated correlation to pre-defined cut-off values and determines the
sample’s prognostic profile. High Risk results are those results that are less than -0.058 whereas
Low Risk results are those above +0.058, except between -0.058 and +0.058, which is the
region/MPI for Borderline samples. The clinical significance of the Borderline region (-0.058 ≤
MPI ≤ +0.058) is not established.

VII Performance Characteristics:
A Analytical Performance:
Concordance between MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit run on MiSeq Research Use Only (RUO)
instrument and run on MiSeqDx instrument qualified by Agendia.
The purpose of this study was to establish the concordance between the MammaPrint FFPE NGS
kit run on the MiSeq RUO instrument and the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit run on the MiSeqDx
instrument qualified by Agendia to enable the use of MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit data generated
from MiSeq RUO instruments. The MiSeqDx instrument qualification was performed at the
Agendia laboratory in Irvine, USA. MiSeq RUO instruments were used initially for clinical
validation and analytical performance studies including repeatability of RNA isolation and kit
stability testing. In this study, RNA extracted from 50 FFPE samples were selected based on
results obtained from MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit run on the MiSeq RUO instrument. These
samples were subsequently analyzed using the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit run on the MiSeqDx
qualified by Agendia. The MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit results from both sequencers were
compared to assess the agreement between the two sequencers. Two samples failed QC when
tested with the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit run on the MiSeqDx qualified by Agendia, and
therefore provided invalid results. Agreement between the two sequencers was calculated for
valid results generated by both sequencers. Since the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit test reports
three (3) categories, High Risk, Low Risk, and Borderline, around two cut-offs, -0.058 and
+0.058, agreements were evaluated for each category and presented in Table 4 below.

The percent agreement for samples with High Risk and Low Risk categories was 93.10 (95% CI:
78.04, 98.09) and 94.12 (95% CI: 73.02, 98.96) respectively, demonstrating comparable
performance of MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit between MiSeq RUO instrument and MiSeqDx
instrument qualified by Agendia. While the percent agreement for Borderline cases was low, 50
(95% CI: 9.40, 90.60), this is likely due to the low reliability of the test for samples with MPI
scores between -0.058 and +0.058.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two site-to-site reproducibility studies were conducted at multiple sites to demonstrate the
precision and reproducibility of the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit using RNA extracted from
samples representing a range of MPI scores. In addition, the reproducibility of RNA from control
samples was also assessed in a reproducibility study. An RNA isolation repeatability study was
performed by conducting two independent RNA isolations from the same tissue block to
demonstrate that MammaPrint results are reproducible between two isolations from the same
tumor.
Site-to-site Reproducibility Study-1
In Study-1, site-to-site reproducibility of the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit was assessed across
four external sites in the United States, using three samples. The three samples were generated
by pooling of RNA representing the different MammaPrint categorical test results (High Risk,
Low Risk, and Borderline). Per site, each sample was tested by two operators across six (6) runs
in duplicate for a total of 24 measurements obtained per sample per site. In total, 96 replicates
per sample across the four sites were evaluated. The study design included three (3) different
MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit lots. A variance component analysis was used to estimate the
standard deviation for repeatability, between-run, between-operator, between-site, and
reproducibility for the study. These estimates were reported along with the number of
observations for the mean of MammaPrint Index (MPI) values. Results by variance components
and total variance are presented below for MPI. The column “N” included the number of data
points that generated an MPI value. Across all variance components, the total standard deviation
(SD) was ≤0.095 in all samples tested (Table 5).

Results of the sample level agreement were 100% for High Risk and Low Risk samples, and
81% for Borderline sample with the lower bound of the two-sided 95% score CI was 72%. The
mean MPI score of this sample was -0.013, which was close to the cut-off of -0.058, thus
explaining the disagreement of MPI score results near the threshold.
Results of this study demonstrate that for MPI scores well above and below the Borderline range
of -0.058 and +0.058, the precision is high. However, for samples with MPI scores near the two
cut-offs, -0.058 and +0.058 precision may be lower as shown by this study.
Site-to-site Reproducibility Study-2
A second site-to-site reproducibility study was conducted by testing an additional eight (8)
samples that were specifically selected to represent MPI scores close to or within the Borderline
category. The eight (8) samples were analyzed at three different sites, two external site and an
internal Agendia site. At each site, the samples were separately processed by two operators. Each
of the operators processed the samples twice and performed their own RNA extraction for both
sequencing runs. For both operators combined, this resulted in a total of four runs per site. Each
run was performed on a different day to incorporate day-to-day variations. Per run, each sample
was analyzed in duplicate, resulting in 8 replicate measurements per sample and site for a total of
24 replicates per sample. The sequencing runs were performed with Agendia pre-qualified
MiSeqDx instruments. A variance component analysis was used to estimate the standard
deviation for repeatability, between-run, between-operator, between-site, and reproducibility for
the study. Results are summarized in Table 7. Across all variance components, the total standard
deviation was ≤0.066 in all samples tested.

Of the eight samples, one sample failed QC at one of the sites and therefore only 16 replicates
from the other two sites were used in the analysis.
In the variance analysis based on the ANOVA model output, the total standard deviation (SD)
was ≤0.066 in all eight samples tested. In the concordance analysis, six samples produced 100%
agreement across all replicates, while sample 2 and sample 5 had 83% and 53% agreement only.
The lower concordance of those two samples was because the MPI scores were near the cutoff
point of -0.058 and +0.058.
Together the results of the second site-to-site reproducibility study demonstrates that
MammaPrint FFPE NGS test results are reproducible when MPI scores are well above and below
-0.058 and +0.058 cut-offs.
Reproducibility of MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit Controls
The reproducibility of MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit was also assessed by processing two control
samples with known MammaPrint results at the four external sites. RNA samples from these two
controls, one control High Risk sample (CTRL-HR) and a second control Low Risk sample
(CTRL-LR) were provided by Agendia to these sites. Per site, there were two operators who
processed this set of 2 samples across 6 runs until 12 measurements were obtained per site.
Additionally, there were three different lot numbers of the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit included
in this set up, each operator used each of the different lot numbers twice during these 6 different
days. For each control sample 50 QC passed measurements were obtained. Five measurements
failed QC for the two samples and therefore provided invalid results. A variance component
analysis was used to estimate the standard deviation for repeatability, between-run, between-

The variant component analysis used 48 measurements and the standard deviation was ≤0.065
for the two control samples tested. For the analyses of the sample level agreement, there were in
total 50 measurements, which included two additional measurements from two of the sites. The
agreement of MammaPrint categorical results for these two samples were 100% for High Risk
and Low Risk samples, demonstrating acceptable reproducibility for the two control samples.
Repeatability of RNA isolation
The purpose of this study was to determine the variability between RNA isolations of the same
FFPE tissue by comparing the MammaPrint-NGS results of two RNA isolations from each FFPE
tissue sample. In this study, fifty-one (51) samples of high and Low Risk categories with enough
FFPE tissue were isolated 2 times by a single operator, for a total of 3 operators, in 2 testing
sites, one internal and one external sites through multiple testing days. After the isolations were
performed the samples were processed further (Library preparation, Enrichment, and
Sequencing) on different days per isolation. This resulted in the generation of two results per
tissue sample processed on different days. Of the 51 selected samples, 8 did not pass the QC and
therefore provided invalid results. Agreement between the two RNA isolations was calculated
for valid test results and was found to be 100% for all three (3) categories, i.e., High Risk, Low
Risk, and Borderline calls (95%CI: High Risk: 86.2,100.0, Low Risk: 81.6,100.0, Borderline:
34.2, 100.0), demonstrating high concordance between isolations.

Interference
The impact of interfering substances on the performance of the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit was
assessed by processing RNA from FPPE samples tested in the presence of five substances,
genomic DNA (gDNA), proteinase K, actinomycin D, ethanol and NaOH, with each interfering
substance at varying amounts. The first two substances, gDNA and proteinase K were used in the
RNA isolation, while the other three substances, actinomycin D, ethanol and NaOH were used
during the NGS processing of the samples. The impact of potential interference from gDNA,
proteinase K, actinomycin D, and ethanol was tested by testing three (3) samples, one High Risk,
one Low Risk and one Borderline measured in duplicate with a total of six (6) measurements
with and without potential interferent.
To evaluate potential interferent from gDNA and proteinase K during RNA isolation, the
samples were tested with 100 ng of gDNA, and 20,000 ng proteinase K. Actinomycin D is used
during the NGS process with a standard concentration of 4 μg/μL. To assess the potential
interference from actinomycin D, the three (3) samples were tested with 240 ng/μL and 480
ng/μL Actinomycin D. Ethanol in its standard setting (70%), is used in multiple steps during the
NGS process. For this assessment, the three samples were tested with an excess of 2.5% ethanol
and an excess of 5% ethanol. Both concentrations were tested separately and in duplicate during
the library preparation step and the capture preparation step, resulting in four (4) datasets of six
(6) measurements each.
NaOH (0.2N) is used during the denaturation of pooled cDNA Library in the NGS process. For
this assessment, the pooled cDNA library set containing n = 29 samples was tested separately
with 3 mM NaOH and 5 mM NaOH and measured in duplicate.
The impact of the substances was assessed by assessing QC pass/fail, comparison of
MammaPrint index with regards to absolute differences between the results of the
standard/original versus test conditions, i.e., presence of interferent, and concordance with the
MammaPrint FFPE NGS results for standard/original versus test condition.
Except for NaOH tested at 5mM during denaturation of pooled cDNA Library, all samples with
and without potential interferent passed QC, i.e., provided valid results. The absolute difference
between MammaPrint indices of both conditions, with or without interferent were below the
technical variance of the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit. Further, concordance was 100% between
MammaPrint FFPE NGS results obtained with or without potential interferent for all conditions
evaluated except for excess of 3 mM NaOH.
Excess of 3mM NaOH during the denaturation of pooled cDNA Library, resulted in agreement
for high and Low Risk samples of 100% and 95.8% respectively. Further, two samples had
slightly higher absolute differences in MPI. Excess of 5 mM NaOH during the denaturation of
pooled cDNA Library resulted in 17.2% of the measurements failed QC. However, the
categorical MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit results were not impacted. According to the results, a
limitation in the package insert was established to caution that excess of 3mM NaOH should not
be used for the denaturation of pooled cDNA Library in the NGS process as it can lead to
increased assay failure.

Further, RNA specification provided are designed to minimize the presence of any effect from
interference of components such as hemorrhagic tissue, adipose tissue fibrosis material or
necrotic tissue on the performance of the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The MammaPrint Index is reported on a scale of -1.000 to +1.000, with two cut-offs, -0.058 and
+0.058 and determines the sample’s prognostic profile as Low Risk, High Risk, or Borderline.
High Risk results are those results that are below -0.058 whereas Low Risk results are those
above +0.058, except between -0.058 and +0.058, samples will be reported as Borderline.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Real-Time Stability of MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit
A real-time stability study was executed to determine the shelf life of the MammaPrint
FFPE NGS kit. Three lots of NGS kits, which includes RNA Preparation Kit, Target
Enrichment Kit, and the NGS Panel, and each kit is comprised of four boxes, were stored
at its recommended storage conditions, and tested at discrete timepoints over the course
of the study. In total eleven (11) clinical samples including High Risk, Low Risk and
Borderline, were tested at three different time points, 2-3 months from Date of
Manufacture (DOM), corresponding to baseline or time point zero, 12 months from
DOM, time point 1 (T1), and 26 months from DOM, time point 2 (T2). For each
measurement, the quality assessment, test results and test indices were recorded and
reviewed for stability. The T0 measurement is used as the reference timepoint – all
subsequent measurements were be compared with the T0 measurement. Data from T0, T1
and T2 time points were analyzed for Lot #1, Lot #2, and Lot #3. For Lot #1, all
measurements in timepoint T1 showed agreement with T0; however, in timepoint T2, one
sample switched from a MammaPrint Low Risk result to a Borderline result as the
MammaPrint index fell within -0.058 and + 0.058. The difference in MammaPrint index
between the T0 and the T2 for this sample was within the predefined allowable
difference. Since the difference in MammaPrint Index for this Borderline sample was
within the allowable difference, the switch in MammaPrint test outcome was accepted as
Borderline call for the sample. Therefore, all timepoints for lot #1 demonstrated
acceptable stability. For Lot #2, one High Risk sample at timepoint T1 showed an
absolute difference in MammaPrint index between the T1 and T0 results which exceeded
the allowable difference, however because it demonstrated agreement with the T0 call,
i.e., High Risk call, it was considered acceptable. For Lot #3 real-time stability studies,
all samples passed T0, T1 and T2 time points. The results support a shelf life for the
MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit of 25 months when stored according to the temperatures
indicated on the label.
b) Freeze-Thaw Stability
To demonstrate that the performance of MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit will remain stable
under varied conditions, a freeze thaw assessment was performed using three lots of
MammaPrint FFPE NGS kits for a total of six (6) cycles with assessments taken at three
(3) time points. Three (3) samples, one High Risk, one Low Risk and one Borderline
were tested after one freeze thaw cycle of the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit (C0), after 3
freeze-thaw (F/T) cycles (C1) and after 6 F/T cycles (C2). For each cycle, the
K210973 - Page 17 of 26

--- Page 18 ---
components of the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit were completely thawed and then placed
back into their labeled storage conditions for at least 4 hours to ensure complete freezing.
Results demonstrated that all samples passed QC after each testing, that sample results
after 3 F/T cycles and 6 F/T cycles were concordant with the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit
results at C0 and that MPI were within acceptable difference with C0. Based on the
results, the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit can be used for up to 5 F/T cycles.
c) Shipment Stability
MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit are shipped as small and medium packaging solutions, with
each solution, there are two boxes – one for room temperature reagents and one for
reagents that need to be kept cold (with dry ice), for all -80°C and -20°C reagents.
A shipping study was also performed to ensure that the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit
maintains the adequate level of performance after shipment. Within this study three
packaging configurations were tested with a small number of kits (1 or 2), one for a
medium number of kits (3 to 8), and one for a large number of kits (9 to 15). Controlled
shipping simulations were conducted based on recognized standards and successively
demonstrated that the packaging provided sufficient physical protection to its contents.
All kits from the small and medium packaging solutions passed the inspection and were
subsequently tested for performance assessment using samples that had been previously
processed with accepted kits. For all samples and kits tested, the difference in MPI were
within acceptable limits.
d) Sample stability
The clinical validation utilized samples that were between 6 and 10 years old. The
DV200 was used as an indication of RNA quality that is isolated from the block, which
indicates tissue stability.
Out of the 345 RASTER samples used for MammaPrint microarray validation, 316
samples were successfully processed using the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit. In the
clinical evaluation, there was a relatively large proportion of samples with a lower
DV200 value, however these samples generated an appropriate NGS result as
demonstrated in the clinical validation study, see Section C below. In addition, several
QC measures are included in the MammaPrint NGS kit to prevent erroneous results from
being generated due to sample quality (e.g., unacceptable sample degradation). Following
assessment of the starting material (tissue/RNA), a QC model that measures the quality of
the sequencing (such as Percent Mapped, Percent on Target, and Total Read Count) is
used. Additionally, MammaPrint-specific QCs included in this QC model (e.g.,
MammaPrint Total Counts and Median Counts) ensure quality of the MammaPrint result.
Failure of the quality metrics is interpreted by the test as an indication of low tissue
quality or low RNA quality.
6. Detection Limit:
Two studies were conducted to demonstrate the acceptable range of RNA input for MammaPrint
FFPE NGS kit.
In the first study, eight (8) FFPE breast cancer samples with DV200 “poor” quality (less than
50%) were evaluated. The selected samples cover the entire MammaPrint Index range, including
the Borderline region. RNA of each sample was diluted to lower the RNA input for the
K210973 - Page 18 of 26

--- Page 19 ---
MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit from 200 ng to 100 ng, 50 ng, 25 ng, and 12.5 ng. For each RNA
input level, all samples were processed repeatedly during several separate runs using the
MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit. Samples that passed all lab Quality Controls (QCs) were
subsequently sequenced. The eight (8) samples were repeatedly processed for each of the five
RNA input levels resulting in a total of 32 replicates processed with 12.5 ng RNA and 40
replicates processed for all other RNA input levels. QC passing rate was evaluated. The results
of this study demonstrated that samples with at least 100 ng RNA input and with DV200 values
ranging from 35% to 49% had valid rates ranging from 80% to 100%. Samples with RNA input
values below 100 ng and with DV200 “poor” quality ranging from 35% to 49% had valid rates
ranging from 0% to 100%.
To further assess whether RNA input (ng) below and above the RNA quality specific
recommendations in the instructions for use influences the assay performance, an additional
study was performed on DV200 “poor” (less than 50%) and DV200 "good” (greater or equal to
50%) samples separately. The limit chosen for the above and below recommended RNA input
are 200 ng for DV200 “poor” samples and 100 ng for better quality samples. For DV200 “Poor”
samples, 300 ng, 200 ng, and 100 ng RNA input were tested, while 200 ng, 100, ng, 50 ng, and
25 ng RNA input were tested for DV200 “Standard” (greater or equal to 70%) samples. The
same eight samples used for the LoD study were selected for the DV200 “Poor” experiment. For
RNA input of DV200 “Poor” samples, 40 replicates were tested for 200ng and 100ng RNA
input, while 14 replicates for 300ng RNA concentration. For DV200 “Standard” experiment, 6
samples were selected in which 2 were from the middle category DV200 “Good to Medium”,
based on their DV200 values. The 6 samples assessed contained equal numbers of High Risk and
Low Risk samples and covers the entire MammaPrint Index range. In DV200 “Standard”
samples, 18 replicates were tested for 200ng to 50ng dilutions and 15 replicates for 25ng RNA
input. QC passing rate was evaluated. The results of this study demonstrated that samples with at
least 100 ng RNA input and with DV200 values ranging from 35% to 80% had valid rates
ranging from 80% to 100%, while samples with 200 ng RNA input and with DV200 values
ranging from 35% to 80% had valid rates of 83% to 100%. Samples with RNA input values
below 100 ng and with DV200 “poor” quality ranging from 35% to 49% had valid rates ranging
from 0% to 100%.
Together, the data supports the specifications for DV200 ≥70% above 200 nt for 100 ng, and
DV200 ≥20% above 200 nt for 200 ng. For 150 ng the data supports DV200 ≥50% because at
100 ng RNA input with DV200 ranging from 35% to 40% the valid rate was at least 80% as
observed from the two studies.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
MPI cut-off is set at -0.058 and +0.058 for MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit.
B Comparison Studies:
Two method comparison studies were conducted at a single site (Study 1) and at multiple sites
(Study 2) to demonstrate the agreement between MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit and the
MammaPrint FFPE microarray test using RNA extracted from samples representing a range of
MPI scores.
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device – Study 1:
K210973 - Page 19 of 26

The concordance between the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit and the MammaPrint FFPE
microarray was assessed by testing a total of 155 samples. These samples complied with the
intended use population of the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit. These samples were previously
processed on MammaPrint FFPE microarray as part of routine diagnostics and covered the
entire MammaPrint readout range with sufficient number of samples representing High Risk,
Low Risk and Borderline. None of these samples were used in the development of the
MammaPrint NGS FFPE kit. Of the 155 samples, 90 were with High Risk MammaPrint
Index while 65 were with Low Risk index, as determined by the microarray analysis using
MammaPrint FFPE.
Since the NGS kit has three output categories (High Risk, Borderline, and Low Risk) and the
comparator method has two output categories (High Risk and Low Risk), comparison of
MammaPrint categorical results was performed by conducting two concordance analysis for
High vs Low Risk.
In the first concordance analysis, samples with MPI scores <0.058 (this also includes
Borderline samples with MPI scores of <0.058 and >-0.058) were treated as High Risk, that
is, positive results in the concordance analysis. Samples with MPI scores >0.058 were treated
as Low Risk or negative results. In the second concordance analysis, samples with MPI
scores <-0.058 were treated as High Risk or positive results in the concordance analysis.
Samples with MPI scores >-0.058 (this also includes Borderline samples with MPI scores of
<0.058 and >-0.058) were treated as Low Risk or negative results.
For the first analysis, comparison of the test results showed an Overall Percent Concordance
(OPA) of 97.42 % (95% CI: 93.55, 98.99) with a Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) of
93.85 % (95% CI: 85.22, 97.58) and a Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) of 100.00 (95% CI:
95.91, 100.00).
For the second analysis, comparison of the test results showed an OPA of 98.71 % (95% CI:
95.42, 99.65) with a NPA of 100.00 % (95% CI: 94.42, 100.00) and a PPA of 97.78 (95% CI:
92.26, 99.39).

between the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit and the predicate, MammaPrint FFPE microarray
(Tables 12).
2. Method Comparison with Predicate Device Study-2
The comparability of the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit and the MammaPrint microarray was
assessed by evaluating 303 FFPE samples. The 303 samples were processed by the
microarray test at Agendia. Then, the same samples were processed with the MammaPrint
FFPE on the NGS platform at four external sites, i.e., 74 being processed at Site 1, 76 at Site
2, 78 at Site 3, and 75 at Site 4. The distribution of the categorical MammaPrint results
analyzed on microarray varied slightly between the datasets selected by the four different
sites (Table 13)

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
The microarRAy prognoSTics in breast cancER (RASTER) study was conducted to
prospectively evaluate the risk of breast cancer distant metastases using a gene-expression
prognosis classifier as a risk estimation tool, in addition to clinicopathological factors. In this
multicenter observational study, the feasibility of MammaPrint® 70-gene signature developed
to predict the risk of breast cancer metastases was assessed in 16 community hospitals in the
Netherlands between 2004 and 2006. The primary objective of this multicenter observational
study was to assess the feasibility of implementing the 70-gene signature and to study the
clinical impact of the 70-gene signature test result on adjuvant systemic therapy (AST)
decision making. The secondary objective of the RASTER study was to assess the outcome
of patients for whom a gene expression classifier was used to determine the need for adjuvant
systemic treatment. A total of 427 patients were enrolled in the RASTER study with age 18–
61 years old and had a histologically confirmed unilateral, unifocal, primary operable,
invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast (cT1–3N0M0). After a protocol amendment in 2004,
the study allowed only patients aged 55 or younger could enroll. The study exclusion criteria
were a history of a malignancy (with exception of basal-cell carcinoma or cervical dysplasia)
and neoadjuvant systemic treatment. The study assessed the primary endpoint of distant-
recurrence free interval (DRFI) defined as a distant breast cancer recurrence or death from
breast cancer and the secondary endpoint of breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) defined
as mortality related to breast cancer.
Five years follow-up data were published which included the analysis of estimated five-year
distant-recurrence free interval (DRFI) and confirmed the prognostic value of the
MammaPrint (MP) published in the January 2013 issue of International Journal of Cancer.
Survival data was updated in 2017 to determine 10‐years median follow up for the distant‐
recurrence‐free‐interval (DRFI) probabilities.
To demonstrate the clinical validity of the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit, samples from the
prospective observational RASTER study were evaluated. RASTER samples were previously
processed between 2004 and 2007 on the MammaPrint Fresh microarray (K101454), for
K210973 - Page 22 of 26

--- Page 23 ---
which a 5-year clinical follow-up was available for the RASTER study for 427 subjects. A
subset of FFPE tissue samples from the RASTER study (n=345) that was previously
processed on the MammaPrint FFPE microarray as part of the clearance of the reference
predicate device (K141142) was used for the validation of MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit.
From the set of 345 samples, total RNA was available for 341 samples and 25 samples failed
QC. Therefore, a total of 316 samples were successfully processed using the MammaPrint
FFPE NGS kit and this dataset was used for survival analysis.
Clinical validation analysis was performed on the 316 samples that had NGS MammaPrint
results based on a 10-year median follow-up of the observational RASTER study. 89.6% of
the patients have 5-year follow-up data and 53% of the patients having 10-year follow-up
data (median follow-up 10.27 years). The data was analyzed based on the three (3)
categories, High Risk, Low Risk, and Borderline, determined by the two cut-offs, -0.058 and
+0.058. Comparison of clinical performance within the RASTER study between
MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit and the predicate device MammaPrint FFPE microarray was
evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier graphs and 5-year and 10-year survival percentages. Kaplan-
Meier plots suggest significant difference in survival curves among different risk groups for
MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit, p=0.001.
Comparison of Kaplan-Meier graphs
Results from MammaPrint® FFPE NGS kit and MammaPrint® FFPE microarray were
compared for the 316 FFPE samples with 5- and 10-year outcome data from the 427
RASTER patient samples. DRFI was the study endpoint as defined in the RASTER study.
Specifically, DRFI measures the time until the diagnosis of distant metastasis or death from
breast cancer. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a similar difference in DRFI between the Low
and High Risk comparing MammaPrint® FFPE NGS kit and MammaPrint® FFPE
microarray.

High Risk 129 15 88.2% (82.8-94.0) 22 82.0% (75.5-89.2)
The Low Risk patients classified by MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit demonstrated a 1.9% (95%
CI: 0-4.0%) and 4.8% (95% CI: 1.2-8.2%) chance of cancer recurrence within 5 years and 10
years respectively. Patients classified as High Risk by MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit,
demonstrated a 11.8% (95% CI: 6.0-17.2%) and 18% (95% CI: 10.8-24.5%) chance of
cancer recurrence within 5 years and 10 years respectively. The Borderline samples for both
5 and 10 years had a DRFI of 92.6%. The results for the Borderline samples may have low
reliability due to the small sample size.
The predicate, MammaPrint FFPE microarray showed 98.7% 5-year DRFI for Low Risk and
88.0% for High Risk. With the 10-year follow-up, DRFI estimate was 96.0% for Low Risk
and 82.8% for High Risk. Thus, the results indicated that both devices show similar clinical
performance based on the updated follow-up from the RASTER study.
The prognostic performance of MammaPrint FFPE NSG Kit was further investigated using
Cox proportional hazard regression analysis based on all follow-up data, 5-year follow-up
data, and 10-year follow-up data respectively. The evaluated clinicopathological factors
include adjuvant treatment status (i.e., whether a patient received or did not receive adjuvant
treatment such as chemotherapy (CT) and/or endocrine therapy (ET)), age (>50 vs ≤50),
tumor size, histological grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status (positive/negative), and human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status (positive/negative).
In both univariate and multivariate analysis, MammaPrint FFPE High/Low Risk result is
significantly associated with cancer recurrence based on all three follow up data (i.e., all
follow-up, 5-year follow-up, and 10-year follow-up). For the multivariate analysis,
MammaPrint FFPE NGS High/Low Risk result is significantly associated with cancer
recurrence for the three follow up data with estimated hazard ratios of 7.31 (95% CI: 2.50-
21.41), 12.55 (95% CI: 2.26-69.74), and 7.08 (95% CI: 2.23-22.49), respectively, after
adjusting for all other clinicopathological factors. No significant difference (p value < 0.05)
was seen for Borderline group vs Low Risk group, which may be due to the small sample
size for the Borderline group and the reliability of the results for this group may be low. The
result support the prognostic significance for MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit beyond that of
other clinicopathological factors.

“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Qualification of MiSeqDx instruments and Reagents
Agendia performs qualification of all MiSeqDx instruments that will be used by MammaPrint-
certified partners in the testing of patient samples with the MammaPrint FFPE NGS kit as part of
the partner certification process. For control of software versions installed on the MiSeqDx
instruments, Agendia maintains a list of MiSeqDx Control Software (MCS) versions that are
validated for use with the MammaPrint NGS kit and will update the list as new versions of MCS
are released by Illumina and validated by Agendia. For updates that are determined to impact the
test’s results or performance, validation of the software updates is performed to ensure the
instrumentation and software continues to operate within specifications.
Reagents that are required and not provided with the MammaPrint NGS kit are qualified for use
through Agendia’s Reagent Qualification procedures. Qualification of RUO reagents involves
the testing performed on a specified minimum number of samples where results from previously
cleared lots are available and MammaPrint index differences for paired results must be within

predefined acceptable limits. The lot numbers of the approved lots of controlled reagents are
available in the ADAPT-US system and the MammaPrint-Certified labs are required to select the
lot numbers for each of the controlled reagents when analyzing the samples in ADAPT-US.
ADAPT-US platform has adequate control measures that ensure MammaPrint-Certified labs use
Agendia-qualified reagent lots, MiSeqDx instruments, and versions of MiSeqDx software and
thus by preventing the generation of an incorrect or inaccurate test result.
