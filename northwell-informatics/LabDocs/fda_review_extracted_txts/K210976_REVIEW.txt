or preserved fecal specimens in transport media. Test results are to be used in conjunction with
information available from the patient clinical evaluation and other diagnostic procedures. Curian
Campy is intended to aid in the diagnosis of Campylobacter infection.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
• Rx - For Prescription Use Only
• The Curian Campy was evaluated using only fresh fecal samples and fecal samples stored in
Cary Blair media or C&S media. The performance of fecal samples stored in other transport
media (e.g., formalin, polyvinyl alcohol) has not been evaluated and therefore, should not be
used.
• No data exists on the effects of colonic washes, barium enemas, laxatives, or bowel
preparations on the performance of the Curian Campy. All of these procedures can result in
extensive dilution or the presence of additives that may affect test performance.
• The fluorescence signal obtained with this assay is invisible to the unaided eye. The test
results can only be obtained with the propose use of the Curian Analyzer.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The Curian Campy assay can only be run on the Curian Analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Curian Campy, for use with the Curian Analyzer, is a rapid, qualitative, fluorescent immunoassay for
the detection of Campylobacter spp. (C. jejuni/C. coli/C. upsaliensis/C. lari) in human stool, where
stool may be either unpreserved or preserved in C&S or Cary-Blair transport media. The Curian
Campy assay consists of a test strip enclosed in a plastic frame (test card), positive control reagent,
and an assay specific Aioprep sample preparation device. Curian Campy is a lateral flow-based
immunoassay for the direct detection of Campylobacter antigens in human stool. Curian Campy
utilizes monoclonal antibodies, specific for an antigen common to C. jejuni, C. coli, C. lari and C.
upsaliensis, as the capture and detector antibodies.
The Aioprep is pre-filled with blue tinted Sample Diluent and contains a filter and a sample metering
device. A sample of the patient’s stool specimen is transferred from the collection container to the
Aioprep, using either the included transfer pipette (for preserved or unpreserved, liquid/semi-solid
specimens) or the assay specific sample collection brush (for preserved or unpreserved, formed/solid
specimens) which is available separately as an accessory (not required for use). When using the
transfer pipette, the sample is added directly into the Sample Diluent within the Aioprep. When using
the sample collection brush, the brush with sample is inserted through the metering device to remove
excess stool and then is pushed directly into the Sample Diluent within the Aioprep sample
preparation device.
The diluted sample is mixed and dispensed dropwise into the sample port of the Curian Campy test
card. If present, the Campylobacter antigen binds to the monoclonal detector antibody conjugated to
fluorescent particles, forming a complex. As the sample moves through the test strip, the anti-
Campylobacter capture antibody, bound to the assay membrane at the test position of the strip, binds
the complex and yields a test line. When antigen is not present, a complex is not formed, and a test
line will not occur. As the sample continues to move further up the test strip, the polyclonal capture
antibody, bound to the assay membrane at the control position of the strip, binds the conjugated
antibody and yields a control line. A line at the control position of the test strip should be present
K210976 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
each time a sample or external control is tested. If the control line is not generated, adequate sample
flow has not occurred, and the Curian Analyzer will consider the test invalid.
The Curian Analyzer can be run in either “Incubate and Analyze” mode or “Analyze Now” mode. If
operating the Curian Analyzer in the “Incubate and Analyze” mode, the test card is inserted into the
Curian Analyzer, after which all further steps are automated. If operating the analyzer in “Analyze
Now” mode, the test card is incubated at 19-27ºC on the benchtop for 20 minutes before insertion
into the Curian Analyzer. If a patient specimen cannot be tested immediately/as soon as possible after
collection, unpreserved and preserved specimens (in Meridian Para-Pak C&S media) may be held for
up to 7-days at 2-8ºC. Alternatively, unpreserved or preserved specimens (in Meridian Para-Pak
C&S media) may be frozen for up to 59 days at <-20ºC prior to testing.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
All analytical studies were conducted in “Analyze Now” mode. The primary difference between
these modes is that in “Analyze Now” mode, the operator is responsible for the incubation time; in
the “Incubate and Analyze” mode, the instrument will wait to read the strip until the specified
development time has passed. A validation study was conducted to demonstrate that the “Analyze
Now” mode does not impact the results of the analytical studies in the conditions tested. See section
VII.A.3.“Analyze Now” vs. “Incubate and Analyze” Read Mode Study for more information and
the results of this study.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the Curian Campy assay was assessed across three testing sites, one of which
was internal. Two sample panels, one consisting of unpreserved (raw) stool and one consisting of
preserved stool (in C&S transport media) were evaluated. Panels were created by spiking C.
jejuni (strain ATCC #BAA-1234) whole organism into unpreserved and preserved pooled stool
negative matrix at the following concentrations: negative, high negative (just below C ), low
5
positive (~C ), and moderate positive (3x higher than the C ). Ten blinded sample panels per
95 95
stool matrix (i.e., unpreserved or preserved), each consisting of 16 samples per panel (1 negative,
5 high negatives, 5 low positives, and 5 moderate positives) were provided to each site for a total
of 160 unpreserved stool samples and 160 preserved stool samples per site. Testing was
conducted at each site twice a day over 5 non-consecutive days by two operators per day/site and
included three different kit lots (2 lots per site). Positive and negative controls were run with each
panel of masked samples. The results for unpreserved and preserved stool are show in in Table 1.

1A single replicate was not performed because the Curian Analyzer inadvertently shut down and there
was insufficient volume for a repeat test.
For the unpreserved low positive panel member, a low Percent Agreement (PA) with expected
results was observed (82.7%). Upon review of the study information, it was determined that the
PA for the unpreserved low positive sample was due to operator under-sampling with the Curian
Campy transfer pipette. To mitigate the risk presented by under-sampling, the package insert
instructions were revised to provide additional clarity regarding unpreserved specimen
handling/processing instructions.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-Reactivity and Microbial Interference
The Curian Campy assay was evaluated for cross-reactivity with the bacteria, fungi, and viruses
listed in Table 2 below. Bacteria and fungi were tested at >1.2x107 CFU/mL while all viruses,
except Norovirus, were tested at >1.0x105 TCID /mL. For Norovirus, five positive preserved
50
clinical stool specimens were evaluated for cross-reactivity. Norovirus cross-reactivity testing
was not performed with unpreserved stool. Testing for all other microorganisms was performed
with both unpreserved and preserved (in C&S transport media) stool matrices. Each non-target
microorganism was tested in triplicate.
For microbial interference testing, C. jejuni (strain ATCC #BAA-1234) whole organism was
spiked at 2x LoD in both unpreserved and preserved (C&S) stool matrix containing non-target
microorganisms (see Table 2). For Norovirus, unpreserved stool matrix was not evaluated;
rather, the preserved clinical stool specimens described above were tested in the presence of C.
jejuni at 2x LoD. Testing was performed in triplicate.

Prozone Study
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a high concentration of Campylobacter
(antigen) does not interference with a positive reaction in the Curian Campy test. High positive
samples were prepared by spiking a negative fecal pool with 1.73 x 108 whole organisms of C.
jejuni (strain ATCC #BAA-1234). Both unpreserved and preserved (C&S) samples were tested.
A total of 7 different dilutions were prepared and evaluated for both unpreserved and preserved
stool matrices. Testing was performed according to the Package Insert instructions in replicates
of five for each dilution. The results demonstrated that were was no overall hook affect, and that
elevated levels of whole organism did not affect the detection of Campylobacter.
“Analyze Now” and “Incubate and Analyze” Read Mode Study
To demonstrate that performance of the Curian Campy is not influenced by operating the device
in “Analyze Now” mode under the conditions used for analytical studies, a comparison study was
conducted with contrived positive samples prepared by spiking a negative fecal pool with C.
jejuni (strain ATCC BAA-1234) at 2-3x LoD. Negative samples and positive clinical specimens
were also included in the study. Each sample was tested on the Curian analyzer in “Analyze
Now” mode and “Incubate and Analyze” mode.
There was 100% agreement between the expected and observed results for all positive and
negative samples. These results demonstrate that there is no notable difference in performance
between “Analyze Now” and “Incubate and Analyze” modes in the analytical testing setting.
These study results are acceptable and support performing analytical testing solely in “Analyze
now” mode.

Specimen Stability and Freeze/Thaw Stability
The effect of specimen storage on antigen stability was evaluated for both unpreserved and
preserved stool samples. For this analysis, a sample panel consisting of 2 clinical negative
specimens (1 unpreserved and 1 preserved) and 4 contrived positive samples (2 unpreserved and
2 preserved) were evaluated. Contrived positive samples were generated by spiking C. jejuni
(strain ATCC BAA-1234) whole organism at 2x LoD. After baseline testing was performed,
stool samples were stored under the conditions outlined in Table 4 and tested according to the
schedule described in the same table.

1Only Meridian Para-Pak C&S medium was evaluated for refrigerated specimen stability. Other C&S
and Cary Blair transport media containing patient stool should be stored according to the
recommendations outlined in the respective transport media package insert.
2Only Meridian Para-Pak C&S medium was evaluated for frozen specimen stability and freeze/thaw
stability. Other C&S and Cary Blair transport media containing patient stool should be stored
according to the recommendations outlined in the respective transport media package insert.
Positive samples remained positive and negative samples remained negative throughout the
study. Based on these results, the recommended storage conditions and timeframes are as
follows:
Unpreserved stool
• Up to 168-hours (7-days) refrigerated (2-8°C)
• Up to 59-days frozen (-20°C or -80°C)
• Up to 5 freeze/thaw cycles when stored frozen (-20°C or -80°C)
Preserved stool
• Up to 96-hours (4-days) at room temperature (19-27°C)
• Up to 168-hours (7-days) refrigerated (2-8°C) for stool in Meridian Par-Pak C&S
medium
• Up to 59-days frozen (-20°C or -80°C) for stool in Meridian Para-Pak C&S medium
• Up to 5 freeze/thaw cycles when stored frozen (-20°C or -80°C) in Meridian Para-Pak
C&S medium
Diluted Specimen Hold Time Study
This study was performed to determine storage conditions the Curian Campy Aioprep Sample
Preparation Device containing stool, prior to testing with the Curian Campy assay. For this study,
the sample panel evaluated during the specimen stability study was analyzed. After baseline
testing was performed, samples were stored at room temperature (19-27˚C) or refrigerated (2-
8˚C). For samples stored at room temperature, testing was performed at 5, 9, and 25-hours
following storage, while refrigerated samples were tested at 25-hours post-storage. All positive
samples were positive, and all negative samples were negative. These results support that stool
specimens in the Aioprep may be stored up to 8-hours at room temperature or up to 24-hours
refrigerated prior to testing with the Curian Campy assay.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Detection Study
The limit of detection (LoD) for the Curian Campy test was determined using whole organisms
of C. jejuni, C. coli, C. lari, and C. upsaliensis spiked into unpreserved (raw) stool and preserved
stool in Cary Blair and C&S transport media. Three lots of the Curian Campy assay were
evaluated in the study. The concentrations were calculated in colony forming units per milliliter
(CFU/mL) and their equivalent in CFU/test by factoring in the dilutions and the final volume
used in the assay. The LoD is the microorganism concentration that yields a positive result 95%
of the time and a negative result 5% of the time. The LoD for each Campylobacter species and
stool type are presented in Table 5.

Inclusivity Study
The reactivity of the Curian Campy was established using the strains listed in Table 6.
For C. upsaliensis and C. lari reactivity testing, a subset of all isolates were clinical isolates
obtained from patients with symptoms of gastroenteritis that were isolated at the Centre National
de Reference des Campylobacters et Helicobacters – Universite de Bordeaux between 2013 and
2018. For reactivity testing, each strain was spiked into negative fecal matrix or preserved stool
(C&S) at 2-4x the LoD of the corresponding species reference strain used to determine the LoD
in Table 5 above, and then tested with the Curian Campy assay. Any strain which did not
produce 100% positive results at 2-4x LoD was tested at sequentially higher concentrations until
100% positive results were obtained. All C. jejuni and C. coli strains were detected at 2-4x LoD
in both unpreserved and preserved stool. All C. upsaliensis and C. lari strains were detected at 2-
4x LoD in unpreserved and preserved stool, except for those denoted in Table 7, where a higher
concentration relative to the LoD of the original reference strain was required. The reason for the
elevated reactivity levels is unknown but may reflect biological variation among the strains.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
To determine the preliminary cut-off the Curian Campy assay read on the Curian Analyzer, a
panel of clinical negative and contrived positive (near LoD) stool samples were evaluated. The
initial cut-off was validated during the prospective clinical study by testing a population of 1464
specimens, of which 18 were positive and 1425 were negative by the Curian Campy assay. The
results of the cut-off study were acceptable.

1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Prospectively Collected Specimens Study
The performance of the Curian Campy test was assessed with specimens prospectively collected
from patients with signs and symptoms of gastroenteritis. Specimens were collected from five
independent clinical sites. The sensitivity and specificity for the Curian Campy test was
calculated by comparing directly to culture and speciation results performed at the sites.
Prospective testing consisted of 1474 stool specimens tested in clinical microbiology laboratories
at Medical College of Wisconsin, Medfusion, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center,
Indiana University, and Tricore Reference Laboratories. Both “Analyze Now” and “Incubate and
Analyze” modes were used for specimen testing. The vast majority of stool specimens were
pipettable and were sampled using the transfer pipette provided in the Curian Campy kit. A small
subset were non-pipettable and thus were sampled with the Curian Campy Stool Collection
Brush (sold separately by Meridian).
The ages of patients ranged from less than 1 year to 99 years with 15.7% of the specimens
coming from patients that were <18 years of age. Of the 1474 patients tested, 60.8% were female
and 39.2% were male. No difference in test performance was observed based on patient age or
gender. Table 8 shows a summary of the clinical performance of the Curian Campy for all sites,
combined.

*The Standard of Care (SoC) testing of two of the three false negative specimens by a high sensitivity, FDA-
cleared nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) assay showed that one of the specimens produced a negative
Campylobacter result, whereas one of the specimens produced a positive Campylobacter result; the third
specimen was not subjected to NAAT testing as part of the SoC.
**Of the 28 false positive specimens, 10 were subjected to SoC testing by a high sensitivity, FDA-cleared
NAAT assay. Two of these 10 specimens produced a positive Campylobacter result, whereas eight produced a
negative Campylobacter result. Eighteen specimens were not subjected to NAAT testing as part of the SoC.
The results of the study show that the Curian Campy exhibited a sensitivity of 85.7% and a
specificity of 98.1% compared to culture and speciation. The sensitivity point estimate and lower
bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the sensitivity point estimate were slightly
lower than expectations for this type of assay. However, the sensitivity results were deemed
acceptable without the need to conduct additional clinical specimen testing for the following
reasons: (1) Challenges with performing prospective clinical studies during the COVID-19
pandemic, (2) One of the three specimens with a false negative Curian Campy result was
negative by a high sensitivity FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) assay. This result
suggests that the Curian Campy sensitivity is likely higher than the 85.7%-point estimate and, (3)
The prospective study was supplemented with archived positive specimens (see section
VII.C.Archived Study, below).
Archived Specimens Study
Additional testing with the Curian Campy was performed at five clinical sites using 290 archived
specimens, of which 29 were positive and 261 were negative by Campylobacter spp. culture and
speciation. The patient ages ranged from <1 year to 93 years. Compared to culture and
speciation, the sensitivity and specificity point estimates for the Curian Campy were 96.6% and
98.1%, respectively. The results of the archived study are illustrated in Table 9. These results are
acceptable.

Contrived Study
The performance of the Curian Campy was further evaluated by testing a panel consisting of C.
coli, C. lari, and C. upsaliensis isolates. All isolates, which were obtained from humans, were
procured from ATCC. Samples were prepared by spiking negative, pooled fecal matrix with

whole organism at 2x and 8x the LoD of the reference strain, which was used to confirm the
LoD. Both unpreserved stool and preserved stool (in C&S transport media) were evaluated
during the study. For each Campylobacter species, 25 samples were prepared in both unpreserved
stool and preserved stool, for a total of 50 positive samples/species. Sixty negatives were
included for blinding and randomization purposes. A subset of the panel was provided to each of
the five clinical testing sites for evaluation. Each site was provided both positive and negative
samples. Testing was performed over a period of several days at each site. The results of this
study demonstrated 100% positive percent agreement (PPA) with expected results for all C. coli,
C. lari, and C. upsaliensis isolates, regardless of stool matrix. These results are acceptable.
2. Clinical Specificity:
See section VII.C.1.Prospective Study above.
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Brush Bridging Study
The Curian Campy assay is for use with unpreserved human stool specimens and human stool
specimens preserved in Cary-Blair and C&S transport media. Most specimens are easily sampled
using the transfer pipette provided in the kit; however, some unpreserved stool specimens are
non-pipettable and require use of a specific brush (i.e., Curian Campy Stool Collection Brush,
sold separately by Meridian) to adequately collect the sample for analysis in the Curian Campy
assay. Fifty-three non-pipettable stool specimens (5 Campylobacter positives and 48 negatives)
were processed with the brush during the prospective and archived clinical studies, combined.
To further support use of the brush with the Curian Campy assay, an analytical bridging study
was performed that evaluated a panel consisting of contrived positive and negative samples
collected/processed with the brush. Contrived positive samples were generated by spiking C.
jejuni (strain ATCC #BAA-1234) into negative, non-pipettable stool samples. Ten samples were
prepared at 3x LoD and 25 samples were prepared at 5x LoD. Twenty-five negative samples
were also tested. Three non-expert operators tested each sample at one internal site. All positive
samples gave the expected positive results, and all negative samples were negative. These results
indicate that non-pipettable stool specimens can be collected with the brush prior to testing with
the Curian Campy assay.
