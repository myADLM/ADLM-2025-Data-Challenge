III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Lp(a) Ultra assay is intended for in vitro diagnostic use in the immunoturbidimetric
quantitative determination of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] in human serum and plasma using an
automated analyzer. The measurement of Lp(a) is useful in evaluating lipid metabolism disorders
and assessing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in specific populations, when used in
conjunction with clinical evaluation.
For In Vitro Diagnostic use.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Harmonization efforts for Lp(a) assay methods have suggested an impact of apolipoprotein(a)
isoform size (i.e. molecular weight) heterogeneity on some Lp(a) methods. The effects of
apolipoprotein(a) heterogeneity have not been assessed for this assay.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Lp(a) Ultra assay is comprised of a kit with ready to use liquids for the quantitative
immunoturbidimetric determination of lipoprotein (a). The kit contains two reagents sufficient to
perform 86 tests on the Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry Analyzer. Reagent 1 is comprised of
a glycine buffer at pH 9.0 with < 0.1% sodium azide. Reagent 2 is comprised of a 0.4%
suspension of anti-Lp(a) polyclonal antibodies latex particles at pH 7.3 and with < 0.1% sodium
azide. The Lp(a) Ultra assay is calibrated with the Lp(a) Cal Set consisting of five lyophilized
calibrators.
B Principle of Operation:
Lp(a) Ultra assay is a latex-based immunoturbidimetric assay to measure Lp(a) levels in serum
and plasma. The immunoturbidimetric assay is constructed with reagents that agglutinate due to
antigen-antibody reaction between Lp(a) in a sample and anti-Lp(a) antibody bound to latex
particles. This agglutination is detected as an absorbance change, with the magnitude of the
change being proportional to the quantity of Lp(a).

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the Lp(a) Ultra assay on the Beckman Coulter AU680
Chemistry Analyzer was established in two studies for within-run and within-laboratory
precision.
Study #1 – within-run precision
In the study, five samples (two controls, two serum pools, and one calibrator in serum) were
tested in replicates of 20 in one run for assessment of the within-run precision (repeatability).
The assessment was conducted on each of three days using one instrument and one reagent
lot. The within-run precision (repeatability) was calculated for each sample and for each day:

Study #2 – within-laboratory
In the study, five samples were tested in replicates of two per run, with two runs per day for
20 days for a total of 80 measurements per sample. The study was performed using one
instrument and one reagent lot. The results for each sample presented in the table below were
analyzed for variance by an ANOVA method for the factors of within-run, run, and day. The
within-laboratory SD and %CV were estimated using the summation of the within-run,
between-run, and between-day variance components.

2. Linearity:
The linearity performance of the Lp(a) Ultra assay was evaluated in a study following the
recommendations in CLSI EP06 Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement
Procedures, 2nd Edition. In the study, a dilution series of 13 samples were prepared by inter-
mixing known volumes of a high Lp(a) concentration serum pool and low Lp(a)
concentration serum pool. Each sample was measured in triplicate using each of two reagent
lots on a Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry Analyzer. The data were analyzed by linear
regression using the mean of the observed result versus the expected concentration based on
the known dilution ratio. Deviations from linearity within the claimed measuring range were
never observed to be greater than ±10%. Based on these results, the sponsor concluded that
the test system demonstrated a linear response over the claimed measuring range of 10 to 100
mg/dL.
High dose hook effect study
The sponsor provided data to support the claim that no high dose hook effect is observed
with this assay for Lp(a) concentrations up to 500 mg/dL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the Lp(a) Ultra assay on the Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry
Analyzer was established by conducting interference testing following the recommendations
in CLSI EP07 3rd Edition. Interference from certain endogenous and exogenous substances
was assessed using two serum pools with low and high Lp(a) concentrations of 30 mg/dL and
50 mg/dL. Each low and high sample was further divided into two aliquots: control (with no
added interferent) and test (with added interferent). Each sample was tested in 5 replicates
using one lot and one instrument. A substance was identified as an interferent if the
difference in the mean between the control and test sample was outside of the predefined
allowable error of within ± 10% or ± 3 mg/dL. The observed maximum interference was
-5% with absolute difference of -2.2 mg/dL for the following levels of interfering substances:

4. Assay Reportable Range:
See linearity section VII A.2.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The Lp(a) Ultra assay is metrologically traceable to externally sourced calibrators with
assigned values. For each new lot of calibrators, the assigned values are verified by the
sponsor to be within an acceptance interval by testing against the previous lot of calibrators.
6. Detection Limit:
Detection capability studies of the Lp(a) Ultra on the Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry
Analyzer for limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ)
were conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB
The LoB for the Lp(a) Ultra assay was evaluated using four zero-analyte saline samples, and
two reagent kit lots and one instrument. Each of the four samples was measured in replicates
of 5 with each of the two lots over three days for a total of 60 replicates per lot. The LoB was
analyzed by the parametric method described in the guideline and found to be 0.7 mg/dL for
both lots.
LoD
The LoD was evaluated using four low-level samples prepared from serum pools using 2
reagent lots and one instrument. The samples were tested in replicates of 5 using each of two
lots on three different days for a total of 60 measurement per lot. For each lot, the LoD was
analyzed using a parametric data analysis which was the lowest concentration at which the
analyte can be detected with 95% probability based on n = 60 replicates. The LoD of the
assay was selected from the highest value obtained across the two lots; 1.9 mg/dL.
LoQ
The LoQ was evaluated using 8 low-level samples prepared from serum pools diluted with
saline using two reagent lots and one instrument. Each of the samples was tested in replicates
of 10 for each of the two lots on three different days for a total of 30 measurements per
sample per lot. The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration of analyte which has
imprecision of less than or equal to 20% CV. The LoQ of the assay was selected from the
highest value obtained across the two lots; 3.0 mg/dL.

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix equivalency study to serum was conducted to support use of the Lp(a) Ultra assay
on the Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry Analyzer with additional specimen matrix types
claimed in the product labeling: Na-heparin plasma, Li-heparin plasma, K2EDTA plasma,
and K3-EDTA plasma. In the study, 57 donor matched venous specimens of the
aforementioned were collected. Each specimen was tested in singlicate using one lot of the
reagent kit and one instrument, and the results compared to the mean of duplicate serum
measurements. The results were analyzed by Passing-Bablok regression with the
concentration from the first replicate of each donor’s evaluation tube (y-axis) versus the
mean concentration of the serum results (x-axis). The slope and intercept of the regression
line were calculated, and summarized as follows:

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Not applicable.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Reference values for the expected concentration range of Lp(a) are taken from literature data.
This information is provided in the REFERENCE VALUES section of the product labeling as
follows:
REFERENCE VALUES
The defined threshold of Lp(a) concentration at which individuals can be classified as being at
increased risk varies greatly among studies, ranging from 20 mg/dL to 40 mg/dL.
A Lp(a) concentration of 30 mg/dL corresponding to the 75th percentile in a male Caucasian
reference population is widely used as cut-off or threshold value.1,2 Different Lp(a) levels can be
found in different racial/ethnicity groups.3,4 Increased serum Lp (a) concentrations are associated
with increased risk of premature coronary artery disease and stroke. Because Lipoprotein (a)
levels are highly heritable, Lp (a) may be an important marker for premature CHD, especially
among Caucasians. Although Lipoprotein (a) levels are higher in African Americans than in
Caucasians, associated CHD risk appears to be less.5 It is recommended that each laboratory
establish its own range of normal Lp(a) values for the population in their region. For diagnostic
purposes, results obtained should always be evaluated considering the patient's history and all
other clinical findings.
