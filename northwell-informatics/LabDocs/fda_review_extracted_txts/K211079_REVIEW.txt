C Type of Test:
A nucleic acid test intended for use with the FilmArray 2.0 or FilmArray Torch systems for the
qualitative in vitro detection and identification of nucleic acids from severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from individuals
suspected of COVID-19.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 is a qualitative nested multiplexed RT-PCR in vitro diagnostic
test intended for use with the BioFire FilmArray 2.0 and BioFire FilmArray Torch Systems. The
BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 detects nucleic acids from severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from symptomatic individuals
suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider.
Results are for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA is generally
detectable in NPS specimens during the acute phase of infection. Positive results are indicative
of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; clinical correlation with patient history and other
diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status. Positive results do not
rule out co-infection with other pathogens.
Results are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory
data, in accordance with the guidelines provided by the relevant public health authorities. The
BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 is intended for use by trained medical and laboratory professionals in
a laboratory setting or under the supervision of a trained laboratory professional.
C Special Instrument Requirements:
FilmArray 2.0 or FilmArray Torch systems
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 is a multiplexed nucleic acid-based test designed to be used with
BioFire FilmArray systems (BioFire FilmArray 2.0 or BioFire FilmArray Torch). The BioFire
COVID-19 Test 2 consists of the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 pouch which contains freeze-dried
reagents to perform nucleic acid purification and nested, multiplexed polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) with DNA melt analysis. The BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 conducts three independent tests for
K211079 - Page 2 of 36

--- Page 3 ---
the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in
nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) eluted in transport medium or saline. Results from the BioFire COVID-
19 Test 2 are available in about 45 minutes.
A test is initiated by loading Hydration Solution into one port of the pouch and a NPS specimen
mixed with the provided Sample Buffer into the other port of the pouch. The pouch contains all the
reagents required for specimen testing and analysis in a freeze-dried format; the addition of
Hydration Solution and the Sample Buffer rehydrates the reagents. After the pouch is prepared, the
FilmArray Software on the FilmArray system guides the user through the steps of placing the pouch
into the instrument, scanning the pouch barcode, entering the sample identification, selecting the
appropriate protocol, and initiating the run on the FilmArray system.
The FilmArray instruments contain a coordinated system of inflatable bladders and seal points,
which act on the pouch to control the movement of liquid between the pouch blisters. When a
bladder is inflated over a reagent blister, it forces liquid from the blister into connecting channels.
Alternatively, when a seal is placed over a connecting channel it acts as a valve to open or close a
channel. In addition, electronically controlled pneumatic pistons are positioned over multiple
plungers to deliver the rehydrated reagents into the blisters at the appropriate times. Two Peltier
devices control heating and cooling of the pouch to drive the PCR reactions and subsequent melt.
Nucleic acid extraction occurs within the FilmArray pouch using mechanical and chemical lysis
followed by purification using standard magnetic bead technology. After extracting and purifying
nucleic acids from the unprocessed sample, a nested multiplexed PCR is executed in two stages.
During the first stage, a single, large volume, multiplexed reverse transcription PCR (rt-PCR)
reaction is performed. The products from first stage PCR are then diluted and combined with a fresh,
primer-free master mix and a fluorescent double stranded DNA binding dye (LC Green Plus, BioFire
Defense, LLC). The solution is then distributed to each well of the array. Array wells contain sets of
primers designed specifically to amplify sequences internal to the PCR products generated during the
first stage PCR reaction. The 2nd stage PCR and melt, or nested PCR, is performed in each well of
the array. At the conclusion of the 2nd stage PCR, the array is interrogated by melt curve analysis for
the detection of signature amplicons denoting the presence of specific targets. A digital camera
placed in front of the array captures fluorescent images of the PCR2 reactions The FilmArray
software automatically analyzes the results of each DNA melt curve and the results of the internal
pouch controls to provide a final test interpretation.

B Principle of Operation:
The FilmArray instrument, software, and pouch work together to perform sample lysis and
purification, amplification, and detection of nucleic acid. The basic sequence of actions and their
associated instrument functions are outlined in Figure IV2. These steps are similar to what was
described in DEN200043 and K170883.
Figure IV. The basic steps performed during a BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 run
The FilmArray instrument drives the various steps in the testing process by moving liquids to the
appropriate locations within the pouch. Liquid reagents are moved to the blisters of the pouch by
means of pneumatic actuators in the instrument piston block, which press on the syringe-like
plunging devices in the pouch fitment. There are twelve pistons that operate in a specified
sequence to deliver reagents to the appropriate blisters in the pouch at the appropriate times.
Within the pouch, liquids are moved by using bladders and hard seals to exert pressure on the
exterior of the pouch. The instrument is never in contact with the liquids contained in the pouch.
The bladders are inflatable elastomeric membranes used to compress the pouch blisters, thus
forcing the liquid out of the compressed blister and along any open connecting channels. The
hard-seals are piston-driven acutators that pinch shut specific channels, thereby directing the
flow of liquids between the blisters.
Thermal interactions between the pouch and instrument play a crucial role in amplifying target
nucleic acids. Temperature control is driven by a pair of numerically controlled Peltier devices.
The Peltier devices heat and cool to thermocycle the first- and second-stage PCR reactions
(PCR1 and PCR2, respectively) and carefully control the temperature across the array during
high-resolution DNA melting.
The instrument uses blue LED to illuminate the second-stage PCR array and a digital camera to
record fluorescence generated in PCR2. The optical system is designed to detect the fluorescence
signal generated during DNA melting.
The instrument communicates with the computer and the FilmArray Software using Ethernet
cables. The software provides instructions to the instrument to control each of the steps described
above.
K211079 - Page 6 of 36

--- Page 7 ---
A detailed explanation of specific steps in the testing process are as follows:
1. Sample Lysis and Purification
Sample lysis and nucleic acid purification uses bead beating followed by adsorption to
magnetic beads.
a) Sample Lysis
Prior to loading the sample into the pouch, nucleases are inactivated by mixing the
sample with a denaturing buffer (BioFire FilmArray Sample Buffer). The sample/buffer
mixture is then loaded into the pouch via the sample injection port. The pouch vacuum
pulls the liquid into the sample well of the pouch fitment where it rehydrates a freeze-
dried pellet of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The S. pombe is processed in parallel with
the patient sample through each step of the test. The RNA Process Control assay targets
an mRNA of S. pombe, so that a positive result for the RNA Process Control assay
indicates that all steps in the test functioned properly.
A piston located above the fitment plunges the sample/buffer mixture from the sample
well into the sample lysis blister which contains silica beads. The instrument seals the
fitment to prevent sample loss, then activates the bead beater assembly. During the bead
beating process, cells and organisms/viruses are lysed and the cell/capsid contents
(including nucleic acids) are released into the reaction mixture.
b) Nucleic Acid Purification
Following sample lysis, bladder inflation mixes magnetic beads with the lysed sample to
adsorb free nucleic acids. The bound nucleic acid on the magnetic beads are then
separated from the silica beads, the former retained in the collection blister while the
latter are moved back into the lysis blister with unbound waste. Alternating bladder
inflation facilitates movement of wash buffer over the magnetic beads to remove
unbound proteins, cell debris, and other potential PCR inhibitors, and this waste is sent to
the lysis blister. After the washes are complete, a piston plunges elution buffer into the
pouch to mix with the nucleic acid bound beads. This releases the nucleic acids from the
magnetic beads and the retractable magnet retains the beads in the collection blister while
bladder inflation moves the eluted nucleic acid solution to the first-stage PCR (PCR1)
blister.
2. Reverse Transcription and PCR1
The introduction of the eluted, purified nucleic acid solution into the first-stage PCR1 blister
rehydrates the reagents for this step in the assay. Subsequently, the master mix solution and
the eluted nucleic acid solution with the PCR primers are individual preheated prior to
mixing the two components together to setup a “hot start” RT reaction. The actuation of
pistons enables the mixing of the heated master mix with the nucleic acids and primers. The
RT reaction converts viral RNA into cDNA that is then amplified in the PCR1 reaction. The
Peltier device cycles the appropriate temperature for the RT and PCR1 reactions.
K211079 - Page 7 of 36

--- Page 8 ---
3. Dilution, PCR2, and DNA Melt Analysis
The system then moves most of the leftover PCR1 solution and products to the lysis blister so
that a smaller volume is left behind to be diluted with dilution buffer. Mechanical actuation
then enables PCR2 master mix with double-stranded NDA-binding dye (LCGreen Plus,
BioFire) to be added to the pouch and it mixes with the diluted PCR1 products. Bladder
inflation then forces this mixture into the array where PCR2 is carried out. As the mixture
distributes over the array, it rehydrates and distributes the inner primers in each well. These
“nested” (i.e., internal to the PCR1 products) primers target specific nucleic acid sequences
from SARS-CoV-2 or the S. pombe RNA Process Control.
The array also includes primers for the PCR2 Control. The PCR2 Control consists of a
specific set of PCR2 assay primers along with their corresponding template. Failure of the
PCR2 Control invalidates the run and indicates a test failure specific to the PCR2 process.
A Peltier device controls the temperature during PCR2 and DNA melting. An optical system
records the fluorescence of the LCGreen Plus dye, which fluoresces in the presence of
double-stranded DNA in each array well at each amplification cycle. At the conclusion of
PCR2, the temperature of the array is gradually increased to denature the double-stranded
DNA, and the optical system records the consequent decrease in fluorescence in each well.
The instrument then transfers images and temperature measurements to the FilmArray
Software for analysis to generate a melt curve for each well.
4. Data Analysis and Result Reporting
The temperature at which a specific PCR product melts (melting temperature of Tm) is
consistent and predictable. The FilmArray software automatically evaluates the results from
replicate wells of each assay for the detection of amplicons with a specific Tm, which
denotes the presence of specific viral targets. The FilmArray software uses the following
steps to interpret the melt curve data generated from each BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 assay—
a) Analysis of Melt Curves
First, the BioFire FilmArray Melt Detector performs a set of basic calculations on the
melt data to determine if a PCR reaction occurred in each well. If the melt profile
indicates that a PCR product is present, then the analysis software calculates one or two
Tm values, depending on the number of melt curves present in the data, and the Tm
values are compared against an expected melt range for the associated assay. If the
software determines that the melt is positive and the melt curve falls inside the assay’s
specific melt range, then the curve is called positive. If the software determines that the
melt is negative or that it is not in the appropriate range, then the curve is called negative.
b) Analysis of Replicates
The analysis software then evaluates the replicates for each assay (targets and controls) to
determine if the assay is positive or negative. For an assay to be called positive, two of
the three associated melt curves must be called positive and both Tm’s must be similar
(i.e., within 1 ℃). Assays with replicates that do not meet these criteria are called
negative.
K211079 - Page 8 of 36

--- Page 9 ---
c) Analysis of Controls
Results for control assays are compared to their expected values and assigned a single
pass or fail result for each control. There are pouch-specific rules that define how control
failures affect result interpretations. The default rule specifies that any control failure
invalidates the entire run. For the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2, failure of the RNA Process
Control and/or the PCR2 Control is interpreted as a control failure and all target assays
(regardless of the assay result) are assigned a test result of invalid.
d) Interpretation of Assay Results
Once the results for the individual assays are determined, the software applies
interpretation rules to determine the final test result. The final test result is either
“DETECTED” (positive result), “NOT DETECTED” (negative result) or “INVALID”
(when either there is a control failure as detailed above or a run failure).
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
FilmArray 2.0 or FilmArray Torch System
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification can be entered manually or via a barcode
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 is intended for use with nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens
collected in transport medium or saline. The operator places a Hydration Injection Vial and a
Sample Injection Vial into the FilmArray Pouch Loading Station. The operator first hydrates the
test pouch with the Hydration Injection Vial, and then using a transfer pipette provided in the kit,
the operator adds 0.3 mL (300 µl) of specimen into the Sample Injection Vial. Sample Buffer is
then added into the Sample Injection Vial using the provided Sample Buffer tube. The operator
closes the Sample Injection Vial, removes the Sample Injection Vial containing the sample
mixture from the Pouch Loading Station, inverts the vial at least three times to mix, and then
places the Sample Injection Vial back onto the red well of the Pouch Loading Station. A 5 second
wait time after uncapping the Sample Injection Vial is instructed to reduce contamination. The
Sample Injection Vial is then inserted into the pouch sample port where the proper amount of
specimen is pulled into the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 pouch by vacuum. The BioFire COVID-19
Test 2 pouch is then placed in the FilmArray 2.0 instrument or the available module of a
FilmArray Torch system for testing.

5. Quality Control:
Two process controls are included in each BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 pouch:
1. RNA Process Control
The RNA Process Control assay targets an RNA transcript from the yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The yeast is present in the pouch in a freeze-dried form and
becomes rehydrated when sample is loaded. The control material is carried through all
stages of the test process, including lysis, nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription,
PCR1, dilution, PCR2, and DNA melting. A positive result indicates that all steps carried
out in the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 pouch were successful.
2. PCR2 Control
The PCR2 Control assay detects a DNA target that is dried into wells of the array along
with the corresponding primers. A positive result indicates that PCR2 was successful.
Both control assays must be positive for the test run to pass. If controls fail, the sample should be
retested using a new pouch.

4. Special Control
 As per 21 CFR 866.3981 Special Control (4)(ii), and following the guidance “Policy
for Evaluating Impact of Viral Mutations on COVID-19 Tests, Guidance for Test
Developers and FDA Staff (February 2021)”, the sponsor provided a proposed risk
analysis and documentation to continuously monitor for genetic mutation and/or
novel respiratory pathogen isolates or strains that may adversely impact device
performance.
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed to evaluate the potential for run-to-run and/or day-to-
day variation in the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 performance, and any potential variation due
to test site, reagent lot, operator, and/or FilmArray instrument. The study was performed
using three samples, prepared using pooled negative clinical NPS specimens in transport
medium as the sample matrix. One sample was spiked with SARS-CoV-2 (heat inactivated;
USA-WA1/2020) at 3x LoD (moderate positive), another sample was spiked at 1x LoD (low
positive), and the third sample was not spiked (negative sample). Six replicates of each
sample were tested on five different days at three test locations for a total of 90 replicate test
results per sample (30 per site).
Reproducibility was evaluated using both FilmArray 2.0 instruments and Torch modules (45
tests per sample type on each FilmArray system). BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 pouch reagent
lots were rotated daily according to site-specific rotation schedules. In total, 270 valid test
result were obtained.
The collected data was evaluated for the following parameters:
• The percent agreement between the observed and expected test results at each test
level (acceptance criteria = ≥95% for each sample at each test site, and overall).
K211079 - Page 14 of 36

--- Page 15 ---
• The reproducibility of assay Tm values (i.e., standard deviation; acceptance criteria =
Assay Tm standard deviation of all replicates for the same assay tested at the same
concentration is 0.5°C or less).
• Any observed detection trends.
During the study, though the protocol specified that testing should be performed at each site
with the same pre-assigned FilmArray instrument(s)/module(s) for all five test days, an
Torch module was replaced at one of the test sites due to a reset/hardware stability issue.
This was replaced with a functioning unit and no other study deviations were reported.
Overall, there were no reported test or run failures reported at all three sites, instruments,
operators, or test days. All 270 total runs for this study completed with valid results
(270/270; 100%).
A summary of reproducibility test results is shown below (Table 1). The SARS-CoV-2
Detected rate for the spiked samples met the acceptance critera. However, for the negative
sample, Sites 2 and 3 had unexpected Detected results. The three unexpected results occurred
with three different pouch reagent lots, three different users, three different FilmArray
instruments, and on three different test days after swab test checks prior to conducting the
study for the day did not show contamination. Further investigation to trace the cause of the
unexpected results did not yield any conclusive explanation on why the Detected results were
observed.

c Clinical NPS specimens in transport medium were collected during the COVID-19 outbreak and therefore SARS-
CoV-2 infection at levels below LoD may have gone undetected during characterization of the pooled sample
matrix.
A secondary assessment of reproducibility is based on variability in the Tm of the
amplification products measured as standard deviation. Table 2 shows the results per test site,
and table 3 shows the results per FilmArray system. The melt temperature mean, standard
deviation (StDev) and coefficient of variation (CV) are shown for internal pouch control
assays and the SARS-CoV-2 assays. The variability in the melt temperatures for the assays
were all within the expected range (≤0.5°C) for each assay per site and per FilmArray
system. Mean Tm values were within 0.2°C between the two different FilmArray systems.

Overall, there were no detection trends among the three different sites and two FilmArray
Systems evaluated that would indicate a reproducibility issue (i.e., no significant differences
in observed values across the different test sites). Although unexpected Detected results for
unspiked samples were observed when evaluating the percent agreement between observed
and expected test results, they were not related to the variables evaluated in the multi-site
reproducibility evaluation (i.e., pouch reagent lot, instrument/system, operator, etc.). A root
cause for the unexpected Detected results in the study could not be determined. However, in
consideration of the percent agreement between observed and expected test results for most
of samples tested, Tm variability within the expected range, and the lack of detection trends

from testing at all sites, operators, instruments, and days, the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2
device performance appears to be reproducible.
The device can provide accurate and highly reproducible test results in the context of
multiple variables that may be expected in a clinical testing environment, including analyte
concentration, location, test day, operator, FilmArray system, and reagent lot.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable; this is a qualitative assay.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a) Specificity
The potential for assay cross-reactivity was evaluated by challenging the test with a panel of
viruses and organisms at high concentrations. These viruses and organisms were selected
based on their possible presence in respiratory clinical matrix. Exclusivity of the BioFire
COVID-19 Test 2 was evaluated by spiking viruses and organisms at the highest
concentration possible. Each virus/organism was tested in triplicate. All three SARS-CoV-2
assays in each replicate were expected to be negative and any invalid runs due to failure of
controls or instrument/software errors were to be repeated.
It was noted that there was one study deviation in that a commercial source of bocavirus was
not available for testing. In lieu of a commercial stock, an archived clinical sample (NPS)
positive for bocavirus was tested that was previously evaluated using the FilmArray
Respiratory Panel. This sample appeared to be a high positive and thus was diluted 10-fold in
sterile saline for further evaluation in this study by the subject device.
A total of 124 FilmArray system runs were initiated and completed successfully (124/124;
100%), where the run were initiated on the FilmArray 2.0 and FilmArray Torch instruments
in equal proportion (i.e., 62 FilmArray 2.0, 62 FilmArray Torch). Further 29 viruses, 43
bacteria, and 5 Fungi were evaluated with the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 device.
A summary of the cross-reactivity evaluation is as follows. No cross-reactivity was detected
for the various analytes (i.e., 0/3 detection for each assay/replicate/analyte).

in silico Exclusivity Analysis
Exclusivity alignment
in silico analyses were performed to evaluate any non-specific or off-target amplification that
may occur during the out (PCR1) and/or inner (PCR2) reactions. Exclusivity of near-
neighbor Coronaviridae species was evaluated by MAFFT alignment of available NCBI
genomes. Alignment of 1,124 genomes were assessed representing relevant human
Coronaviridae and other near neighbors, including bat coronaviruses. All primers were
mapped to the reference sequence and the binding region was extracted and sorted by percent
homology to the reference.

Exclusivity alignment indicated that individual COVID-19 primers show greater than or
equal to 80% homology to one or more exclusivity genome of the Coronaviridae family.
However, a detection result is not expected by the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 device for the
majority of these interactions because it would take both PCR2 primers to have 80%
homology or greater for an assay detection. Nevertheless, it is possible that cross-reactivity
of individual primers could interfere with PCR reactions by sequestering reagents needed for
efficient amplification of targets. To address this risk of reduced sensitivity, the BioFire
COVID-19 Test 2 includes an excess of primer in the reaction.
Only two exclusivity genomes showed homology to assay specific primer sets and are
predicted to be detected by the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 device. They included—Bat
coronavirus RaTG13 (accession #MN996532) and Pangolin coronavirus isolate MP789
(accession #MT084071). The Bat coronavirus RaTG13 is the closes relative to the SARS-
CoV-2 with an overall genome sequence identity near 96%. The Pangolin coronavirus
MP789 shows 80% or greater homology to multiple COVID-19 Test 2 primers but is only
predicted to be detected by the SARS-CoV-2e assay. No other significant amplification of
non-target sequences is predicted.
Primer BLAST analysis
Specificity against relevant non-target organisms was evaluated using the BLAST algorithm
with primer pairs. Since the FilmArray assay detection is based on efficient amplification
from PCR1 and PCR2 reactions, organisms outside the Coronaviridae are not expected to
have 80% homology to the nested primer pairs that comprise the device assays. However,
because detection results are generated by the fluorescence of the inner PCR2 reaction, inner
primer pairs were further assessed in silico using the NCBI primer BLAST tool. All
combinations of PCR2 primers for a given assay were analyzed (i.e., forward/reverse,
forward/forward, and reverse/reverse). Additional parameters were evaluated to allow more
thorough BLAST assessment to include results with 80% or greater homology to one or both
primers. Predicted amplicons greater than 1000bp were excluded on the basis that the device
does not allow efficient production of such product length. The NCBI BLAST nr database
was used in this analysis.
As a result of the BLAST alignment, exclusivity genomes identified are not considered to be
concerning as the potential target amplicons are between 700-850bp and exceed the typical
size that the FilmArray device would amplify (i.e., 100-200bp). Further, BLAST alignment
had identified human genomic DNA as a potential amplified target with the primers. But the
potential for cross-reactivity was actually evaluated experimentally in negativity testing with
nasopharyngeal swabs specimens.
Overall, the in silico analysis indicated that only two exclusivity genomes showed significant
homology to assay-specific PCR2 primer sets and thus predicted to be detected by the
BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 device. However, the two identified isolates are not anticipated to
be found in clinical NPS specimens. At present, little is known about the potential of these
exclusivity species to infect a human host or their evolutionary relationship to SARS-CoV-2.
No other significant amplification of non-target sequences is predicted.
b) Interference
K211079 - Page 21 of 36

--- Page 22 ---
Potential interference was evaluated by comparing BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 results from
contrived samples of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical NPS matrix at LoD concentration to results
from samples with the same analyte composition but including a potential interfering
substance. Three replicates of each potential interferrent were evaluated. The concentrations
of substances tested were selected to represent normal to high levels and exceed what may be
present in clinical specimens. Reproducible control failures or loss of analyte detection in the
presence of test substances may be indicative of possible interference.
The primary data for evaluation from this study were the Pass/Fail results for the pouch
control assays and the Detected/Not Detected results for the analyte. An unexpected result
was defined as a control failure or unexpected replicate negative or positive analyte result.
An unexpected result in a single replicate (1/3) indicated the need for testing two additional
replicates. If ≥2/3 or ≥2/5 unexpected results were observed the substance may be interfering;
retesting at the same interfering substance concentration and additional testing at lower test
substance concentrations were performed to determine at what concentration interference is
no longer observed. Note that SARS-COV-2 was spiked at 1x LoD.
The following table provides a list of potentially interfering substances and the observed
results—

Not applicable; this is a qualitative assay.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Assay Controls
Two process controls are included in each BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 pouch:
RNA Process Control
The RNA Process Control assay targets an RNA transcript from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces
pombe. The yeast is present in the pouch in a freeze-dried form and becomes rehydrated when
sample is loaded. The control material is carried through all stages of the test process, including
lysis, nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, PCR1, dilution, PCR2, and DNA melting. A
positive result indicates that all steps carried out in the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 pouch were
successful.

The PCR2 Control assay detects a DNA target that is dried into wells of the array along with the
corresponding primers. A positive result indicates that PCR2 was successful.
Both control assays must be positive for the test run to pass. If any of the controls fail, the
user is instructed to re-run the sample using a new pouch.
Specimen Stability
Specimens should be stored at the following conditions: up to 4 hours ambient (15-30˚C), up to
3 days refrigerated (2-8˚C), and up to 30 days frozen (≤ -15˚C).
A study was performed to evaluate the claimed storage conditions for specimens and likely
encountered during standard of care testing. Ten specimens contrived by spiking pooled residual
NPS specimens with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 at 3x, 5x, and 10x LoD. Each contrived specimen
was tested immediately as the control, then aliquoted and stored under the different storage
conditions corresponding to specimen storage claims. Storage conditions were evaluated at each
time point based on the detection rate and identification of any concerning trends in detection.
Detailed documentation concerning NPS in saline sample storage and transport regarding the
stability of SARS-CoV-2 in that media was provided. It was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 was
stable in NPS specimens collected in saline for up to 4 hours at ambient temperature (30 °C), 3
days refrigeration, and 30 days frozen. The stability of SARS-CoV-2 in NPS specimens collected
in saline had been previously demonstrated using the FilmArray system.
Overall, the recommended specimen storage conditions for the device appear to follow from the
various evaluations of the FilmArray systems, including the detection of all replicates according
to the acceptance criteria in the analytical study at the different contrived sample concentrations,
temperature, and corresponding storage duration.
Fresh vs. Frozen Study
A fresh vs. frozen study was not performed separately for this device but detailed
documentation for NPS in VTM specimens had been previously included in other
submissions involving the FilmArray systems (e.g., K103175, K110764, K120267). Further,
frozen archived clinical samples were not used to supplement clinical and/or analytical study
data for the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 device.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) in NPS was determined using infectious and heat inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020) spiked into unique clinical NPS specimens in transport
medium. LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that can be detected
at a rate of at least 95% (19/20 runs). Tentative LoD was determined using three-fold dilutions of
quantified infectious virus. Subsequently, the tentative LoD was confirmed by testing additional
replicates to demonstrate a ≥95% detection rate at LoD, and a <95% detection rate at 0.1×LoD.
The LoD evaluation was performed using the FilmArray 2.0 system.
To evaluate the potential effects of variable clinical sample matrix on analyte detection, all
testing in this study was performed using individual NPS specimens in transport media
previously collected from patients suspected of having respiratory disease. Virus stock

dilutions (infectious or heat activated) were prepared in saline and subsequently spiked into
unique NPS specimens in transport media for testing with the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2
device.
Infectious SARS-CoV-2 LoD
For the tentative LoD, four replicates were tested for seven 3-fold serial dilution starting at
3.3E+04 genomic copies (GC)/mL. The following table shows the test results in the tentative
LoD study for infectious SARS-CoV-2, including the Detection result for the three individual
SARS-CoV-2 assays—

Rate
All 20 replicates tested at 3.3E+02 GC/mL had a Detected result for SARS-CoV-2 and
therefore, LoD confirmation testing continued at 10-fold lower. The detection rate at
3.3E+01 GC/mL was only 87.5% or less than the confirmed LoD acceptance criteria.
Therefore, the LoD was confirmed at 3.3+02 GC/mL for the infectious SARS-CoV-2.
Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 LoD
For the tentative LoD, five replicates were tested for five 3-fold serial dilution starting at
3.3E+03 genomic equivalents (GE)/mL. The following is the result of the tentative LoD
study with heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2—

All 20 replicates tested at 3.3E+02 GE/mL returned “Detected” results for SARS-CoV-2,
even though there was variable performance at that concentration for the individual assays.
LoD confirmation proceeded with testing twenty replicates at 3.3E+01 GE/mL (0.1x LoD).
Only eight replicates returned a “Detected” result which was <19/20 (0.1x LoD).
Therefore, the LoD was confirmed at 3.3+02 GE/mL for the heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2.

FDA Reference Panel Evaluation
The analytical sensitivity of the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 device was evaluated using the
U.S. FDA SARS-CoV-2 Verification Panel. The verification panel consists of five samples
(T1-T5) containing heat-inactivated strains of SARS-CoV-2 and Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS)-CoV. The study was divided into three types of evaluations—range
finding to obtain an estimate of LoD, confirmation of the LoD, and testing of blinded control
samples. Samples containing MERS-CoV are expected to return “Not Detected” results and

were used to indicate specificity. All testing was performed with pooled negative
nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) as a sample matrix.
During the range-finding part of testing to estimate LoD, serial 10-fold dilutions of one of the
samples on the verification panel was used to span concentrations from 1.8E+06 to 1.8E+00
NDU/mL (where NDU = Nucleic Acid Amplification Test detectable units). Three replicates
at each concentration was evaluated and the lowest concentration at which all three replicates
returned a “Detected” result was selected for further confirmation. The initial estimated,
lowest concentration that met the criteria was 1.8E+03 NDU/mL. This concentration was
further evaluated by testing an additional 17 replicates (total of 20). In addition, 20 replicates
at concentrations 3-fold above and 3-fold below the target concentration was also evaluated.
In addition, four blinded samples were evaluated according to the supplied protocol. The
protocol instructed the dilutions of panel samples that should be evaluated in five replicates
each. Further, the firm was instructed to calculate the concentration of blinded samples by
comparing their Detection results to a standard curve determined in the initial range-finding
testing. This was performed solely for the purposes of verifying the panel samples as the
BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 device is qualitative and does not report quantitative values in test
results. These calculations were then reported for the four blinded samples. Based on the
blinded testing results and further review of the reference panel testing, an LoD was adjusted
to the next confirmed concentration from the preliminary assessment of 1.8E+03 NDU/mL.
The LoD according to the FDA reference panel testing was confirmed to be 5.4E+03
NDU/mL. No cross-reactivity with MERS-CoV was reported.
7. Analytical Reactivity:
In silico Inclusivity Analysis
An in silico evaluation of primer sequences in the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 device was
performed periodically to track any variants appearing in the primer binding regions as more
SARS-CoV-2 sequences became available.
BioFire Defense employs a custom bioinformatics tool to monitor inclusivity of assay primer
regions in emerging global variants of the target pathogen, and to therefore mitigate any
potential risks that these variants may have on device performance. In essence, the tool
compares primer binding regions to corresponding regions on the reference sequence and
classifies any changes in a binning function. The binning function helps identify perfect
matches, mismatches, and deletions (accounting for mutation type, nucleotide change,
location, and affected primer), and also sequences with ambiguities in the primer region. This
classification scheme with the binning function facilitates identifying variant frequencies as
results are captured into a database for continual updating and querying.
Overall, two key criterion are employed in the variant monitoring. First, only variants
occurring at or above 0.1% frequency of the total sequences collected quarterly are
considered to filter out possible sequencing errors, rare genotypes, or variants without
competitive advantage. Second, sequences that meet the first criteria are further filtered out
for variants that do not fall within 10bp of the 3’ end of the primer.

Global in silico analysis (as of August, 2021) by BioFire Defense predicted that the BioFire
COVID-19 Test 2 SARS-CoV-2 assays will detect all 497,598 sequences evaluated. The
analysis included all Variants of Interest (VOIs) and Variants of Concern (VOCs), as defined
by the WHO on June 1, 2021 (https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-sars-cov-2-variants)

In addition, BioFire Defense indicated that one mutation passes the 5% frequency threshold
of representation in the sequence database that may signify increased public health risk with
the variant However, due to the position on the primer , the mutation is not expected to
affect assay performance nor overall device performance. It appears that the mutation is
mostly associated with the “Alpha” Variant of Concern (i.e., B.1.1.7).
Overall, the firm indicated that through the in silico analysis, among the 497,598 sequences
analyzed (as of August 2021), there appears to be no examples of variant lineages that the
BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 device will not be detected either by a single assay or overall test
result.
Inclusivity Empirical Analysis
The inclusivity in detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants by the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2
device was further evaluated through empirical evaluation of particular strains. Five variants
of infectious SARS-CoV-2 were spiked in pooled NPS at concentrations near LoD. One of
the variants evaluated was the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 reference strain. The other

b Reference variant.
c 9.9E+02 GC/mL is 3-fold greater than the LoD determined for infectious material
(Table 11). Unexpected dropouts of the SARS-CoV-2e assay and a review of the
amplification data suggested that spike levels (for all variants evaluated in this study)
were lower than 3×LoD and closer to 1×LoD.
The inclusivity evaluation started at 9.9E+02 GC/mL (3x LoD) of the SARS-CoV-2 USA-
WA1/2020 reference variant to verify reliable detection at the concentration. The New York-
PV08410/2020 variant had three SARS-CoV-2 Detected results for all three replicates tested
at a concentration that was 3-fold above the concentration assessed for the other variants
including USA-WA1/2020 reference strain. Additional assessments of the observed detection
results as compared to those observed with the reference strain during LoD confirmation
studies suggested that the actual concentration evaluated of the various variants may have
been much less than 1x LoD. The amplicon Tm values for each variant fell within the Tm
range of each SARS-CoV-2 assay.
Overall, all four SARS-CoV-2 variants that were empirically tested were detected at levels
within 3-fold of the USA-WA1/2020 reference variant and no sensitivity limitations
appeared to be observed.

The BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 is part of the FilmArray system. The FilmArray system is
designed to interpret the test data and automatically report the test results to the operator. The
FilmArray system uses the results of the melt detector to determine each test result. The melt
detector analyzes the fluorescence signal for each DNA melt curve using a series of
mathematical tests or filters. These tests evaluate the melt curves and their derivatives and
determine the presence or absence of specific PCR products from background noise or other
non-specific products. Each test uses specific cutoff thresholds (established during tuning) to
determine if a curve is positive or negatives. Once a curve is assigned a results (positive or
negative) no further tests are performed, otherwise analysis continues until a determination
can be made by the software. To maximize the sensitivity and specific of the melt detector,
the algorithm was tuned against a large data set comprising typical and atypical melt curves
(i.e., training data set) with expert annotation (positive or negative) to each melt curve during
the development of the device. Using an automated process, the melt detector algorithm was
then tuned so that software calls most closely matched those from expert users.
The BioFire FilmArray melt detector was tuned using data from runs performed both at the
firm and at external sites. The melt detector can be tuned to use different thresholds (or
cutoffs) for each test panel in order to achieve optimal sensitivity and specificity for each
panel. The amplicons generated by the assays contained in BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 are
expected to melt at specific temperatures (Tm). The range of expected Tm values for any
amplicon is affected by system variation and by sequence diversity (e.g., different isolates or
strains of specific target organisms). While effort was made to minimize variation in Tm
values with the assay design of the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 device, some sequence
diversity is expected and thus there are assay specific “melt ranges” to account for potential
variations. For each assay in the device, the Tm value for the PCR2 amplicon is empirically
determined and set as the mean Tm. The appropriate range appropriate range is then
determined by evaluating known sequence diversity using a combination of mathematical
modeling and empiric testing. Data collected when evaluating well-characterized samples
during development including known isolates and clinical samples further established melt
ranges. At the conclusion of analytical and clinical studies, a final validation of melt ranges is
performed to ensure optimal sensitivity and specificity for each assay on the device.
Overall, by using an adjusted model fit to account for empirical observations and primary
reference data, 99.76% of the observed Tm values for assays were within 1 degree of the
predicted Tm values. Thus, the melt ranges were optimized and incorporated into the BioFire
COVID-19 Test 2 pouch module.
9. Carry-Over:
A formal carry-over study in support of this regulatory submission for the BioFire COVID-
19 Test 2 was not performed, since carry-over studies with high positive samples followed by
negative samples have been performed for other FDA-cleared FilmArray Panels (i.e.,
FilmArray RP, BCID, and GI) for both the FilmArray 2.0 and the FilmArray Torch systems.
No detectable carry-over has been observed.

for less than or equal to three days before enrollment (testing must be completed
within this window)
• At least 1.3 mL of specimen is remaining after standard of care testing and is
available for use in the study
Exclusion criteria:
• Specimen other than NPS in transport medium (e.g., nasopharyngeal aspirate, anterior
or mid-turbinate swab, oropharyngeal swab, NPS eluted in saline)
• Specimen cannot be tested within the defined storage parameters
• Insufficient specimen volume
Once specimens met the eligibility criteria, a study code number was assigned to de-identify
aliquots, and sample identities were blinded from test operators and personnel analyzing
results. Laboratory personnel performed testing on the FDA cleared comparator method
(CM) and BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 according to the respective Instructions for Use. Runs
that produced invalid results were retested if there was sufficient specimen volume.
For this study, the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 was evaluated against the comparator. The two
devices have different targeted regions and number of targets and result calling algorithm for
their respective assays to detect the SARS-CoV-2 analyte. Additional EUA tests were used
for discrepancy analysis with the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 device. In this study, a specimen
having agreement between the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 and the comparator are either both
positive (True Positive) or both negative (True Negative, TN). The exact binomial two-sided
95% confidence interval was calculated for both PPA and NPA. Both the FilmArray 2.0 and
the FilmArray Torch instruments were used in the study.
Overall, from the three study sites, a total of 534 specimens were enrolled. Eleven (11/534)
were excluded as indicated below. Seven (7/11) specimens failed the inclusion criteria

--- Page 34 ---
including one specimen where the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2 testing was never attempted
due to insufficient specimen volume for retesting after a CM invalid result. Four specimens
had device failures with the BioFire COVID-19 Test 2.

1 Specimen was negative by SoC test; testing was not attempted on BioFire COVID-
19 Test 2 nor at central reference laboratory.
2 Specimens were negative by SoC, CM, and central reference laboratory test.
Thus for the 527 specimens that met the inclusion criteria and for which pouch loading was
attempted, 524 pouches hydrated and drew sample properly on the first attempt. For the three
failures, hydration and sample loading was reattempted where two were successful and one
reattempt was not successful. In total this translated into a 99.2% success rate in pouch
function. As for instrument performance, for the 526 specimens that were successfully loaded
into pouches, there were three system failures—two incomplete runs and one control failure
for a success rate of 99.4% (523/526).
The study population were comprised of the following demographics—
