III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System is a continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM) device with real time alarms capability indicated for the management of diabetes in
persons age 4 and older. It is intended to replace blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment
decisions, unless otherwise indicated.
The System also detects trends and tracks patterns and aids in the detection of episodes of
hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments.
Interpretation of the System readings should be based on the glucose trends and several
sequential readings over time.
The System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally connected devices.
The System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected devices where the
user manually controls actions for therapy decisions.
The System can be used with the FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor (14 day) or the FreeStyle Libre 2
MediRx Sensor (10 day).
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The System must not be used with automated insulin dosing (AID) systems, including closed
loop, hybrid closed loop, and insulin suspend systems.
Taking ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise
Sensor glucose readings. Inaccurate sensor readings due to ascorbic acid interference may be
clinical significant and result in harm if relied on to make treatement decisions. Taking more that
500 mg of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which could cause you to miss a
severe low glucose event.
The System must be removed prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed
Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The effect of
MRI, CT scans, or diathermy on the performance of the System has not been evaluated. The
exposure may damage the Sensor and may impact proper function of the device which could
cause incorrect readings.
Do not use this system if you are pregnant, on dialysis, or critically ill. The System is not cleared
for use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or medications common to
these populations may affect performance of the System.
Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: if you are experiencing
symptoms that are not consistent with the glucose readings, consult your health care
professional.
Do not use the System in people less than 4 years of age.
K211102 - Page 2 of 21

--- Page 3 ---
Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the "check
blood glucose" symbol during the first 12 hours or wearing a Sensor. In addition, use your blood
glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions, if your Sensor glucose reading does not
match how you feel, or if the reading does not include a number.
Wash application site on the back of your upper arm using a plain soap, dry, and then clea with
an alcohol wipe. This will hep remove any oily residue that may prevent the sensor from sticking
properly. Allow site to air dry before proceeding. Carefully preparing the site according to these
instructions will help the Sensor stay on your body for the full 14-day wear period and help
prevent it from falling off early.
Store the Sensor Kit between 36°F and 82°F. If you suspect that the temperature may exceeed
82°F (e.g., an un-airconditioned home in the summer), you should refridgerate your Sensor Kit.
Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.
You must scan the Sensor to get your real-time current glucose level as the Reader will not
provide this information without a scan.
The Readers's built-in meter is not for use on people who are dehydrated, hypotensive, in shock,
or for individuals in hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state, with or without ketosis.
The Reader's built-in meter is not for use on neonates, in critically-ill patients, or for diagnosis or
screening of diabetes.
Take standard precautions for transmission of blood borne pathogens to avoid contamination.
Use of the Sensor with devices, apps, and software that are not listed by the manufacturer as
compatible with the System may cause inaccuracte glucose readings.
If a Sensor breaks inside a user's body, they should call their health care professional.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System is an integrated continuous glucose
monitoring (iCGM) system that provides continuous glucose measurements every minute to
provide glucose levels, trends, and real-time alarms capability to aid in the management of
diabetes. The FreeStyle Libre 2 System consists of two primary components: a Sensor that
transmits via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and a BLE enabled display device (Reader). User
initiated radiofrequency identification (RFID) scanning of the Sensor via Reader provides the
user with real-time glucose measurements (glucose values) accompanied by trend information
(glucose arrows) and historical glucose information (glucose graph). Users may use the Sensor
glucose results and information provided by the System in making treatment decisions. The
System also provides configurable alarms designed to warn the user of Low Glucose, High
K211102 - Page 3 of 21

--- Page 4 ---
Glucose or Signal Loss. The system is intended for single-patient use at home and requires a
prescription.
FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor
• The Sensor is single use and disposable. The Sensor is provided as two secondary
components, Sensor Applicator and Sensor Pack (sterile device), which are used to
assemble and apply the Sensor to the back of the user’s arm. During Sensor application,
the sensor tail is inserted below the surface of the skin through the guidance of a needle.
The needle is retracted back into the applicator after insertion. The Sensor continuously
measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid every minute and has an 8-hour
memory capacity. The Sensor is factory calibrated and does not require fingerstick
calibration.
FreeStyle Libre 2 Reader
• The Reader is a small handheld device that is powered by a lithium-ion rechargeable
battery and uses RFID communication to start new Sensors and to scan Sensors to display
and record data and uses blue tooth low energy BLE communication to issue alarms that
notify the user to scan his/her sensor when glucose values pass a high or low glucose
threshold. The Reader also has a built-in strip port with blood glucose functionality (that
is intended to work with the FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose test strips, cleared
under K171941), and a user interface that includes event logging features.
The FreeStyle Libre 2 MediRx Sensor with a 10-day wear duration is an alternate configuration
to the existing FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor, which has a 14-day wear duration. The FreeStyle Libre
2 MediRx Sensor design is unchanged from that of the predicate Sensor (the FreeStyle Libre 2
Flash Glucose Monitoring System). The algorithm and Reader design in the FreeStyle Libre 2
MediRx Sensor are also the same as those of the predicate.
As with the predicate, the System is intended to be used when the user utilizes CGM information
to manually control actions for therapy decisions. The System must not be used with automated
insulin dosing (AID) systems, which include full closed loop, hybrid closed loop, and insulin
suspend (e.g., threshold suspend and predictive low glucose suspend) systems.
B Principle of Operation:
The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System uses an electrochemical sensor to
monitor glucose levels in the interstitial fluid (ISF). The sensor is held in place with an adhesive
pad and incorporates both the subcutaneously implanted sensor and associated electronics. The
sensor uses a glucose oxidase enzyme to oxidize glucose and transfer electrons to a metal
electrode, producing a current. The strength of the current is proportional to the amount of
glucose present in the subcutaneous space. The FreeStyle Libre 2 System converts the electrical
current signal to a glucose value (in mg/dL) for display to the user on the handheld Reader.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
For this device and the predicate, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been shown to significantly
interfere with system performance. Analytical Specificity/Interference was previously
assessed in K193371.
Based on the results of the clinical evaluation and bench testing for ascorbic acid, the
following statements have been placed in the device labeling:
• User Manual Warning: Taking ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplements while wearing
the Sensor may falsely raise Sensor glucose readings. Taking more than 500 mg of
ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor readings which could cause you to miss a
severe low glucose event. Ascorbic acid can be found in supplements including
multivitamins. Some supplements, including cold remedies such as Airborne® and
Emergen-C®, may contain high doses of 1000 mg of ascorbic acid and should not be
taken while using the Sensor. See your healthcare professional to understand how
long ascorbic acid is active in your body.
• Reader Screen Warning: Do not take high doses of vitamin C (more than 500 mg per
day). This may falsely raise your Sensor readings. Supplements like Airborne or
Emergen-C have high doses of vitamin C. Read labeling for all supplements to
determine vitamin C content.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The Assay Reportable Range was previously assessed in K193371. The reportable range for
the System with the FreeStyle Libre 2 MediRx Sensor remains unchanged as 40 to 400
mg/dL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The shelf-life of the FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor was previously evaluated in K193371. Both
the FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor and FreeStyle Libre 2 MediRx sensor have a storage shelf life of
9 months. Shelf-life was evaluated at 36° - 82° Fahrenheit within the humidity range of 10%
- 90%.
6. Detection Limit:
If a glucose measurement is less than 40 mg/dL, the result will be displayed by the system as
‘LO’. If the glucose measurement exceeds 400 mg/dL, the result will be displayed as ‘HI’.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable.
9. Carry-Over:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not applicable. Accuracy is determined by comparing device values to an FDA-cleared
laboratory glucose measurement method and was previously assessed in K193371.
2. Matrix Comparison:
Not applicable. Interstitial fluid is the only indicated matrix.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
2. Clinical Specificity:
See Section A(3), Analytical Specificity/Interference, above.
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Two prospective clinical studies were conducted in the United States to support clearance of
the predicate device in K193371.
In both studies, accuracy of the FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor was evaluated by comparing iCGM
glucose values to an FDA-cleared laboratory grade comparator method (CM, using the YSI
2300). Glucose values were obtained from the iCGM and from the comparator at the same or
similar time. The accuracy of iCGM glucose versus the comparator method was assessed by
K211102 - Page 9 of 21

--- Page 10 ---
calculating the percentage of iCGM readings that were within 15%, 20%, and 40% for
reference values ≥70 mg/dL, and within 15 mg/dL, 20 mg/dL, and 40 mg/dL for values < 70
mg/dL. For glucose values < 70 mg/dL, the difference in mg/dL between the CGM and
comparator glucose values was calculated. For values ≥70 mg/dL, the relative difference (%)
to the comparator value was calculated.
The study data was reanalyzed to include data from the first 10 days of sensor wear, to align
with the proposed intended use of the System with the FreeStyle Libre 2 MediRx Sensor. The
sponsor did not collect paired glucose data on Day 10 due to the clinic visit schedule for both
studies. Therefore, paired CGM-CM data up to Day 9 are presented in the tables below.
Assessment of Day 12 data (where paired CGM-CM data are available) indicates that the
performance data below is representative of the device performance for 10 days of wear.

Trend Accuracy
Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose
and is characterized by slopes, such as from > 2mg/dL/min to <-2 mg/dL/min. Trend
accuracy was assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change from the iCGM
and the corresponding comparator values for each iCGM-comparator measurement pair.

Agreement when iCGM Reads ‘LO’ or ‘HI’
The System reports glucose readings between 40 and 400 mg/dL. When the System
determines that glucose level is below 40 mg/dL, it will display ‘LO’ whenever the sensor is
scanned. When the System determines that glucose level is above 400 mg/dL, it will display
‘HI’ whenever the sensor is scanned. Because the system does not display glucose values
below 40 mg/dL or above 400 mg/dL, the comparisons to the actual blood glucose levels (as
determined by the comparator) when the iCGM value is classified as ‘LO’ or ‘HI’ are
evaluated separately. The cumulative percentages of when the comparator values were less
than certain glucose values (for ‘LO’) and when comparator values were more that certain
glucose values (for ‘HI’) are presented in the tables below.

Alarm Performance
The tables in this section show the accuracy of the System’s Low and High Glucose Alarms.
The Alarm Rate tells the user how often the alarm is right or wrong. The Detection Rate tells
the user how often the System is able to recognize and notify the user about a low or high
glucose event (within 15 minutes before or after the event).
Low Glucose Alarm Performance
True Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was below the
alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.
False Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was not below the
alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.
Detection Rate: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the alarm
issued within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.
Missed Detection Rate: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the
alarm didn’t issue within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.

Sensor Accuracy Over Time
Sensor accuracy over time (sensor stability) describes the performance of the sensor over the
sensor lifetime. The FreeStyle Libre 2 MediRx sensor can be worn for up to 10 days.
Performance was estimated by calculating the mean of the absolute relative differences
between iCGM and comparator measurement and percentage of device readings within 15
mg/dL or 15% (15/15%), 20 mg/dL or 20% (20/20%) and 40 mg/dL or 40% (40/40%) of the
comparator values during the beginning, middle, and end of the wear period. These times
were defined as follows:
• Beginning (Adult Days 1-3, Pediatric: Days 1-2)
• Middle (Adult: Days 7-8, Pediatric: Days 7-8),
• End (Adult: Day 9, Pediatric: Day 9).
The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and agreement rates with the comparator
method were evaluated over 10-day life of the sensor.

Sensor Life
To estimate how long a Sensor will work for the 10-day wear duration, 146 Sensors were
evaluated in the Adult study and 139 Sensors were evaluated in the Pediatric study to
determine how many days of readings each Sensor provided. Subjects did not wash the
insertion site with soap and water before applying the Sensors and wore two Sensors
simultaneously. Of the 146 Sensors in the Adult study, 82.2% lasted 10 days. In the Pediatric
study, 89.9% of the Sensors lasted 10 days.

A third clinical study was also conducted to further evaluate wear duration in subjects who
first washed the insertion site with a plain soap and water, according to the full instructions in
the labeling and wore only a single Sensor. A total of 39 Sensors were evaluated in this
study, all the Sensors (100%) lasted 10 days.
Glucose Reading Availability
The System is designed to show a Sensor glucose reading after each scan that is performed
throughout the wear period after the start-up time. As such, the capture rate characterizes the
reliability of the communication between components of the system.
