in clinical laboratories as an in vitro test to determine the susceptibility of clinically significant
aerobic Gram-negative bacilli to antimicrobial agents when used as instructed.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Limitation:
Perform and alternative method of testing prior to reorting or results for the following
antibiotic/organism combination(s): Imipenem/Relebactam: Serratia marcescens
D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using VITEK 2 Systems 9.03 software
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
K211136 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Imipenem/Relebactam has the following concentrations of
imipenem/relebactam in the card: 0.25/4, 1/4, 4/4, and 16/4 μg/mL (equivalent standard method
concentration by efficacy in μg/mL); the content of relebactam is fixed at 4 µg/mL in each
dilution. The imipenem/relebactam MIC result range for the VITEK 2 is ≤0.25/4 to ≥16/4
μg/mL. For Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex, the VITEK 2 system is capable of
reporting the following MIC results: ≤0.25/4, 0.5/4, 1/4, 2/4, 4/4, 8/4 and ≥16/4 μg/mL for the
AST-Gram Negative Imipenem/relebactam test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Testing of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex isolates with the VITEK 2 AST-
Gram Negative Imipenem/Relebactam took place at the time of testing Enterobacterales and
P. aeruginosa isolates in support of clearance of K193572. The QC results were acceptable.
At the time of testing for K193572, the CLSI recommended QC strains, K. pneumoniae
ATCC BAA-1705 and K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-2814 were tested a sufficient number of
times (at least 20 times/site) using both the VITEK 2 card and the broth microdilution
(BMD) reference method. Because of the device design, the acceptable MIC ranges for
CLSI-recommended QC strains were partially off-scale. Therefore, there was a need to
validate a new QC strain to satisfy the QC requirements. The sponsor conducted a study to
validate a novel P. aeruginosa strain (bioMérieux strain 105617) for use as an on-scale QC
strain for imipenem/relebactam. The strain subsequently was submitted to ATCC and is
cataloged as P. aeruginosa ATCC BAA-3144. Testing with this strain under K193572
provided results within the expected QC range for >95% of tests.
Subsequent to the clearance of K193572, the expected QC range for the CLSI-recommended
strain K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-2814 was modified from a range of 0.06/4 – 0.25/4
µg/mL to a range of 0.06 – 0.5/4 µg/mL (change first implemented in CLSI document M100
30th Edition). The results obtained with this QC strain during testing for K193572 reanalyzed
using the revised expected QC range are shown in Table 1 below.

b The lowest concentration of imipenem/relebactam on the VITEK 2 card is 0.25/4 µg/mL. Obtaining
this value was considered an indicator that the quality control test results were acceptable. The
sponsor included a footnote to the Quality Control table indicating that the VITEK 2 AST-Gram
Negative Imipenem/Relebactam panel does not include the full CLSI-recommended dilution range
for QC testing with this organism.
Integrity Check: In support of clearance of K193572 K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-1705 was
tested with imipenem alone as in integrity check for the plasmid encoding the β-lactamase
gene.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Testing of imipenem/relebactam with isolates belonging to the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-
baumannii complex was performed at three external sites and one internal site. Results
obtained with VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Imipenem/Relebactam were compared to
results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution reference panel. The MIC result range for
the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Imipenem/Relebactam is ≤0.25/4 to ≥16/4 µg/mL for all
species. The testing conditions for the reference method consisted of the following:
• Medium – Cation Adjusted Mueller Hinton broth
• Inoculum – Direct colony suspension
• Incubation - 35° C, 16 to 24 hours
The VITEK 2 cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test
inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using
the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 32 clinical isolates of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex. were
evaluated: 9 isolates (28.1%) were considered contemporary isolates and 23 (71.9%) were
stock isolates. Isolates included: Acinetobacter baumannii (20 isolates), and Acinetobacter
baumannii complex (12 isolates). In addition, 24 challenge isolates of Acinetobacter
calcoaceticus-baumannii complex were evaluated. Isolates included: Acinetobacter
baumannii (10 isolates), Acinetobacter baumannii complex (13 isolates) and Acinetobacter
calcoaceticus (1 isolate).
For Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex evaluated using VITEK 2 and
autodilution, the combined clinical and challenge EA and CA were acceptable at 98.2% with
all errors being minor (i.e. no major or very major errors). A total of 35 resistant strains were
evaluated demonstrating the ability of the assay to detect resistance in this complex. (Table

Essential agreement (EA) occurs when the result of the reference method and that of the VITEK 2 AST-Gram
Negative imipenem/relebactam are within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable
results are those that are on-scale for both the reference method and the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative
imipenem/relebactam. Category agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference
method agrees exactly with the interpretation provided by VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Meropenem
For Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex evaluated using manual dilution with
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact, EA and CA were acceptable at 100% with no major, very

include S. marcescens as a species for which the drug was shown to have in vitro and clinical
activity. Testing of S. marcescens showed low performance on VITEK 2 systems. To address

MIC Trending
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method for each organism group. This trending calculation
takes into account MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions
lower or higher than the reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values are
on-scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution
higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered int the
trending analysis.
Organism groups for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs.
lower readings was > 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined to be
statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that showed
higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in the labeling.
Evaluation of results for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii Complex using autodilution
on VITEK 2 showed that a majority of isolates provided MICs were not evaluable for
trending due to the majority of the data being off-scale; however, the few evaluable results
indicate a trend toward lower MIC results with the limited number of isolates available for
trending analysis. (Table 4).

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GN Imipenem/relebactam when revised breakpoints
for imipenem/relebactam are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change
protocol included with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will
update the imipenem/relebactam device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated
performance section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new
breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
