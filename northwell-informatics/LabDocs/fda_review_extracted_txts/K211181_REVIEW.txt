Idylla™ MSI Test K211181 Biocartis NV
The Idylla MSI Test, for use on the Idylla System, uses formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue sections of human colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor, from which nucleic acids
are liberated, then analyzed using PCR amplification of seven monomorphic biomarkers
(ACVR2A, BTBD7, DIDO1, MRE11, RYR3, SEC31A and SULF2) and subsequent melt-
curve analysis. The Idylla MSI Test reports results as either microsatellite stable (MSS),
or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) or invalid.
Idylla MSI Test is indicated for use by healthcare professionals for the qualitative
identification of microsatellite instability (MSI) in CRC tumors, indicative of mismatch
repair deficiency, as an aid in the identification of potential Lynch syndrome to help
identify patients that would benefit from additional genetic testing to diagnose Lynch
syndrome.
The Results from the Idylla MSI Test should be interpreted by healthcare professionals in
conjunction with other clinical findings, family history, and other laboratory data. The
Idylla MSI Test should not be used for diagnosis of CRC.
The clinical performance of this device to guide treatment decision for MSI high patients
has not been established.

IV. Device Description
1. Principle of Operation
The Idylla MSI Test is an automated test on the Idylla System. The Biocartis Idylla System
covers the entire process from sample to result with fully integrated sample preparation
followed by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and fluorescence
detection of the targeted sequences. The Idylla System consists of the Idylla Console connected
to up to eight Idylla Instruments. Idylla Cartridges, designed for specific applications, are
processed by the Idylla System using test specific software. The test specific software, referred
to as Test Type Package (TTP), is available for download to the Idylla Console. The Test
procedure and data analysis are validated for FFPE tissue sections.
The Idylla MSI Test detects a novel panel of seven monomorphic biomarkers which are listed
in the Table 1 below.

The process steps in the Idylla MSI Test are:
• Sample Processing (FFPE liquefaction and cell lysis): After insertion of the FFPE tissue
section into the cartridge, a combination of chemical reagents, enzymes, heat, and high
intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) induces deparaffinization, disruption of the tissue and
lysis of the cells. The nucleic acids are liberated for subsequent PCR amplification. There
is no DNA extraction step in the procedure.
• Amplification, Detection and Analysis: All necessary PCR reagents are present in a stable
formulation and are used to amplify seven biomarkers. After amplification of the specific
regions of the seven (7) biomarkers, the molecular beacons bind to the target regions.
Contact quenching no longer takes place and the beacons will produce a fluorescence
signal. These mutant-specific beacons differentially melt from the wild type or mutated
amplicons with increasing temperature. The fluorescence differences at melting
temperatures are further analyzed by the MSI TTP and translated into genetic calls on
biomarker level and MSI status on sample level.
• Reporting: At the end of the run, a result report outlining the MSI status along with the
number of positive MSI biomarkers detected in the analyzed sample is displayed on the
console screen. The MSI status of the sample can be determined if at least five valid
marker-specific fluorescence profiles could be fully analyzed (otherwise the MSI status is
called ‘Invalid’). The presence of at least two mutant markers results in an ‘MSI-H’ call
(Microsatellite Instability-High), otherwise the status is reported as ‘MSS’ (Microsatellite
Stable).
2. Specimen Handling/Requirement
Standard formalin-fixation and paraffin-embedding procedures should be followed. Tissue
samples should be fixed as quickly as possible and fixation times limited to preferably less
than 72 hours to reduce the risk of severe DNA fragmentation. 4 µm to 10 µm FFPE tissue

sections can be used as specimen in the Idylla MSI Test. Specimens should be
macrodissected if less than 33% of the section is tumor.
3. Interpretation of Results
The Idylla System automatically interprets the test results and makes them available for
viewing on the Console. The Idylla MSI Test reports a result for the MSI status of the sample,
the MSI Score Range of the sample, the number of positive biomarkers and an overall quality
status. A sample is called Microsatellite Instability-High or MSI-H if the sample has ≥2 mutant
biomarkers and an MSI Score Range ≥ 0.15. A sample is called Microsatellite Stable or MSS
if the sample has <2 mutant biomarkers and an MSI Score Range <0.15 (Table 2).
Table 2. Result Interpretation
Number of Positive
MSI Score Range MSI Status
Biomarkers
<2 <0.15 MSS
≥2 ≥0.15 MSI-H
An ‘Invalid’ call for a biomarker is observed when no PCR product was formed in a particular
sample and therefore no characteristic fluorescent profile could be analyzed. This may occur
when using poor quality samples. A Cartridge is considered valid if ≥ 5 out of 7 MSI
biomarkers show a valid marker result for the sample. An invalid Cartridge will report the MSI
status being 'Invalid'. An 'Invalid' result is reported if >2 out of 7 MSI biomarkers show an
invalid biomarker result for a particular sample (Table 3).

** While reproducibility for this marker across 36 replicates is > 85%, the biomarker call observed is discordant to the
biomarker status of the clinical sample that was obtained during sample characterization.
All three sites generated correct MSI status calls across the sites for all seven clinical
samples tested (Table 7). The reproducibility across 36 replicates for each biomarker per
sample is between 77.8 and 100%, for some occasions a biomarker call is observed that is
discordant to the initial biomarker status of the clinical sample (** indicated in Table 8).

4. Analytical Sensitivity
4.1 Limit of Blank
The limit of blank (LoB) study was conducted to evaluate the non-specific amplification
and cross-reactivity between the mutant and wild type targets and consisted of two parts.
Part 1: The no template control (NTC) study wherein the level of contamination with
human DNA was determined in MSI cartridges produced in the manufacturing facilities.
Part 2: Wild Type (WT) study wherein the background signals caused by potential
cross-reactivity of the MSI mutation amplicons with MSI WT DNA were evaluated.
For the NTC study, 60 cartridges from three lots were tested to examine the
contamination in the investigational use only (IUO) MSI Test cartridges. The results
obtained from NTC study were calculated for the proportion of invalid calls (# of
invalid/60). For the WT study, 20 FFPE MSS clinical samples were tested in duplicate
using three different lots of IUO MSI Test cartridges to evaluate the analytical
specificity of the test.
The LoB study results demonstrate that the Idylla MSI Test can correctly generate an
‘Invalid’ MSI status call when there is no sample in the Cartridge and the MSI status
‘MSS’ when a wild type sample is tested with the Idylla MSI Test.
4.2 Limit of Detection
The Limit of Detection (LoD) is defined as the lowest average mutant/total allele ratio
(of weighted combined MSI biomarkers based on prevalence) generating a positive MSI
status in 95% of cases (at a 95% confidence level).
Estimation of LoD with reference samples: The LoD estimation study was performed
using reference cell lines (0% and 100% allelic frequency (AF) samples), by a titration
experiment using varying levels of MSI-H allelic frequency (5% - 50%) at two different
sample input levels (high and low input) representative for clinical samples. This study
result showed the estimated LoD was 30% allelic frequency, at which the Idylla MSI
Test generated correct MSI status calls for all the biomarkers (Table 11 and 12).

Clinical LoD estimation: The LoD using clinical samples was estimated using four
FFPE samples by a titration experiment using varying levels of MSI-H neoplastic cell
content (5-50%). The call rates for sample 4 were variable: this sample had a droplet
digital PCR (ddPCR) measurement which was well below the validated linear range of
the ddPCR method before dilutions were made. This sample was also originally
characterized as a challenging sample with only 2 positive markers. Therefore, the call
rate for this sample could also be indicative for the performance of challenging samples
(Table 13).

Clinical LOD confirmation: The LOD was confirmed using seven FFPE clinical
samples (MSI-H and MSS including challenging samples) at approximately 33%
neoplastic cell content, and the minimum required tissue level (25 mm² per 10 μm
section). The samples were tested across two Cartridge lots in ten replicates per lot
(n=20) over five days on multiple Instruments (total n=140 from all seven samples). As

Note: ‘mut’ refers to a mutant biomarker and ‘wt’ refers to a wild type biomarker
For MSS samples, individual biomarkers score consistently wild type (Table 16). For
clinical MSI-H samples, a concordance of ≥ 95%-point estimate can be observed for 4
biomarkers (BTBD7, RYR3, ACVR2A and MRE11) across all 4 MSI-H samples. The
remaining biomarkers showed concordance below 95% for some samples. For SEC31A,
two samples had hit rates below 95%, Sample 3 at 85% and Sample 4 at 35%. DIDO1
demonstrated a 70% hit rate in sample 1, and SULF2 demonstrated a hit rate of 65%
with sample 2 (Table 15).

hemoglobin, triglycerides, and paraffin. For hemoglobin and triglycerides, interference was
tested at the highest possible concentration levels (2 mg/mL and 37 mmol/L, respectively).
To assess the paraffin interference, one additional 10 μm paraffin blank section was added
to the cartridge along with the sample. Each sample was tested with an interfering substance
in five replicates using a single lot of Idylla MSI Cartridges. Additionally, the samples were
tested without an interfering substance as a control. The results obtained for each interfering
substance were checked for a correct MSI status call and compared with the control results
(runs without interfering substance) for the proportion (%) of concordance with control
results.

All seven samples tested with interference substances i.e., hemoglobin, triglycerides and
excess paraffin generated correct MSI status calls, showed 100% concordance with control
results (Table 17).
Mucin (i.e., % mucinous cells in FFPE sample) impact on the Idylla MSI Test was evaluated
using nineteen individual FFPE clinical samples with various levels of mucinous cell
content (0% - 60%). These samples included both MSI-H and MSS samples that met sample
requirement criteria for the test. Each mucinous sample was tested in three replicates using
one lot of Idylla MSI Test Cartridges. All nineteen mucinous samples results showed correct
MSI calls for approximately 96.5% runs (55 of 57 runs) performed, except one sample
which generated ‘Invalid’ results for 2 out of 3 runs performed. This study indicated that
samples with mucinous cell content up to 60% have no impact on the performance of the
Idylla MSI Test, and can still generate correct MSI status calls.
The impact of necrosis content >50% on the Idylla MSI Test was evaluated using four FFPE
clinical samples with various levels of necrosis content (66-73%). The samples included
both MSI-H and MSS samples. Each sample was tested in triplicate with and without
necrosis content. All four samples generated a correct MSI status call for testing with and
without necrosis. Therefore, necrosis content up to 73% has no impact on the Idylla MSI
Test.

6. Assay Reportable Range
Seven samples consisting of four MSI-H and three MSS clinical FFPE samples (including
one each of MSI-H and MSS borderline samples) were used for this study. In this study,
borderline samples refer to MSI mutant samples with one positive marker (MSS borderline,
negative) or 2/3 positive markers (MSI-H borderline, positive). The minimum and
maximum tissue requirement was determined by a titration experiment using six different
levels of input material (12.5 mm2 – 300 mm2) per sample using 10 μm FFPE clinical
specimens containing the minimum required tumor content (i.e., ≥ 33%) per the product
requirements. Sufficient FFPE MSI-H/MSS sections from each sample were liquefied using
MSI Test split protocol Part 1, and these liquefactions were diluted with buffer to prepare
the desired six level tissue input samples (300, 200, 100, 50, 25 and 12.5 mm²). Each
dilution sample was tested in six replicates using three different MSI Test cartridge lots.
The results obtained were analyzed for proportion of correct calls and checked against the
acceptance criteria specified in the protocol.
Data analysis showed that overall, the results met the acceptance criteria of ≥95%
concordance (correct MSI status calls) for tissue input levels (mm2) 300, 200, 100, 50, and
25. However, input level 12.5 mm2 did not meet the acceptance criteria with an 85.7 %
(36/42) concordance (correct MSI status calls).
The results demonstrated that the Idylla MSI Test can achieve valid and correct MSI status
calls with tissue input levels from minimum of 25 mm² to maximum of 300 mm² for 10 μm
sections, equivalent for 4 μm sections from minimum of 62.5 mm² to maximum 750 mm²
tissue input.
7. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods)
7.1 Shelf Life
Four verification lots and one validation lot were tested in support of the Idylla MSI Test
shelf life. The product lots were stored at temperatures of 5±3°C and 30±2°C representing
the worst-case scenarios. A limited number of cartridges were stored at temperature of
25±2°C to be tested if the instability trend is observed at 30±2°C (fallback scenario). One
product lot (#3505) was subjected to the mixed thermal program prior to the real time
stability testing as described in the Shipping Stability section.
The real time stability testing results support the current claimed shelf life and the unopened
Idylla MSI Test is stable up to 18 months (Table 18).

7.2 Shipping Stability
Cartridges underwent temperature cycling between -20°C for 72 hours and +25°C for 24
hours across a total of two cycles. The third winter cycle of 48 hours at -20°C and 24 hours
at +25°C hours followed immediately. After completion of winter cycling, the cartridges
were exposed to the temperature of 40°C for 72 hours.
Immediately after temperature cycles, 9 MSI cartridges were tested with 6 FFPE MSI slices
and 3 FFPE MSS slices to generate the time point 0’ data. The reference baseline for data
analysis was time point 0 data (QC release). The cartridges exposed to the thermal cycling
have been stored at 30 ± 2 °C and further tested according to the real time stability study
protocol.
The results show that exposing the Idylla MSI Test to high (up to 40°C) and low
temperatures (to -20°C) for a limited time up to 72 hours does not impact the product
performance.
7.3 In Use Stability
For this study, 84 MSI cartridges were removed from the pouch and kept in the incubator
at 30 ± 2 °C and 75 % RH for 6 days. First 12 cartridges were removed from the incubator

after two hours (= day 0) and tested with 6 MSI-H samples and 6 MSS samples. The
remaining cartridges were run on day 1 to 6 (six cartridges per day). In-use stability study
(without pouch, without specimen) is verified at the beginning (within 3 months after T0)
and at the end of shelf life.
For in-use study 1, MSI cartridges were removed from their pouches and placed in an
incubator (at 30 ± 2 °C and 75 ± 5 %RH) for up to 6 days. The first cartridges were tested
with MSS and MSI FFPE slices after 2 hours (= day 0) in the incubator, and the remaining
cartridges were tested at the 5 subsequent time points, i.e., day 2 to day 6. Six cartridges
were tested per time point: 3 cartridges with FFPE MSS slices and 3 cartridges with FFPE
MSI slices.
For In-use study 2, MSI cartridges were removed from their pouches, loaded with a MSS
FFPE slice or MSI slice. Six cartridges loaded with the two input sample types were run on
Idylla immediately after the sample was loaded (hour 0). The other loaded cartridges were
placed in an incubator (at 30 ± 2 °C and 75 ± 5 %RH) for 3 and 9 hours before running them
on Idylla. Six cartridges were tested per time point: 3 cartridges with FFPE MSS slices and
3 cartridges with FFPE MSI slices.
The in-use stability data obtained at beginning and end of shelf life support that MSI
cartridges can be used up to:
• 5 days after removed from the pouch and stored on the bench (at laboratory ambient
conditions) without sample
• 8 hours after removed from pouch, loaded with a sample and stored at laboratory
ambient conditions.
8. Assay Cut-Off
Seven novel individual MSI markers (ACVR2A, BTBD7, DIDO1, MRE11, RYR3,
SEC31A and SULF2) will be tested.
• A sample is called Microsatellite Instability-High or MSI-H if the sample has ≥2
mutant biomarkers and an MSI Score Range ≥ 0.15.
• A sample is called Microsatellite Stable or MSS if the sample has <2 mutant
biomarkers and an MSI Score Range <0.15.
9. Cartridge Accuracy for Minimal Number of Expansions
The test panel to assess cartridge accuracy consisted of synthetic targets (ST), representing
all seven MSI biomarkers, containing the repeat sequence with one additional nucleotide
(+1) or one deleted nucleotide (-1). Both reference sample and spiked MSS samples were
tested in triplicate in cartridges resulting from one cartridge lot (Table 19).

All nine Idylla runs resulted in valid test results. Three cartridges tested with the control
panel, MSS contrived sample, resulted in an MSS call. Three cartridges tested with MSS
sample spiked with ST cocktail 1 (-1 nucleotide) resulted in an MSI-H call. Cartridges tested
with MSS sample spiked with ST cocktail 2 (+1 nucleotide) resulted in three MSS calls
(Table 20).
10. Carry-Over
The Idylla MSI Test is a unitized cartridge test system. Therefore, this study is not
applicable.
11. Curls versus Slides of FFPE Specimens
Ten paired (curls and slides) FFPE MSS and ten paired (curls and slides) FFPE MSI-H
samples from CRC patients that fulfilled the sample requirements per Idylla MSI Test
Instructions For Use were tested. A total of 40 samples (20 curls and 20 slides) were tested.
The agreement of the final MSI status (genetic) call results between curls and slides for each
sample tested (10 MSS and 10 MSI-H) were compared.
The data analysis revealed that of the 20 samples tested (10 MSS and 10 MSI-H), one MSI-
H sample had discordant results between curl and slide, and the remaining 19 samples
showed agreement for results between curls and slides.
B. Comparison Studies:
A method comparison study was conducted to clinically validate the accuracy of the Idylla MSI
Test against a predicate device, the OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System for the detection of
MSI status. A comparison of the Idylla MSI Test result to results of a germline Next Generation
Sequencing (NGS) for DNA mismatch repair genes (MMR) was performed for identification
of Lynch syndrome (LS) cases.

Idylla™ MSI Test K211181 Biocartis NV
The study was conducted by testing 123 sequentially enrolled colorectal samples representative
of the intended use population. The sequential sample set was supplemented with 20 confirmed
Lynch cases (enrichment cohort) obtained from the Colorectal Cancer Family Registry (CCFR).
The study used retrospective FFPE tissue samples collected from CRC patients in the US
representative of the intended use population. All stages of CRC (stages I – IV), and tumors
from different sites of the colorectal area were represented.
Of the total 143 samples included in the study (123 sequential and 20 confirmed Lynch), valid
test results were obtained for all 143 with Idylla MSI Test, for 140 with the predicate and 133
with germline NGS of MMR genes.
The agreement parameters PPA, NPA and OPA were calculated between Idylla MSI Test and
the predicate for MSI status calls and between Idylla MSI Test and germline NGS of MMR
genes for Lynch identification.
1. Idylla MSI Test vs Predicate
The concordance and agreement analysis between Idylla MSI Test and the predicate for the 143
samples is presented in Table 21 and Table 22, respectively. A total of 32 samples were detected
as MSI-H by the predicate out of which 31 were also detected as MSI-H by the Idylla MSI Test.
Of the total 108 samples detected as MSS by the predicate, 107 were also MSS by Idylla MSI
Test. The PPA was 96.88% and the NPA was 99.07% with OPA of 98.57% between the two
methods.

The analysis demonstrated the agreement of the Idylla MSI Test with the predicate device, the
predicate to detect MSI status from samples collected from CRC patients representative of the
intended use population.
2. Idylla MSI Test Vs Germline NGS for MMR Genes
Based on the detection of germline pathogenic mutations by NGS in the MMR genes (MLH1,
MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2), a total of 25 samples were Lynch syndrome positive. Table 27 and
Table 28 present concordance and agreement results, respectively, between the Idylla MSI Test
and germline NGS of MMR genes for all samples. Of the total 25 confirmed Lynch cases by
germline NGS, the Idylla MSI Test correctly identified 23 samples as MSI-H. Two (2) samples
typed as MSS were confirmed by NGS to have pathogenic mutations in the MSH2 gene.
The PPA between Idylla MSI Test and NGS for identification of Lynch syndrome was 92%.
The NPA is less informative since Lynch syndrome negative samples by germline NGS can
still exhibit MSI-H due to sporadic somatic mutations in one or more of the MMR genes
(sporadic dMMR).

5. Calibration and Quality controls:
In contrast to standard PCR equipment, the ldylla System is calibrated at the time of
manufacturing. No user performed system calibration is needed. The instrument
automatically initiates a self-test before a cartridge is processed. This test checks
individual instrument modules. If the self-test fails, a fatal error is reported and the
instrument is disabled. On a monthly basis, the system requires a self-diagnostic test
to check for potential hardware issues. The system notifies the user of the test need
by displaying a warning icon on the console. Self-diagnostic test failure leads to a
fatal error and requires the intervention of authorized service personnel.
