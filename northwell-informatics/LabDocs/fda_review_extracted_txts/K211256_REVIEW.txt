See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The NEST Disposable Sampler (Viral Transport Medium) is intended for the collection and
transport of upper respiratory clinical specimens to the laboratory for standard diagnostic or
identification techniques. The Viral Transport Medium can be used in the laboratory to perform
culture, isolation and detection of upper respiratory viruses including Influenza A, Rhinovirus,
and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Viral Transport Media is composed of media tube filled with VTM (Viral Transport Media),
with or without swabs, depending on the kit configuration.
The Viral Transport Media is composed of Sodium chloride, Disodium hydrogen phosphate
dodecahydrate, Potassium chloride, Potassium dihydrogen phosphate, Magnesium sulfate
heptahydrate, glucose, HEPES, Sodium bicarbonate, Fluconazole, Gentamicin sulfate,
Griseofulvin, Polymyxin sulfate, Sodium hydroxide, Calcium chloride, BSA, L-cysteine, and
with or without Phenol red.
The preservation tube is made of medical-grade polypropylene materials. The pre filled VTM
tubes are provided as 5 mL tubes filled with 2.5 mL VTM or 10 mL tubes filled with 3 mL
VTM.
Both the 5mL and the 10mL size tubes filled with the volumes noted above are sold alone, kitted
with either an oropharyngeal (OP) swab, a nasopharyngeal (NP)swabs or kitted with both OP
and NP swabs. The OP and NP swabs are flocked nylon fiber with the swab shaft made of ABS
(acrylonitrile butandiene styrene).
B Principle of Operation:
The Viral Transport Media consists of a universal transport medium that can sustain the viability
of clinically important viruses. The media is intended to be used by trained health care
professionals. The VTM contains proteins for stabilization, antibiotics to minimize bacterial and
fungal growth, a buffer to maintain a neutral pH and a pH indicator (phenol red) which is
optional.

Shelf-life: The shelf-life of the Viral Transport Media was determined in real-time to be 12
months when stored at 2-8oC and 25 ± 3oC. To assess the integrity of the kit, the following
properties of the kit were assessed, at 5 replicates per timepoint, and had the following
results. Three lots were assessed for the following categories:
a. The media was assessed for appearance. The Viral Transport Media remained a clear
red color when assessed at 2-8oC and 25 ± 3oC at various time intervals out to 12
months.
b. pH was assessed using a pH meter to demonstrate that the Viral Transport Media
maintain a pH between 7.3-7.5 when assessed at 2-8oC and 25 ± 3oC for 12 months.
c. Sterility was assessed by plating 100 µL of Viral Transport Media stored at 2-8oC and
25 ± 3oC at various time intervals out to 12 months, on PCA plates. The media
showed no microbial growth at any of the time points tested.
d. The integrity of the antimicrobial components in the medium was assessed via a
bacterial growth inhibition (bacteriostasis) study. The study demonstrated that media
was bacteriostatic when the media was stored at 2-8oC and 25 ± 3oC for 12 months.
The following organisms E. coli, S. aureus, B. subtilis, C ablicans and A. niger, were
assessed and culture growth was determined to be inhibited through its claimed shelf
life.
Sterilization:
The Viral Transport Media tube with media are not sold as sterile nor are they intended to be
sterilized by the user. These vials are single use devices that do not require cleaning by the
operator.
Swabs are sterilized in the final packaging using Irradiation Sterilization. Irradiation
sterilization was performed using ISO 11137-1: 2015 and ISO 11137-2: 2016. A bioburden
study was conducted, and it was determined that a 14.8 kGy dose of electron beam
irradiation was required to reach a sterility assurance level of 10-6.
6. Detection Limit:
Viral Recovery:
Culture-Based Viral Recovery Studies: Performance of the Viral Transport Media was
evaluated for virus viability at different incubation times, temperatures, and 3 lots of media.
Viability Assay Layout. Strains of Respiratory syncytial virus Type A (RSV-A), Influenza A
(A/PR/8/34 H1N1) virus, and Rhinovirus Type 16 (HRV-16) were used for media validation.
Each virus was first mixed with nasopharyngeal matrix, transferred with the collection swab and
then added to the Viral Transport Media to yield a final concentration of 105 TCID /mL. The
50
mixtures were then incubated at 4°C and 25°C in triplicates. Aliquots of each replicate were
recovered at 0, 24, or 48 hours and serially diluted. A 100 µL volume of each dilution was then
inoculated in duplicate into the susceptible host cell line. Host cells (HEp-2 for RSV-A, MDCK
for H1N1, and HeLa for HRV-16) were plated at a suitable density in microwell plates for 2-3
days prior to evaluation. The following controls were run: a viability control containing no virus
to ensure mammalian cell integrity and absence of contamination; a virus control containing virus
stock to ensure infectivity of virus; a cytotoxicity control containing VTM only to observe any
cytotoxic effects from the VTM on the mammalian cells; and a recovery control containing virus
in culture medium stored and tested under the same conditions as the test samples. Host cells and
K211256 - Page 5 of 8

--- Page 6 ---
diluted virus were incubated for 2-3 days, followed by fixation of the cells with Formalin for 1
hour and finally staining with methylene blue for 15 minutes. Viability was determined by
assessing for plaque formation in triplicate for each time point tested. Tables 1, 2, and 3 show
the mean PFU/mL values for each virus tested at time 0 and different times and temperatures for
viral recovery. The data supported the claim for storage times of 24 hours and 48 hours and
temperatures of 4°C and 25°C.
