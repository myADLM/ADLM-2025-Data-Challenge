Same as Intended Use
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use with the cobas e 801.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys Syphilis immunoassay is a fully automated, qualitative assay that uses a double
antigen sandwich format for the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to T. pallidum (TP).
Recombinant T. pallidum antigens labeled with either biotin or a ruthenium complex bind to
T. pallidum-specific IgG or IgM to form a double antigen sandwich complex. The sandwich
complex binds to streptavidin-coated microparticles which can be immobilized magnetically
to the surface of an electrode. Unbound substances are removed during a wash step using
ProCell. A chemiluminescent substrate is then added to the reaction tube. Application of a
voltage to the electrode induces a chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a
photomultiplier.
The presence or absence of anti-TP antibodies in the specimen is determined by comparing
the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction to the cutoff index (COI) determined from an
active calibration. The strength of the signal generated is proportional to the amount of bound
enzyme and thus the amount of anti-T. pallidum antibodies present in the specimen. If the
chemiluminescent signal in the reaction is greater than or equal to the cutoff signal, the
specimen is considered reactive for anti-TP antibodies. If the chemiluminescent signal is
below the cutoff signal, the specimen is considered nonreactive for the anti-TP antibodies.
The results are reported out as follows:
COI ≥ 1.00 Reactive
COI < 1.00 Nonreactive
K211302 - Page 2 of 7

--- Page 3 ---
Interpretation of results:
Reactive Reactive for treponemal antibodies
Nonreactive Nonreactive for treponemal antibodies
Test results are intended to aid in diagnosis only. As with all serological tests for syphilis,
results should always be interpreted in conjunction with additional treponemal or non-
treponemal serologic test results (as appropriate), the patient’s clinical symptoms, medical
history, and other clinical and/or laboratory findings to produce a diagnosis of syphilis by
disease stage.
All initially reactive samples should be retested in duplicate with the Elecsys Syphilis assay.
If cutoff index values < 1.00 are found in both cases, the samples are considered negative for
anti-Treponema pallidum antibodies.
Initially reactive samples with cutoff index values of ≥ 1.00 in either of the retests are
considered repeatedly reactive. Repeatedly reactive samples must be confirmed according to
recommended confirmatory algorithms.
The PreciControl Syphilis 1 and 2 controls and Syphilis Cal1 and Cal2 calibrators are for use
with the Elecsys Syphilis Assay.

This is a fully automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
A limited number of studies were conducted to verify the assay performance cleared under
K160910 was not affected by the changes made to improve tolerance to elevated levels of biotin.
1. Internal Precision:
The precision of the Elecsys Syphilis assay was evaluated in an internal study using seven
human serum samples, the PreciControl 1 and PreciControl 2 controls, and one lot of reagent.
Two replicates of each serum sample and control were tested two times per day for 21 days.
Human serum samples were prepared to create a panel of two negative samples (COI < 1.0),
one low positive samples (COI approximately = 1.0), and four positive samples (COI > 1.0).
The mean COI value, Repeatability Standard Deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of
variation (%CV) as well as Intermediate Precision SD and %CV were calculated for each
group of samples. A summary of the results is shown below.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable; this is a qualitative assay.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Potential interference with specimens containing biotin was evaluated by testing three anti-T.
pallidum antibody concentrations (negative, near cut-off and positive). One aliquot of each
serum sample was spiked with the interfering substance (biotin), another aliquot was spiked
with the same volume of the respective solvent (dilution pool). The interfering pool was then
incrementally diluted into the dilution pool. The recovery for each sample was calculated by
comparison to the analyte concentration of the respective dilution pools.
