A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA employs immunofluorescence for the rapid qualitative detection of a
Campylobacter-specific antigen in human fecal specimens. Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA is
designed to detect C. jejuni, C. coli, C. lari and C. upsaliensis from patients with signs and
symptoms of gastroenteritis. The test is intended for use with preserved fecal specimens in
transport media and unpreserved fecal specimens. Test results should be considered in
conjunction with clinical findings and patient history.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
• Rx - For Prescription Use Only
• The Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA was evaluated using only fresh fecal samples and fecal
samples stored in Cary Blair media or C&S media. The performance of fecal samples stored
in other transport media (e.g., formalin, polyvinyl alcohol) has not been evaluated and
therefore, should not be used.
• No data exists on the effects of colonic washes, barium enemas, laxatives, or bowel
preparations on the performance of the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA. All of these procedures
can result in extensive dilution or the presence of additives that may affect test performance.
• The fluorescence signal obtained with this assay is invisible to the unaided eye. The test
results can only be obtained with the proper use of Sofia 2
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA can only be run on the Sofia 2 Instrument.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA is an immunofluorescence-based, lateral flow assay that uses an
antibody sandwich design to detect Campylobacter-specific antigens in stool specimens from
individuals with signs and symptoms of gastroenteritis.
The patient stool sample is placed in the Specimen Tube, containing Specimen Diluent, to make the
antigenic components more accessible to the test antibodies. An aliquot of the diluted sample is
dispensed through a filter into the Test Cassette sample well. From the sample well, the sample
migrates through a test strip containing various unique chemical environments. If Campylobacter
jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter lari, or Campylobacter upsaliensis specific antigens are
present, they will be bound by polyclonal antibodies coupled to fluorescent microparticles that
migrate through the test strip. The fluorescent microparticles containing bound antigens will be
captured by monoclonal antibodies at a defined location on the test strip where they are detected by
Sofia 2. If Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter lari, or Campylobacter
upsaliensis specific antigens are not present, the fluorescent microparticles will not be trapped by the
capture antibodies nor detected by Sofia 2.
The Test Cassette is placed inside of Sofia 2 for automatically timed development (“Walk Away”
mode), or pre-incubated on the bench top prior to loading into Sofia 2 (“Read Now” mode), where
Sofia 2 will scan, measure, and interpret the immunofluorescent signal using method-specific
algorithms. Note that a supervisor can place Sofia 2 into Locked Walk Away mode, which only
K211342 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
allows testing to be performed in Walk Away mode. Once testing is complete, Sofia 2 will display
the test results (Positive, Negative, or Invalid) on the screen.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
As noted above, the test can be used in “Walk Away” mode, or “Read Now” mode. The primary
difference between these modes is that in “Read Now” mode, the operator is responsible for the
incubation time; in the “Walk Away” mode, the instrument will wait to read the strip until the
specified development time has passed. In this submission, all analytical studies were conducted in
“Read Now” mode. A validation study was conducted to demonstrate that the analytic study results
using the “Read Now” mode can be considered representative. See section VII.A.3.“Read Now” vs.
“Walk Away” Mode Study for more information and the results of this study.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA was determined using a 3-member masked fecal
sample panel that consisted of a negative, low positive (1-2x higher than C ) and a moderate
95
positive (2-3x higher than C ). Each fecal sample was spiked with C. jejuni (strain CCUG
95
11284) whole organism to achieve the desired level. The samples were tested once per day over a
20-day period by multiple operators using three reagent lots. A total of 240 tests per panel
member (1 run per day x 4 replicates per run x 20-days x 3 lots) were performed. Positive and
negative controls were run with each sample panel of masked samples. All replicates for the
negative panel member were negative and all replicates for the positive panel members were
positive.
The reproducibility of the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA was determined using an 8-member
masked fecal sample panel. The panel consisted of 2 negatives, 2 high negatives (just below C ),
5
2 low positives (1-2x higher than C ) and 2 moderate positives (2-3x higher than C ). Each
95 95
fecal sample was spiked with C. jejuni (strain CCUG 11284) whole organism to achieve the
desired level. Testing was performed at three laboratories, one of which was on-site. The samples
were tested by 2 operators per day over 5 non-consecutive days with 2 reagent lots for a total of

90 replicates per panel member (1 run per day x 3 replicates per run x 5-days x 3 sites x 2 lots).
In total, 180 measurements were performed for each evaluated Campylobacter concentration
(e.g. 2 low positive panel members x 90 replicates per panel member = 180 measurements), for a
total of 360 expected positive and 360 expected negative measurements. Positive and negative
controls were run with each sample panel of masked specimens. The results were consistent
among the three locations with 100% reproducibility for all test panel members.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-Reactivity and Microbial Interference
The Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA was evaluated for cross-reactivity with the bacteria, fungi and
viruses listed in Table 1. For cross-reactivity testing, bacteria and fungi were spiked at
concentrations >107 CFU/mL and viruses were spiked at concentrations >105 TCID /mL, unless
50
otherwise noted. For cross-reactivity testing, samples were prepared in the absence of C. jejuni.
For microbial interference testing, samples were evaluated in the presence of C. jejuni (strain
CCUG 11284), which was spiked at 2-3x LoD with whole organism. Due to safety concerns with
culturing Listeria monocytogenes, freeze-dried biomaterial from ATCC was reconstituted in 1
mL of sterile PBS and tested alone (negative sample) or spiked with C. jejuni (strain CCUG
11284) whole organism at 2-3x LoD (positive sample). Four (4) clinically positive Norovirus
fecal specimens (determined by RT-PCR) were obtained from a clinical repository (Wyoming
Public Health Laboratory). The two specimens that were genogroup I (GGI) were pooled, and the
two specimens that were genogroup II (GGII) were pooled. The pooled samples served as
negative Campylobacter samples while the pooled specimens spiked with Campylobacter jejuni
(strain CCUG 11284) whole organism at 2-3x LoD served as the positive samples.
C. helveticus (strain ATCC 51209) was cross-reactive at 6.3x106 CFU/mL, which is ~3x the LoD
of C. lari in unpreserved fecal matrix. Additional C. helveticus concentrations were tested and
cross-reactivity was no longer observed at 1.98x105 CFU/mL. No other tested microorganism
exhibited cross-reactivity with the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA.

Prozone Study
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a high concentration of Campylobacter
(antigen) does not interfere with a positive reaction in the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA. High
positive samples were prepared by spiking a negative fecal pool with 5.0x107 CFU/mL whole
organisms of C. jejuni (strain CCUG 11284), 2.4x108 CFU/mL whole organisms of C. coli (strain
CCUG 11283), 1.6x108 CFU/mL whole organisms of C. lari (strain 2015/1582), and 1.3x108
whole organisms of C. upsaliensis (strain 2018/0319H). A total of 5 different dilutions for each
Campylobacter species were prepared and tested. Testing was performed in triplicate according
to the Package Insert instructions. The results demonstrated that there was no overall hook affect,
and that elevated levels of whole organism did not affect the detection of Campylobacter.
“Read Now” vs. “Walk Away” Mode Study
To demonstrate that performance of the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA is not influenced by
operating the device in “Read Now” mode under the conditions used for analytical studies, a
comparison study was conducted with positive samples prepared by spiking a negative fecal pool
with C. jejuni (strain CCUG 11284) at 3x LoD. Negative samples were also included. Each
sample was tested in replicates of twenty using five Sofia 2 analyzers. Testing was completed
once with Sofia 2 analyzers in “Read Now” mode and once with Sofia 2 analyzers in “Walk
Away” mode.
There was 100% agreement between the expected and observed results for all positive and
negative samples. These results demonstrate that there is no notable difference in performance
between “Read Now” and “Walk Away” modes in the analytical testing setting. These study
results are acceptable and support performing analytical testing solely in “Read Now” mode.

3x LoD), 5 C. jejuni high positive fecal samples (4-5x LoD) and 2 negative samples. C. jejuni
strain CCUG 11284 was used to generate the positive samples.
Unpreserved and preserved stool samples were stored at room temperature (15-30°C) and
refrigerated (2-8°C) and tested at 24 hour intervals for 120 hours. Positive and negative controls
were also tested. The following transport media were used for the study: ThermoFisher Protocol
Cary Blair media and ThermoFisher Protocol C&S. Positive samples remained positive and
negative samples remained negative throughout the study. Storage in transport media did not
affect the stability of the samples. Based on these results, the recommended storage time for
unpreserved and preserved (Cary Blair and C&S) stool samples is up to 96 hours at room
temperature (15-30°C) and refrigerated (2-8°C).
Unpreserved stool was also stored frozen (i.e., -10°C) and tested at 0, 5, 10, and 14 days. Positive
samples at all concentrations remained positive and negative samples remained negative
throughout the study. Based on these results, the recommended storage time for unpreserved
stool samples is up to 13 days frozen at <-10°C.
Freeze/Thaw Stability
Freeze/Thaw stability for unpreserved specimens was evaluated for five freeze/thaw cycles over
a 7-day period. C. jejuni, C. coli, C. lari, and C. upsaliensis were each tested by spiking whole
organisms into unpreserved stool at the following concentrations: high negative (~0.5x LoD),
low positive (1-2x LoD), and high positive (3-5x LoD). For C. jejuni, 4 high negatives, 15 low
positives, and 4 high positive samples were prepared and tested. For each of the remaining
Campylobacter species, 2 high negatives, 5 low positives, and 2 high positives were tested. All
samples were tested in duplicate. For this study, samples were stored at -10°C.
At baseline, 5 of 15 C. jejuni low positive samples yielded one negative replicate and one
positive replicate. Repeat testing was performed on 4 of these samples in duplicate, and 3
samples yielded two positive results, while one sample yielded 2 negative results. All subsequent
timepoints were positive for the C. jejuni low positive sample, thus the baseline false negative
results were considered acceptable. No other sample converted from positive-to-negative or
negative-to-positive after any of the freeze/thaw cycles. The data support a claim for four
freeze/thaw cycles and demonstrates that freezing neither enhances nor impairs the performance
of the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Detection Study
The limit of detection (LoD) of the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA was determined by spiking whole
organism culture preparations of Campylobacter jejuni (strain CCUG 11284), Campylobacter
coli (strain CCUG 11283), Campylobacter lari (strain 2015/1582), and Campylobacter
upsaliensis (strain 2018/0319H) into negative fecal matrix and Cary Blair and C&S transport
media. The LoD is defined as the concentration of Campylobacter (in CFU/mL) that yields a
positive result 95% of the time and negative result 5% of the time. The LoD was determined for
two Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA cassette lots. For each lot, multiple dilutions of C. jejuni, C. coli,
C. lari, and C. upsaliensis were tested in replicates of 20. The LoD values in Table 3 represent
the cassette lot yielding the highest (i.e., least sensitive) LoD. The LoDs were similar between
lots.

The reactivity (inclusivity) study was conducted using C. jejuni and C. coli strains from the
Culture Collection University of Gothenburg (CCUG). The reactivity of C. upsaliensis and C.
lari were evaluated using clinical isolates obtained from patients with symptoms of
gastroenteritis that were isolated at the Centre National de Reference des Campylobacters et
Helicobacters – Universite de Bordeaux between 2015 and 2018. The strains are listed in Table
4. For reactivity testing, each strain was spiked into negative fecal matrix at 2-3x the LoD of the
corresponding reference strain used to confirm the LoD, and then tested with the Sofia 2
Campylobacter FIA. All results were positive.

1 CCUG 24567 is a C. jejuni subspecies doylei isolate.
Additional inclusivity testing was performed for select strains of C. coli, C. lari, and C.
upsaliensis to verify the lowest concentration of each strain that is reactive in the Sofia 2
Campylobacter FIA. Four-fold serial dilutions for each of the targeted strains were prepared
from stock culture slurries using negative fecal matrix and tested in replicates of three in the
assay. The qualitative results were used to determine the lowest detectable level in the series,
where 3/3 results were positive (Table 5). The results demonstrated that these strains produced
positive results in the assay at concentrations below the limit of detection established with the
corresponding reference strains. Note: the purpose of this study was not to set a true limit of
detection, but the results are used to demonstrate inclusivity of these strains at the specified
concentrations detected (bolded in Table 5).

1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Prospective Study
The performance of the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA was assessed with specimens prospectively
collected from patients with signs and symptoms of gastroenteritis. Specimens were collected
from two independent clinical sites. The sensitivity and specificity of the Sofia 2 Campylobacter
FIA was calculated by comparing directly to culture results performed at both sites. Prospective
testing consisted of 811 stool specimens tested in clinical microbiology laboratories at the
Medical College of Wisconsin and TriCore Reference Laboratories. Both “Read Now” and
“Walk Away” modes were used for specimen testing.
The ages of patients ranged from 2 years to 93 years with 3% of the specimens coming from
patients that were ≤ 18 years. Of the 811 patients tested, 61.9% were female and 38.1% were
male. No difference in test performance was observed based on patient age or gender.
A summary of the clinical performance of the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA for both sites,
combined is shown in Table 6.
The results of the study show that the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA exhibited a sensitivity of 100%
and a specificity of 99.3% compared to culture. The lower bound of the two-sided 95%
confidence interval for the sensitivity point estimate was slightly lower than expectations for this
type of assay. However, the sensitivity results were deemed acceptable without the need to
conduct additional clinical specimen testing for the following reasons: (1) Challenges with
performing prospective clinical studies during the COVID-19 pandemic and, (2) The prospective
study was supplemented with archived positive specimens (see section VII.C.Archived Study,
below).
All samples with discrepant results were tested at a third site using an in-house species-specific
RT-PCR method and bidirectional sequencing. Of the 6 false positive results, all were confirmed
to be positive using these additional tests.

*All specimens that were culture negative and Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA positive were
confirmed to be Campylobacter positive by a species-specific RT-PCR method and bidirectional sequencing.
Archived Study
Additional testing was performed at the third clinical site on 70 retrospectively collected
specimens with culture results. The study included 35 positive and 35 negative specimens by
Campylobacter spp. culture. The patient ages ranged from 2 years to 87 years. All positive
specimens were further characterized as Campylobacter spp. positive by a validated in-house RT-
PCR (targeting species-specific genes) and by bidirectional sequencing (targeting sequences of
the 16S rRNA gene of Campylobacter spp. and species-specific genes for identification). These

specimens were then tested by the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA. With this information, FDA was
able to assess if “weak positives” were included in the archived study and determine performance
of the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA with such specimens. All 35 specimens tested positive for
Campylobacter spp. by all methods, yielding 100% correlation with all test methods.
Rare Isolate Contrived Study
The performance of the Sofia 2 Campylobacter FIA was further evaluated by testing a panel
consisting of five C. coli, five C. upsaliensis, and five C. lari isolates. The C. coli strains were
obtained from the Culture Collection University of Gothenburg. The C. upsaliensis and C. lari
strains are clinical isolates obtained from the Centre National de Reference des Campylobacters
et Helicobacters – Universite de Bordeaux. All samples were prepared by spiking negative,
pooled fecal matrix with whole organism at 2x the LoD of the reference strain, which was used to
confirm the LoD. Both unpreserved stool and preserved stool (Cary Blair and C&S transport
media) were evaluated during the study. Due to availability of a limited number of isolates, each
isolate and matrix type were tested in triplicate, twice a day over a period of three days for a total
of 18 data points. Ninety datapoints per Campylobacter species and matrix were performed (18
data points/isolate x 5 isolates per species = 90 data points). The results of this study
demonstrated 100% positive percent agreement (PPA) with expected results for all C. coli and C.
upsaliensis isolates, regardless of matrix. For C. lari, 100% PPA with expected results was
obtained for all isolates in unpreserved stool and C&S transport media. For C. lari in Cary Blair
media, 98.9% PPA was obtained due to a single negative result. Upon retesting the sample that
yielded a negative result, a positive result was obtained. These results are acceptable.
