B Indication(s) for Use:
The EasyStat 300 is designed for clinical laboratory use, making quantitative measurements of
pO2 (partial pressure of oxygen), pCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), and pH (hydrogen
ion activity) in whole blood (arterial/venous) samples from Li-Heparinized Syringes or Capillary
Tubes. This Analyzer should only be used by trained technicians in clinical laboratories to aid in
the diagnosis and treatment of patients with blood gas and/or acid-base disturbances.
Blood gases (pO2, pCO2) and pH measurements in blood are used in the diagnosis and treatment
of life-threatening acid-base disturbances.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
EasyStat 300 Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The candidate device is comprised of the EasyStat 300 Analyzer, the EasyStat reagent pack,
reference electrode, pO2sensor, ion selective electrode cartridges (for pH and pCO2), barcode
scanner, and calibrators. The system is designed for use by trained medical professionals in the
clinical laboratory and is for prescription use only.
The EasyStat 300 consists of a reagent module containing calibrating solutions A2, B2, and C2.
The analyzer runs in two modes: the syringe mode (175µL of lithium heparinized venous whole
blood and arterial blood) and the capillary mode (100µL of lithium heparinized venous whole
blood and arterial blood) to analyze patient samples. To operate the analyzer in the capillary
mode, a separate capillary tube kit is required. Medica’s EasyQC materials are required to be run
every day to validate the performance of the analyzer.
B Principle of Operation:
pH: pH is measured using a potentiometric method based on the use of an ion-selective
electrode. One side of the membrane is in contact with a solution of constant pH. The other side
is in contact with a solution of unknown pH. A change in potential develops which is
proportional to the pH difference of these solutions. This change in potential is measured against
a reference electrode of constant potential. The magnitude of the potential difference is a
measure of the pH of the unknown sample.
pCO2: pCO2 is measured using a potentiometric method based modified pH sensor. Carbon
dioxide in the sample makes contact with a polymeric membrane mounted on a combination
measuring/ reference electrode. CO diffuses across the membrane into a thin layer of electrolyte
2
solution in response to partial pressure difference. This solution then becomes equilibrated with
the external gas pressure. CO in the solution becomes hydrated, which results in a change in
2
hydrogen ion activity, according to the equation:
CO + H O <=> H+ + [HCO –]
2 2 3
K211559 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
The change in hydrogen ion activity in the electrolyte solution produces a potential which is
measured against the internal filling solution. This change in potential is measured against the
constant potential of the reference electrode half cell and is logarithmically related to the pCO2
of the unknown sample.
pO2: pO2 is measured amperometrically by the generation of a current at the sensor surface. As
oxygen diffuses through a gas permeable membrane, the oxygen molecules are reduced at the
cathode, consuming four electrons for every molecule of oxygen reduced. This flow of electrons
is then measured by the sensor and is directly proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen in
the sample.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
EasyStat 300
2. Specimen Identification:
The specimen identification may be manually entered or automatically scanned by the
device.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The EasyStat 300 accepts lithium heparinized venous whole blood and arterial blood from
syringes or capillary tubes.
The sample type is selected using the device touchscreen. Samples may be introduced via a
collection glass/plastic syringe or a capillary tube. After the sample type (i.e. whole blood
arterial/venous samples) is selected and loaded, the probe is placed in the sample, which will
aspirate the appropriate sample volume (i.e. syringe mode - 175 μL, capillary mode - 100
μL). Once the sample is loaded, the analyzer moves the sample to the sensor module for
analysis.
4. Calibration:
The EasyStat 300 undergoes pump calibration, air calibration, and 2-point calibration. Once
the first calibration is completed, the analyzer will continue to perform calibrations
automatically on a fixed schedule. The time between calibrations is determined based on the
age (in hours) since the sensors/cartridges were first installed.
5. Quality Control:
The EasyStat 300 requires the use of three levels of Medica’s EasyQC materials for use on
the analyzer. Results that exceed the entered ranges are flagged for identification. Quality
control recommendations are provided in the labeling. It is recommended that each
laboratory follow their local, state, and federal regulations as it applies to quality control
materials.
6. Reagents:
The EasyStat 300 utilizes a reagent module which contains all the reagents, concentration of
calibration reagents, current reagent module serial number and installation date, and reagent
volume % remaining with the number of days remaining before calibrators expire.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two precision studies (i.e. Within-Run and Run-to-Run) were performed following the
recommendations in CLSI EP05-A3.
Within Run Precision Evaluation:
Within run precision testing was performed using lithium heparinized venous whole blood in
both the “Syringe” and the “Capillary” modes. Testing was performed on three EasyStat 300
analyzers over five days. Venous whole blood samples were collected in the following
manner: the first set of samples was analyzed immediately after collection, and the other two
were tonometered with a gas mixture to change the levels of pH, pCO2, and pO2. Five
venous whole blood samples were tested in five replicates at each concentration level in the
syringe mode, and then subsequently in the capillary mode. The results from one
representative analyzer for both modes are summarized below.

2. Linearity:
To support the measuring range, pH and pO2 were tested for linearity at 11 levels, and pCO2
was tested at nine levels. The samples were venous whole blood from healthy subjects that
were adjusted to different levels by addition of HCL or NaOH for pH samples, and
tonometrization for pO2 and pCO2 samples. Samples at the different levels were tested in
triplicate on the EasyStat 300 analyzers. For pH, pO2 and pCO2, regression analysis
demonstrated first order linearity.
The linear regression results are given in the table below:
Analyte Tested Range Claimed Measuring Range Slope Intercept r
pH
6.75-7.99 6.80 - 8.00 pH units 1.01 -0.07 0.99
pCO2
5.0-184.6 5.0 - 150.0 mmHg 1.08 -2.42 0.99
pO2
5.0 – 718 5.0 -700.0 mmHg 1.01 1.19 0.99
Based on these results, the linearity data support the claimed measuring interval for pH,
pCO2, and pO2.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
An interference testing study for endogenous and exogenous substances was performed on
lithium heparin venous whole blood samples in accordance with CLSI EP37-Edition 1. With
these samples, an interference screening test was conducted at 2 levels of pH (7.19 pH units
and 7.48 pH units), pCO2 (37 mmHg and 90 mmHg), and pO2 (23 mmHg and 143 mmHg),
tested in triplicate, on three EasyStat 300 analyzers. Interference was calculated as the bias
between the average test result with interfering substance and average control measurement
on one EasyStat 300 analyzer.

6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ) were
evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.
For pCO2 and pO2, the LoB and LoD of the EasyStat300 analyzer were evaluated using
tonometered lithium heparin venous whole blood samples. LoQ was defined as the lowest
concentration at which measured total error was less than the pre-defined total allowable
error of ± 5 mmHg.
For pH, a saline aqueous solution buffered at low pH were used to estimate LoB, LoD, and
LoQ. Linearity studies were used to support the lower end of the measuring range for pH (see
section VII.A.2. above).
The results are summarized in the table below:
