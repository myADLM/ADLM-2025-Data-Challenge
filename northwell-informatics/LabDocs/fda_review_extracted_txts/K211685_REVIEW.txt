Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of testosterone in human serum and
plasma.
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on the cobas e 601
immunoassay analyzer.
Measurements of testosterone are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving the
male sex hormones (androgens), including primary and secondary hypogonadism, delayed or
precocious puberty, impotence in males and, in females hirsutism (excessive hair) and
virilization (masculinization) due to tumors, polycystic ovaries, and adrenogenital syndromes.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys Testosterone II reagent kit consists of a Reagent Pack (R1, R2, and M (Streptavidin-
coated microparticles). The Ready-to-use Rack Pack (kit placed on the analyzer) contains:
· M Streptavidin-coated microparticles (transparent cap), 1 bottle, 6.5 mL: Streptavidin-coated
microparticles 0.72 mg/mL; preservative.

2. Linearity:
For linearity, one reagent lot was tested on one cobas e 601 with one run. One human serum
sample with high analyte content above the measuring range was diluted to the lower end of
the measuring range with various amounts of human serum sample without analyte content.
A similar design was used for each plasma dilution series. The dilution series contained 25
steps for serum and 20 dilution steps for lithium heparin plasma. Samples were assayed in 3-
fold determinations (3 sera and 3 plasma samples for one lot). Each dilution series contained
samples from approximately 2.0 ng/dL to 1550 ng/dL and covered the claimed measuring
range. One representative serum and one representative plasma dilution series are shown

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous Interference
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous interfering substances
was determined for testosterone concentrations and a dilution set of the added interfering
substances. One reagent lot was tested on 3 samples of each interfering substance. One
aliquot of each testosterone sample was spiked with the interfering endogenous substance
and used as “interference pool”. Another aliquot of the sample was spiked with the same
volume of the solvent of the interfering endogenous substance (without interfering substance)
and used as the related “dilution pool”. A series of 11 dilution steps were prepared by mixing
the interference pools and the related dilution pools in 10 % increments. The recovery
(absolute deviation or % recovery) was calculated for each sample compared to the expected
value.
Definitions of interference were as follows:
Non- significant interference was defined as recovery of ±10% (for concentration range of
>100 ng/dL), ±15% (for concentration range of >50 to 100 ng/dL), and ±7.5 ng/dL (for
concentration range of 15 to 50 ng/dL).
The sponsor claims no significant interference at the following concentrations:
Interferent Highest Concentration tested
without interference
Hemoglobin 600 mg/dL
Intralipid 800 mg/dL
Bilirubin 30 mg/dL
Rheumatoid factor 1000 IU/mL
Biotin
One aliquot of each testosterone sample was spiked with biotin up to 3600 ng/mL and used
as “interference pool”. Another aliquot of the sample was spiked with the same volume of the
solvent of the interfering endogenous substance (without interfering substance) and used as
the related “dilution pool”. A series of 11 dilution steps were prepared by mixing the
interference pools and the related dilution pools in 10 % increments. The recovery (absolute
deviation or % recovery) was calculated for each sample compared to the expected value.
The acceptance criteria were the same as described above. The data supports the labeling
claim of no significant interference observed with biotin up to 1200 ng/mL with this device.
Common Drug Interferences
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of drugs was determined by comparing
values obtained from samples spiked with 17 common pharmaceutical compounds with the
reference sample (unspiked). All samples used were native human serum pools. Samples

“A strong interaction with Nandrolone (INN international nonproprietary name, WHO) was
found. Do not use samples from patients under Nandrolone treatment. Testosterone
undecanoate (INN international nonproprietary name, WHO) is metabolized to testosterone
after administration. The Elecsys Testosterone II assay does not differentiate between
endogenous testosterone and exogenous testosterone resulting from metabolized testosterone
under testosterone supplementation therapy.”

Analytical Specificity/Cross-Reactivity
The analytical specificity of the Elecsys Testosterone II assay was determined with one
reagent lot on one cobas e 601 analyzer using a human serum matrix with one testosterone
level 5 ng/dL). The sample aliquots were spiked with potential cross-reactants and measured
in the presence or absence of the potential cross-reactants and cross reactivity was calculated
using the following equation:
%Cross-reactivity = ((mean analyte conc.of spiked sample −mean analyte conc.of unspiked
sample)/ spiked concentration of cross−reactant) x 100%

6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB)
For determination of LoB five analyte free samples were measured in two-fold
determinations in 6 runs, distributed over 3 days, with 2 different lots on one cobas e 601
analyzer. In total 60 measured values of analyte free samples were obtained per lot.
The LoB claim in the labeling is 1.5 ng/dL.
Limit of Detection (LoD)
For determination of LoD five samples with low-analyte concentration (from LoB up to
approx. 4 times the LoB, including 2 native single samples and 3 diluted single samples)
were measured in 2-fold determination in 6 runs, distributed over ≥ 3 days, with 2 different
lots on one cobas e 601 analyzer. In total 60 measured values of samples with low analyte
concentrations were obtained per lot. Data analysis was based on determination of the 60
measured values of the 5 low analyte samples as follows: LoD = LoB + 1.653 x SD total (of
low analyte samples).
The LoD claim in the labeling is 2.5 ng/dL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
For the determination of LoQ, 2 lots were evaluated, each with 9 human serum (native single
samples) covering the range between 9.8-21.5 ng/dL. Each sample was measured in 2
replicates one run per day over 6 days on one cobas e 601 analyzer. Assay calibration was
performed as specified in the package insert. Analyte-low native samples or sample pools
were used for the determination of LoQ. The LoQ is set as the lowest concentration of
analyte that can be reproducibly measured with a total error of ≤ 20 %.
The LoQ claim in the labeling is 12.0 ng/dL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Serum samples were measured internally using both the current and updated reagent
formulations. A total of 168 samples, including 5 spiked samples, that span the measuring
range were tested with 1 run per sample.
The Passing-Bablok regression analysis performed yielded the following equation:

The 95% confidence intervals for the slope were 0.940-0.957 and the 95% confidence
intervals for the intercept were 0.023-1.44.
