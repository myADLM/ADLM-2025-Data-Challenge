The BioTeke Sterile Disposable Virus Sampling Kit is intended for collection and transport of
clinical specimens to the laboratory for standard diagnostic/identification techniques. The
BioTeke Sterile Disposable Virus Sampling Kit consists of a sterile swab and culture-based
media that can be used for respiratory viral diagnostic assays including, Influenza, Respiratory
Syncytial Virus (RSV) A and B, Parainfluenza, Adenovirus, and Rhinovirus.

NA
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
R - For Prescription Use Only
X
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BioTeke Sterile Disposable Virus Sampling Swab Kit is a specimen collection and transport
kit designed to collect a throat or nasal sample from the patient (utilizing the provided Specimen
Collection Swab) and subsequently transferring the swab containing the patient’s microbial
sample into the provide 10mL polymer tube containing 3mL of VTM (Virus Transport Media)
for purposes of transferring the swab and associated collected microorganisms into a transport
container designed to preserve the sample during transport to the laboratory prior to laboratory
analysis. The Specimen Collection Swab is designed with a break point (notched area on the
shaft) to allow for the top of the VTM tube to close when the inoculated Specimen Collection
Swab is placed into the BioTeke VTM tube. The BioTeke Sterile Disposable Virus Sampling
Swab Kit consists of the following:
• One (1) Specimen Collection Swab (sterile and individually packaged)
• One (1) Virus Transport Media (10mLpolymer tube containing 3mL of sterile VTM)
The Specimen Collection Swab measures 150mm with a breakpoint location (from the tip) at
80mm, a head length at 20mm and a head width of 3mm. The width of the shaft for the
Specimen Collection Swab measures 2.5mm. The 10mL polymer tubes are filled with 3mL of
Virus Transport Media (VTM) and secured with a leak-proof polymer cap.
B Principle of Operation:
The swab is used to collect nasal or throat samples.

The ability of BioTeke Sterile Disposable Virus Sampling Kit to maintain viability of
respiratory viruses was assessed by virus culture after storage at various conditions (time and
time). Viruses were diluted in matrix at approximately 3 X the Limit of Detection (LoD)
prior to transfer into the VTM. The results demonstrate that the viruses, influenza, RSV A,
RSV B, parainfluenza, adenovirus and rhinovirus stored at 23-25°C were maintained within
0.25 log (PFU/mL) of the input concentration of virus for 48 hours as described in the table
below.
