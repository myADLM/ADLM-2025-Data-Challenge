The Selux Gram-Positive Panel is a qualitative test for the following antimicrobial agents with
the specific target organisms identified below:
• Cefoxitin Screen to predict mecA-mediated oxacillin resistance: Staphylococcus aureus,
Staphylococcus lugdunensis
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The following limitations were added to the device labeling based on performance demonstrated
in the current submission:
• The ability of the Selux AST system to detect resistance in the following
antimicrobial/organism combinations is unknown because an insufficient number of resistant
isolates were available at the time of comparative testing.
• Ampicillin: Enterococcus faecalis
• Cefoxitin Screen: Staphylococcus lugdunensis
• Ceftaroline: Staphylococcus aureus
• Eravacycline: Enterococcus spp.
• Linezolid: Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp.
• Minocycline: Staphylococcus spp.
• Vancomycin: Staphylococcus spp.
• The current absence of daptomycin-resistant isolates precludes defining any results other
than “Susceptible”. Isolates yielding results other than “Susceptible” should be submitted to a
reference laboratory for further testing. A single non-susceptible strain of S. aureus provided
a potential very major error during the comparative testing.
• Perform an alternative method of testing prior to reporting results for the following
antibiotic/organism combination(s):
• Clindamycin: Staphylococcus epidermidis when the Selux MIC is 4 µg/mL due to the
occurrence of two major errors
• Delafloxacin: Staphylococcus haemolyticus when the Selux MIC is 0.25 μg/mL or 0.5
μg/mL due to the <90% CA caused by six minor errors
• Eravacycline: Enterococcus faecium
• Erythromycin: Enterococcus spp.
• Levofloxacin: Enterococcus faecium when the Selux MIC is 2 µg/mL due to two very
major errors

• Oxacillin: Staphylococcus spp., except S. aureus and S. lugdunensis; Staphylococcus
aureus when the Selux MIC is ≤0.12 µg/mL; Staphylococcus lugdunensis when the Selux
MIC is 8 µg/mL
• Penicillin: Enterococcus faecium when the Selux MIC is ≥32 µg/mL due to three major
errors; Staphylococcus aureus when the Selux MIC is ≥4 µg/mL
• Trimethoprim: Coagulase-Negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis, S. hominis, S.
intermedius group, S. lugdunensis, and S. schleiferi)
• Vancomycin: Enterococcus faecium when the Selux MIC is >64 µg/mL due to two major
errors
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Selux AST System, Software version 1, subversion 8.165
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Selux AST System is an antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) system that consists of a
Sample Prep Station, an Inoculator, an Analyzer, a computer workstation, and the reagents and
consumables required to perform AST testing. The system is operated via software that guides
users through the manual sample preparation process and operates the automated Inoculator and
Analyzer. The software includes an algorithm that enables the system to determine the
susceptibility of an organism to the variety of antimicrobials provided in the Selux AST panels.
The system is designed so that only Gram stain information is required to initiate testing to select
the gram-negative or gram-positive antimicrobial panel. While complete system testing can be
performed without species-level identification, this information is required for the system to
report susceptibility results. Species identification information can be either manually input to
the Selux system or automatically downloaded from the laboratory information system (LIS) at
any time, once the sample ID is entered into the LIS.
The Selux AST Systems provides the following consumables: AST panels, panel lids, tubes and
caps for sample prep, troughs for inoculator, McFarland Standards for densitometer performance
checks, inoculator pipette tips, inoculator waste bins, inoculator growth media, inoculator
cleaning solution, analyzer reagent packs, analyzer liquid waste disinfectant tablets, analyzer
absorbent waste pads, and an analyzer solid waste bag.
The Selux AST System is divided into three primary AST steps performed at three different
stations: workbench (for sample preparation), inoculator (for inoculation), and analyzer (for
antimicrobial susceptibility testing).
Workbench (sample preparation)
The Workbench’s graphical user interface (GUI) is accessed via a web application to guide
users through the concentrated inoculum solution preparation (using the densitometer), panel
selection, and carrier loading. The barcode scanner is used to register each carrier and panel,
as well as associate them with each sample. During sample preparation, panels on the carriers
are exposed to an ionizer to remove any latent ionic charge which may interfere with the
K211759 - Page 4 of 30

--- Page 5 ---
assay. The saline pump is used to dispense saline aliquots for concentrated inoculum
preparation and McFarland standards used for densitometer calibration.
Selux panels are 384-well polystyrene microplates that contain dehydrated antimicrobials and
are sealed with a desiccant in air-impermeable foil pouches to provide room-temperature
stability.
The Selux AST System provides two types of carriers: standard carriers which hold up to
four panels and can be used to test 1 – 4 samples at a time and multiplex carriers which are
used when two or more different quality control (QC) organisms are being tested.
Panel inoculator
The Selux panel is inoculated by the Selux benchtop inoculator, an automated liquid handler.
The inoculator dilutes and transfers the concentrated inoculum solution into each panel. The
user interacts with the system through a GUI that runs on the built-in, touch screen monitor.
The inoculator ensures proper inoculation for each panel by reading the panel barcodes prior
to initiating its filling sequence. Further, the inoculator creates sterile assay control wells as
well as special test wells by directly pipetting microorganisms from the concentrated
inoculum solution into specific resistance detection wells on each panel that require high
microorganism concentrations.
AST Analyzer
The analyzer fully automates antimicrobial susceptibility testing requiring no user
intervention after the inoculated carrier is loaded. The analyzer is divided into three levels:
upper floor, lower floor, and reagent/waste. The upper floor contains the carrier loading bays.
A robotic panel gripper picks panels and moves them between positions. A multi-channel
bulk solution dispenser adds reagents to specified wells on each panel. The panels are placed
into orbital shaking incubators and read by a multimode microplate reader to record
absorbance and fluorescence measurements. When ready, the panels are moved to the lower
floor by an elevator gantry. The lower floor also contains a robotic panel gripper. It contains
a fluid handling station that dispenses and aspirates reagents. It also contains orbital shaker
mixing stations, for use in the assay binding steps, and a plate reader with time-resolved
fluorescence detection capabilities. The reagent/waste level contains drawers users can open
to replace the liquid analyzer reagent pack consumables and to access waste.
The Selux AST System with the Gram-Positive Panel can determine the MIC of various
antimicrobials when tested against specific organisms (Table 1).

(-) Indicates that a corresponding MIC is not defined for that category.
B Principle of Operation:
The Selux AST test requires that the Gram type of the organism be known prior to testing as the
information is necessary to select the proper AST panel to use (i.e., gram-positive or gram-
negative). The organism identification (ID) is not needed for Selux AST processing to be
performed; however, the organism ID is necessary for a final result to be reported.
The Selux AST System performs antimicrobial susceptibility testing similar to the gold-standard
broth microdilution method. To get an accurate reading of microbial growth, the sufficient
growth assay monitors growth in dedicated AST panel wells that contain organisms and cation-
adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth but no antimicrobials or probes. Sufficient growth assay wells are
monitored by fluorescence to those wells which the standard metabolism-based viability assay
pair resazurin/methylene blue have been added and/or by optical absorbance. Two probe-based
assays, a viability assay and a surface area assay, commence across all wells in the panel after
the threshold in the sufficient growth well has been met. The viability and surface area assays
are performed in each AST panel well, providing two complementary datasets for each well.

These data are input to an MIC-determining algorithm that provides results when organism IDs
are available.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Selux AST System
2. Specimen (Organism/Colony) Identification:
An order request is sent from the Laboratory Identification System (LIS), and the accession
identifiers and other information related to the specimen are received and stored by the Site
Service into the Site Database. A medical technologist will prepare one or more samples and
insert them into the Selux carrier under the guidance of the Sample Preparation web
interface. For the inoculator, users use the Sample Prep GUI to select the sample(s) to test
and determine the appropriate Carrier to use. The user utilizes an included barcode scanner to
scan Carrier Barcodes, accession information from barcoded agar plates, or concentrated
inoculum tubes, depending on the laboratory workflow. The user then selects the appropriate
panel type and loads it into the appropriate sample number on the carrier. The inoculator
ensures proper inoculation for each panel by reading the panel barcodes prior to initiating its
filler sequence. If the Selux AST system is connected to a LIS, it will attempt to obtain the
organism identification if it was part of an LIS order during the user-entered sample
accession. If no matching order request is found or the system is not connected to an LIS, the
user can enter the organism identification in the results page any time after sample
preparation. If an accession enters the Selux AST System through the LIS, the Selux AST
System will check that accession against the one the user provided. The user will be alerted
during Results Review of any organism identification discrepancies that must be manually
resolved.
3. Specimen (Organism/Colony) Sampling and Handling:
Samples are prepared using the Selux Workbench. The user prepares a concentrated
inoculum solution and uses the Selux-provided densitometer to ensure the proper
microorganism turbidity has been achieved. After preparing the concentrated inoculum and
placing in the Inoculator, the remaining steps are carried out by automated Selux processes.
The user is required to move inoculated panels from the Inoculator to the Analyzer.
4. Calibration:
The Selux AST System is setup and installed exclusively by trained service personnel. No
changes or modifications are to be made to the System configuration after service personnel
have completed setup procedures unless those activities and procedures are performed by
Selux Service personnel.
In addition, the densitometer should be calibrated weekly by the users to verify accuracy
using Selux-provided McFarland standards.
K211759 - Page 7 of 30

--- Page 8 ---
5. Quality Control:
The Selux AST System software contains Quality Control (QC) Sets (A, B, C) so that when
selected, specific QC strains for testing are listed (Table 2). Concentrated inocula are
prepared by the user similar as for clinical samples. The QC report lists several descriptors,
including the expected QC range, actual MIC value and result status (pass/fail) for each
tested antimicrobial agent. Pass/fail status is determined by the whether the actual MIC result
falls within the expected QC range (pass) or outside of the expected QC range (fail).

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the Selux AST System with the Gram-Positive Panel was
conducted at 3 testing sites (2 external and 1 internal site). Panel members generally
consisted of species indicated for use with each respective antimicrobial. To accommodate
the numerous antimicrobial/organism combinations being tested concurrently, up to three
non-indicated species, within an indicated genus or family, were considered acceptable for
testing. Reproducibility was determined from the total number (and percent) of results that
fell within one dilution (+/- one doubling dilution) of the modal MIC result for quantitative
assays or the number of results that were in category agreement for qualitative assays divided
by the total number of results. Reproducibility was evaluated between sites (inter-site) and
within sites (intra-site). Both best-case (assumes that off-scale results are within one dilution
of the mode) and worst-case (assumes that off-scale results are more than one dilution of the
mode) performance was determined for each antimicrobial, as outlined in the AST Special
Controls Guidance.
In the initial study, inter-site reproducibility was evaluated at three sites by testing at least 25
isolates with on-scale MIC values for each antimicrobial, for a minimum of 75 results per
antimicrobial (25 isolates x 3 sites = 75 results/antimicrobial). In general, best-case inter-site
reproducibility was acceptable (≥95%) and a sufficient number of results obtained (≥75
results). However, antimicrobials with inter-site worst-case reproducibility of <89% or an
insufficient number of results generated (i.e., <75) in the initial study were further evaluated
in a supplemental study in which testing was performed with three instruments. Data from
both studies are collated and summarized in Table 3. Performance is summarized for each
antimicrobial tested with all organisms as well as indicated organisms only. Inter-site
reproducibility was determined to be acceptable.

Intra-site reproducibility was evaluated by testing a minimum of five isolates in triplicate on
three days at one internal site for each antimicrobial to generate a minimum of 45 results per
antimicrobial (5 isolates x 3 replicates x 3 days = 45 results/antimicrobial). In general, best-
case intra-site reproducibility was acceptable (≥95%) and a sufficient number of results
obtained (≥45 results). However, antimicrobials with worst-case reproducibility <89% or an
insufficient number of results generated (i.e., <45) in the initial study were further evaluated

(six of the nine failures occurred on successive days of testing). Data from samples tested on
days in which QC failed were excluded from the clinical analysis. Failures with this
organism could not be replicated during investigative testing which comprised of 48
individual runs, each with a separate McFarland inoculum preparation, as performance was
100% (48/48). Overall, QC was determined to be acceptable.

Inoculum Density Check: The Selux AST System has an onboard densitometer and liquid
handler that prepares and transfers a McFarland inoculum preparation into each panel. To
verify the microorganism turbidity, quantitative culture was performed to determine the
inoculum densities of all QC and reproducibility samples as well as a minimum of 10% of
the clinical and challenge isolates. The microorganism concentrations for samples tested with
the Selux AST System ranged from 5.0 x 104 to 4.5 x 106 CFU/mL and with the reference
method ranged from 3.5 x 104 to 1.2 x 106 CFU/mL which are equivalent to an 0.5
McFarland suspension (E. coli ATCC 25922 approximately 5 x 105 CFU/mL).
Device Failure: There were no device failures encountered during initial testing with the
Selux AST System. However, three device failures were observed in the supplemental and
additional independent validation studies. All were detected at the time of failure by the
system and resulted in faulted panels, thus had no impact on results. Two failures were due to
an issue with the controller board of an off-the-shelf Inoculator component, a dual
pressure/vacuum source, that was resolved by replacing the controller board. A software
update was released to correct the issue. The third failure was a damaged cable supplying
signal and power to a z-axis motor in the Selux Analyzer. No failures were observed in
subsequent processing after the cable was replaced.
Growth Failure Rate: There were no growth failures on the Selux AST System. All samples
that generated reference method results also generated Selux results.
Purity Check: Purity plates were prepared from the inoculum suspensions of every sample
tested. AST results were only reported for pure isolates; data generated from plates that
generated multiple colony morphologies was excluded from analyses.

9. Carry-Over/Cross-Contamination:
Cross-contamination with the Selux AST System was evaluated by testing first with the
Selux Inoculator and then with the entire Selux AST System (Inoculator and Analyzer).
Cross-Contamination Study for Selux Inoculator. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
the possible occurrence of cross-contamination of the Selux Inoculator during Selux
multiplex testing with various organisms. The Selux AST System instructions for use and
user interface were followed to inoculate individual panels using one QC isolate (E. faecalis
ATCC 2922, K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-2814, S. aureus ATCC 29213 or E. coli ATCC
25922) and one sterile saline sample (media only) in adjacent panels. Inoculated panels were
incubated overnight under standard growth-promoting conditions and the presence/absence
of growth was visually evaluated in wells inoculated with sterile saline.
The first set of testing included 12 total inoculator runs, with 2 gram-positive isolates/saline
samples and 2 gram-negative isolates/saline samples over three days. Purity plates were
conducted for all samples. This set of testing yielded growth in two wells on the saline plate
(2/1920 wells) and the cross-contamination study protocol was repeated for two additional
sets of testing. No additional growth occurred in any of the saline wells during the final
testing. MALDI-TOF species identification of the two wells with growth indicated that the
contaminants were S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Even though a root cause of the S.
epidermidis contamination was not determined, it was likely caused by user contamination
whereas S. aureus could have been due to cross contamination during sample preparation or
the inoculation process. The final contamination rate across all three rounds of testing was
determined to be 2/5760 wells (0.03%) which was determined to be acceptable.
Cross-Contamination Study for Selux AST System (Inoculator and Analyzer). The purpose
of this study was to evaluate the potential for cross-contamination during testing with the
entire Selux AST system (Inoculator and Analyzer). Two representative clinical samples, E.
coli and S. aureus, were used for testing. Testing comprised of 10 panels; five panels with E.
coli and five panels with S. aureus. The strains were processed to allow the gram-negative
and gram-positive samples to be alternated during inoculator processing. Purity plates were
prepared from the diluted troughs in the Selux inoculator. The MIC results from the AST
testing were compared to reference results from the Selux reference database. Performance
was evaluated by reviewing purity plates and AST results. The criteria to evaluate the
performance was set as acceptable for zero purity plate contamination caused by the other
species and >90% essential agreement (EA) compared with BMD results.
The purity plates did not show evidence of cross-contamination between E. coli and S.
aureus (i.e., single morphology colonies on each representative plate) and MIC results from
each species demonstrated 100% EA to the reference result. Additionally, the system did not
report any faults due to high background or viability contamination.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Clinical performance testing on the Selux AST System was initially performed at three U.S.
test sites (2 external, 1 internal). For instances in which testing was required to supplement
existing data from the original study and support specific claims, testing was performed on
three Selux AST System instruments at two testing sites.
Performance was evaluated using contemporary and stock frozen clinical isolates as well as
challenge isolates, which were selected for their resistance profiles. Clinical isolates of non-
fastidious bacteria were recovered from cultures of clinical specimens (e.g., blood, stool,
urine, respiratory, wound, aspirates) from diverse geographic locations across the U.S.
Contemporary frozen isolates were defined as isolates that had been collected and frozen
within six months of testing while stock frozen isolates were tested six or more months after
collection.
A total of 706 clinical (193 contemporary and 513 stock) and 159 challenge Staphylococcus
spp. and Enterococcus spp. isolates were tested to evaluate the Selux AST System
performance for 14 antimicrobials and one screening test using the Selux Gram-Positive
panel. Depending on the spectrum of activity, breakpoints and the claimed organisms
(species/group) for each antimicrobial on the panel, the number of datapoints for the various
antimicrobial-organisms tested varied and ranged from 39 (e.g. S. lugdunensis/Oxacillin) to
311 (e.g. Staphylococcus/Clindamycin). Selux results were compared to the modal value of
triplicate broth microdilution reference results performed at an independent reference
laboratory.
Performance was determined generally based on criteria outlined in the Class II Special
Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems including
essential agreement (EA), categorical agreement (CA), and categorical errors (minor, major
and very major errors). EA was calculated as the percentage of Selux MIC results that were
within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the reference result. CA was calculated as
the percentage of Selux interpretive results (S/I/R) that were identical to the interpretive
results of the reference result. EA of evaluable results (on-scale Selux and reference results
or results in which an off-scale result was at least two doubling dilutions from the on-scale
result) were also calculated. Performance was considered acceptable if the EA and CA were
≥90%, major error rate was ≤3%, and very major error rate was ≤2%.
A trending analysis using combined clinical and challenge isolate results was also conducted
to evaluate antimicrobial-organism combinations for which Selux MIC results were
determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher than the reference result.
MIC results that were off-scale for both the reference and Selux were not considered in the
trending analysis. Antimicrobial-organism combinations for which the difference between
the percentage of isolates with higher or lower MIC values was ≥ 30% with a statistically
significant confidence interval were considered to have evidence of trending and is addressed
in the labeling.

A high level summary of the performance of the Selux AST System is described below for
each antimicrobial and indicated species. Complete details and results including EA, CA and
error rate analyses are summarized in Tables 7 and 8 and trending analyses are summarized
in Table 9.
Ampicillin. A total of 299 Enterococcus spp. (115 E. faecalis and 184 E. faecium) isolates
were evaluated with ampicillin. The combined results from clinical and challenge isolate
testing demonstrated an EA of 98.3% and CA of 100%, which is acceptable. There were no
minor, major or very major errors. Overall, performance is acceptable. A limitation statement
is included in the device labeling to address the lack of testing with resistant E. faecalis
isolates.
Analysis of trending indicated that MIC values for Enterococcus spp. tended to be one
doubling dilution lower than the reference MIC value. The following statement is included as
a footnote to the AST performance table:
Selux MIC values for the following antimicrobial/organism combinations tended to
be one doubling dilution lower than the reference MIC value:
• Ampicillin: Enterococcus spp.
Cefoxitin Screen. A total of 151 S. aureus isolates were evaluated with the cefoxitin screen.
The combined results from clinical and challenge isolate testing demonstrated an CA of
98.7%, which is acceptable. There was one major error (1/71 = 1.4%) and one very major
error (1/80 = 1.3%), which is acceptable.
A total of 24 S. lugdunensis isolates were evaluated with the cefoxitin screen. The combined
results from clinical and challenge isolate testing demonstrated an CA of 95.8%, which is
acceptable. There were no very major errors; however, there was one major error (1/23 =
4.3%), which was considered a random error. The following footnote to the performance
table is included in the device labeling to address the major error:
When evaluating Selux AST System performance, there was a single major error
(MAJ) that resulted in an unacceptable MAJ rate of 4.3% (1/23) when cefoxitin
screen was tested with Staphylococcus lugdunensis.
In addition, a limitation statement is included in the device labeling to address the lack of
testing with resistant S. lugdunensis isolates.
Ceftaroline. A total of 138 S. aureus isolates were evaluated with the ceftaroline. The
combined results from clinical and challenge isolate testing demonstrated an EA and CA of
98.6%, which is acceptable. There was one major error (1/134 = 0.7%), one minor error and
no very major errors. Overall, performance is acceptable. A limitation statement is included
in the device labeling to address the lack of testing with resistant S. aureus isolates.
There was no evidence of trending observed for S. aureus with ceftaroline.
Clindamycin. A total of 311 Staphylococcus spp. isolates (including 145 S. aureus and 55 S.
epidermidis) were evaluated with clindamycin. The combined results from clinical and
K211759 - Page 16 of 30

--- Page 17 ---
challenge isolate testing demonstrated an EA of 95.8% and an CA of 97.1%, which is
acceptable. When evaluating results by individual species, S. aureus had one minor error and
one major error (1/118 = 0.8%), which is acceptable. S. epidermidis had two minor errors and
two major errors (2/31 = 6.5%) at a Selux MIC value of 4 μg/mL, which is not acceptable.
The following limitation is included in the device labeling to restrict reporting of S.
epidermidis due to the observed major errors:
Perform an alternative method of testing prior to reporting results for the following
antibiotic/organism combination(s):
• Clindamycin: Staphylococcus epidermidis when the Selux MIC is 4
µg/mL due to the occurrence of two major errors
There was no evidence of trending observed for S. aureus or S. epidermidis with
clindamycin.
Daptomycin. A total of 116 E. faecalis isolates were evaluated with daptomycin. The
combined results from clinical and challenge isolate testing demonstrated an EA of 94.0%
and an CA of 100%. There were no minor, major or very major errors. Overall, performance
is acceptable.
A total of 134 S. aureus isolates were evaluated with daptomycin. The combined results from
clinical and challenge isolate testing demonstrated an EA of 98.5% and an CA of 99.3%.
There was one very major error (1/1 = 100%) and no major or minor errors. The following
limitation is included in the device labeling to address the single non-susceptible isolate that
was found to be susceptible by Selux (potential very major error since no other category is
defined other than “susceptible only”):
The current absence of daptomycin-resistant isolates precludes defining any results
other than “Susceptible”. Isolates yielding results other than “Susceptible” should be
submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing. A single non-susceptible strain
of S. aureus provided a potential very major error during the comparative testing.
There was no evidence of trending observed for E. faecalis or S. aureus with daptomycin.
Delafloxacin. A total of 180 E. faecalis isolates were evaluated with delafloxacin. The
combined results from clinical and challenge isolate testing demonstrated an EA of 97.2%

errors. Overall, performance is acceptable.
A total of 229 Staphylococcus spp. isolates (218 S. aureus and 11 S. haemolyticus) were
evaluated with delafloxacin. The combined results from clinical and challenge isolate testing
demonstrated an EA of 99.1% and CA of 94.2%. There were no major, very major or minor
errors, which is acceptable. When evaluating results by individual species, S. haemolyticus
had a CA of 45.5% due to six minor errors at Selux MIC values of 0.25 μg/mL and 0.5
μg/mL. The following limitation is included in the device labeling to restrict reporting of S.

were evaluated with eravacycline. The combined results from clinical and challenge isolate
testing demonstrated a CA of 97.6% but an EA of 86.4% due to E. faecium which had an EA
of 81.5%. In addition, E. faecium had five major errors (5/168 = 3.0%) and two very major
errors (2/5 = 40%), which is not acceptable. In addition to a limitation to address the lack of
testing with resistant Enterococcus spp. isolates, the following limitation is included in the
device labeling to restrict reporting of E. faecium due to unacceptable performance:

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the reference method and Selux MIC results within plus or minus one
serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on-scale for both the Selux and the reference method or those
in which an off-scale result is at least two doubling dilutions from the on-scale result. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the
interpretation of the reference method and Selux result are in exact agreement.
1EA performance (<90%) is addressed in limitation statements, described above, and in the device labeling.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that Selux intends to
use to evaluate the Selux AST System when revised breakpoints for the following antimicrobials
are published on the FDA STIC webpage: Ampicillin, Ceftaroline, Clindamycin, Daptomycin,
Delafloxacin, Eravacycline, Erythromycin, Linezolid, Levofloxacin, Minocycline, Oxacillin,
Penicillin, Trimethoprim, Vancomycin, and Cefoxitin Screen.
The breakpoint change protocol included with the submission indicated that if specific criteria
are met, Selux will update the device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated
performance section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new
breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
