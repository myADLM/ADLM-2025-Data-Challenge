IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Sight OLO device was cleared under K190898. Since its original clearance, the designs and
components of the Sight OLO have remained the same, whereas the analysis software algorithms
of the Sight OLO have been updated. However, the Sight OLO remains a quantitative,
multiparameter, automated in vitro diagnostic hematology analyzer that screens whole blood
samples collected from venous and/or capillary blood and provides results for complete blood
count (CBC) parameters and a 5-part leukocyte differential.
The Sight OLO device is a compact computer vision-based platform for blood analysis. The
Sight OLO device consists of a scanning and analyzing unit and a CBC test kit, which includes a
disposable cartridge (1). The disposable cartridge contains an imaging chamber and a
hemoglobin (Hgb) measurement cavity. In addition to the disposable cartridge, the CBC test kit
also includes a mixing bottle (2) containing 1333 µL diluent and sealed with pierceable foil, a
dropper cap (3) integrated with 10 µL end-to-end micro-capillary and containing dried
fluorescent staining reagents, and a 17 µL micro-capillary (4, off the shelf). Pre-dilution and
staining of blood sample occurs in the mixing bottle and blood sample is added to the disposable
K211840 - Page 2 of 17

--- Page 3 ---
cartridge, which is then inserted into the device through the loading slot. Using dedicated
staining, the proposed platform provides CBC analysis. The device is operated through the touch
screen interface.
B Principle of Operation:
The Sight OLO device is a computer vision based platform for blood analysis. The platform
combines computer-vision algorithms for image processing to identify and quantify blood
components (e.g., red blood cells) and their characteristics (e.g., cell volume) in an automated
fashion.
The disposable cartridge loaded with whole blood sample is inserted into the device for
automatic staining and monolayer formation. The device uses computer-vision algorithms to
visually scan a stained blood sample under a florescence microscope. The device utilizes three
wavelengths bright-field images, and fluorescence mages to derive the complete blood count of
the sample. The captured images are analyzed, and the software identifies the visual differences
between the different blood components or abnormalities while relying on characteristics such as
intensity, size, shape, fluorescence intensity, and morphology. Hemoglobin is measured by a
unique channel in the device that measures the absorbance of undiluted whole blood in four
wavelengths. The technique is based on an absorbance optical measurement through a small
volume cavity with a short light path.
The Sight OLO device provides complete blood count information with 5-part differentials for
white blood cell types. Specifically, the CBC parameters measured by the Sight OLO device are
listed below and include: White Blood Cell Count (WBC), Red Blood Cell Count (RBC),
Hemoglobin (HGB), Hematocrit (HCT), Mean Cell Volume (MCV), Mean Cell Hemoglobin
(MCH), Mean Cell Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), RBC Distribution Width (RDW),
Platelet Count (PLT), Neutrophil Percent and Count (NEUT%/#), Lymphocyte Percent and
Count (LYMPH %/#), Monocyte Percent and Count (MONO %/#), Eosinophil Percent and
Count (EOS%/#), and Basophil Percent and Count (BASO%/#).
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Sight OLO
K211840 - Page 3 of 17

--- Page 4 ---
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is performed by use of a barcode reader or manually typing the
sample ID on the Sight OLO screen.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Sight OLO device can be used with either non-anticoagulated fingertip samples or
capillary and venous anticoagulated whole blood samples collected in K EDTA tubes.
2
Capillary blood sampling is performed by routine finger prick puncture following each user
facility’s standard guidelines. Per the Operator’s Manual, fingertip samples are collected
directly from the fingertip into the Sight OLO test kit microcapillaries. Venous and capillary
whole blood samples are collected into K EDTA tubes or microtubes (respectively) using
2
each user facility’s standard procedure. Venous and capillary whole blood should be
sufficiently mixed and stored at room temperature for less than eight hours before use.
4. Calibration:
The Sight OLO device is factory calibrated prior to shipping to the end user, and no further
calibration is needed. The calibration of Sight OLO is traceable to the reference methods
described in CLSI H26-A2.
5. Quality Control:
Whole blood quality control material OLO Control (three levels: high, medium, low)
provided by R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) is available for the Sight OLO to monitor the
performance of the analyzer. It is a stabilized whole blood matrix designed for statistical
process control of the Sight OLO.
Quality control range limits are downloaded automatically by an internet connection (or
configured locally by scan of QR codes printed on Quality Control product insert). Lot
expiration and results validity checks are done using the instrument software via the user
interface.

Deoxyhemoglobin
Since the previous clearance of the Sight OLO, an additional interferent, deoxyhemoglobin,
has been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to characterize the susceptibility of the
Sight OLO device to low blood oxygen saturation (i.e. lack of oxygen as an interferent) as a
potential endogenous interfering substance. The study was conducted using the same
protocol used previously in K190898. A total of 14 normal fresh venous whole blood
samples were used. Each sample was scanned three times (2 replicates each time) on each of
three Sight OLO devices. Each sample was scanned one time after undergoing mixing
procedure designed to ensure complete oxygen saturation of the sample (O2Hb > 90%), one
time under target reduced oxygen saturation (O2Hb 20-30%), and one time after resaturation
(O2Hb > 90%). The first replicate scan under target reduced oxygen saturation and the first
replicate scan after resaturation of each sample were used in the analysis. For each sample,
the bias was calculated for the following measurands: RBC, WBC, HGB, HCT and PLT,
which was determined by the differences between the samples with the interference
introduced (reduced oxygen saturation; O2Hb within 20-30%) versus the paired control
samples without the interference (full oxygen saturation; O2Hb >90%). Overall, the result
showed that there was no interference caused by reduction of oxyhemoglobin to 25% for the
following Sight OLO measurands: RBC, WBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT.

Test Kit Shelf-Life Stability
An ongoing stability study of the Test Kit following the same protocol described in K190898
has now reached the 18-month time point. The purpose of the real-time stability study is to
establish the shelf-life stability of the Sight OLO TK1 test kit when it is stored at its
recommended storage conditions (18–26˚C). Three lots of test kits were assessed for
functional and analytical tests on no more than five Sight OLO instruments. Each test kit lot
was stored at recommended temperature and tested at defined time points (4, 8, 12, 13, 18,
24, 26, 30, 36, 38 months), for a total of 11 time points per lot, including baseline
(manufacturing lot release served as time zero baseline). Current results support a shelf-life

stability claim of 18 months from time of production when stored at the recommended
temperature (18–26oC).
Device Calibration Stability
An ongoing calibration stability study of the Sight OLO following the same protocol
described in K190898 submission has reached a 15-month time point. The purpose of the
study was to establish the calibration stability of the Sight OLO over time. A total of 1,177
samples collected for the method comparison study were analyzed on 3 Sight OLO and 3
Sysmex XN-Series instruments at 3 clinical sites. Sample results within the 5 to 95 percentile
range per measurand (RBC, HGB, HCT, MCH, PLT, WBC, and MCV) were included in the
analysis and the relative errors of the Sight OLO to the Sysmex XN-Series were computed
per sample per measurand. Linear regression of the relative error versus the days since the
first samples was analyzed along with the 95% confidence bands were plotted and the results
compared to pre-defined acceptance criteria. Current results support a calibration stability
claim of 15 months.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study using 700 pediatric and adult samples covering the analytical
measurement range from three US sites was conducted. Both normal and pathological
samples were included in the assessment. The pathological samples included the following
conditions: acute inflammation, bacterial and viral infections, aplastic anemia, acute and
chronic leukemias (lymphocytic or myelocytic), multiple myeloma (plasma cell leukemia),
microcytic anemia, normocytic anemia, macrocytic anemia, hemoglobinopathies,
thalassemia, iron and folate deficiencies and giant platelets. The collected samples covered
an age range of 3 months to 94 years old, 32% of which were pediatric samples (3M-21Y).
The study population included 365 males (52%) and 335 females (48%).
Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed for each measurand with results from the
Sight OLO device against the results from the Sysmex XN-Series Hematology Analyzer. For
K211840 - Page 8 of 17

--- Page 9 ---
each regression analysis, the slope, intercept and the 95% two-sided confidence interval (CI)
around the slope and intercept were calculated, as well as the correlation coefficient. The
overall bias was calculated as the median of differences, where differences were taken either
as absolute or relative according to the nature of data. In addition, the predicted bias and its
95% CI at the medical decision points were calculated for WBC, HGB and PLT.
The analysis for the method comparison study was conducted on the data from each of the
three sites and all sites combined, and only the results of the latter were compared to the
acceptance criteria. The results showed that all measurands met the prespecified acceptance
criteria for correlation, bias, slope, intercept (and the 95% two-sided confidence interval (CI)
around the slope and intercept). Overall, the method comparison results demonstrate that,
like the original cleared Sight OLO, the Sight OLO with updated algorithms generates
comparable results to the predicate Sysmex XN-Series device.

Concordance Analysis at Medical Relevant Points
The results of the method comparison studies demonstrated there were constant bias and
proportional bias for some measurands. Therefore, for each medical relevant point, a truth
table with Bayesian analysis was performed to calculate the positive percent agreement
(PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA) and overall percent agreement (OPA) between the
Sight OLO and the Sysmex XN-Series Analyzer (all tables shown below). Based on the
expert clinician review, none of the observed discordances would affect clinical decision
making for the specific patients.

2. Matrix Comparison:
A capillary vs. venous matrix comparison study consisting of 67 normal and pathological
paired capillary K2EDTA whole blood and venous K2EDTA whole blood specimens were
used. Paired specimens collected from the same individuals were assayed in duplicate on the
OLO device to compare performance between capillary whole blood samples and venous
whole blood samples, and the results were analyzed for all applicable measurands. Analysis
included Passing-Bablok regression analysis per measurand (Bland Altman plots, slope,
intercept, with 95% confidence intervals, correlation coefficient, and % bias), between the
average of two venous whole blood sample repeats and the average of two capillary whole
blood sample repeats from the same individual on the Sight OLO. Overall, the study results
from the Sight OLO device show comparable performance characteristics for K2EDTA
capillary and K2EDTA venous whole blood samples.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
A flagging study was conducted, comparing the Sight OLO to manual light microscopy for
normal (no flags) and abnormal (flags present) for 108 normal samples and 100 abnormal
samples at three clinical study sites. Three blood films were prepared for each sample. Two
qualified morphology examiners evaluated one of the three blood films. In each blood film a
200-cell count was performed for a total of 400 cells for the two examiners together. Two
types of abnormalities were evaluated: (1) distributional abnormal samples, which are
samples where the quantity of at least one of the WBC diffs% parameters reside outside of
the normal concentrations, and (2) morphological abnormal samples, which are samples that
contain atypical forms of the normal cell types in ordinary blood samples. Three Sight OLO
instruments were used for the study (one at each site) and one lot of Sight OLO test kits was
used. Overall, the flagging capability of the Sight OLO device met the pre-defined
acceptance criteria for both overall sensitivity and specificity.
