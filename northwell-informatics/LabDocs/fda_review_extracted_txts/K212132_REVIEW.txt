III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is a real time continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) device with alarms capability indicated for the management of diabetes in
persons age 4 and older. It is intended to replace blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment
decisions, unless otherwise indicated.
The System also detects trends and tracks patterns and aids in the detection of episodes of
hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments.
Interpretation of the System readings should be based on the glucose trends and several
sequential readings over time.
The System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally connected devices.
The System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected devices where the
user manually controls actions for therapy decisions.
C Contraindication(s)
Due to an administrative error, the reference to wear period was erroneously included in the
Contraindications section of the previous 510(k) Decision Summary. It is now removed from this
section and added to the Special Conditions for Use Statements section below.
The System must not be used with automated insulin dosing (AID) systems, including closed
loop and insulin suspend systems.
The System must be removed prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed
Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The effect of
MRI, CT scans, or diathermy on the performance of the System has not been evaluated. The
exposure may damage the Sensor and may impact proper function of the device which could
cause incorrect readings.
D Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The sensor can be worn up to 14 days. Remember to always have your next Sensor available
before your current one ends so you can keep getting your glucose readings.
Do not use the System in people less than 4 years of age. The System is not cleared for use in
people under 4 years of age.
Do not use the System if you are pregnant, on dialysis, or critically ill. The System is not cleared
for use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or medications common to
these populations may affect performance of the System.
The FreeStyle Libre 3 app installed on a phone is intended for use by a single person. It must not
be used by more than one person due to the risk of misinterpreting glucose information.
K212132 - Page 2 of 25

--- Page 3 ---
Performance of the System when used with other implanted medical devices, such as
pacemakers, has not been evaluated.
Taking ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise Sensor
glucose readings. Taking more than 500 mg of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor
readings which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event. Ascorbic acid can be found
in supplements including multivitamins. Some supplements, including cold remedies such as
Airborne® and Emergen-C®, may contain high doses of 1000 mg of ascorbic acid and should
not be taken while using the Sensor. See your health care professional to understand how long
ascorbic acid is active in your body.
Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: if you are experiencing
symptoms that are not consistent with the glucose readings, consult your health care
professional.
Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the symbol
during the first 12 hours of wearing a Sensor, if your Sensor glucose reading does not match how
you feel or if the reading does not include a number.
For you to receive alarms, they must be on and your device should be within 33 feet of you at all
times. The transmission range is 33 feet unobstructed. If you are out of range, you may not
receive alarms.
If you suspect that the temperature may exceed 82°F (for example, in an unairconditioned home
in summer), you should refrigerate your Sensor Kit. Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.
Do not force close the App. The App must be running in the background to receive alarms. If
you force close the App you will not receive alarms. Re-open the App to ensure you will receive
alarms.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is an integrated continuous glucose
monitoring system (iCGM) that provides continuous glucose measurements every minute to provide
glucose levels, trends, and alerts. The System consists of the following components: a Sensor which
transmits via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and a mobile application, FreeStyle Libre 3 App,
downloaded to a compatible smartphone running on iOS operating system. When used with the FSL
3 the proposed mobile app allows the user to activate FSL3 sensors, provides real-time glucose
measurements (glucose values) accompanied by trend information (glucose arrows) and historical
glucose information (glucose graph) thus allowing the user may make treatment decisions, and
connect with cloud-based applications to store as shareable data (e.g. LibreView).
System Components and Features
Alarms: The FSL3 App can issue the following glucose and system alarms:
K212132 - Page 3 of 25

--- Page 4 ---
• Mandatory Alarms: Urgent Low Glucose, Replace Sensor, Sensor Ended, App Stopped
(Force Closed)
These alarms cannot be turned off or modified and will always sound regardless of
o
the phone’s sound and vibe or Do Not Disturb (DND) settings.
• Optional Alarms: Low Glucose Alarm, High Glucose Alarm, Signal Loss Alarm
For the optional alarms above, the Override DND setting is turned on by default;
o
therefore, the user receives these alarms regardless of the phone’s sound, vibe or
DND settings. If the user wishes to have the optional alarms follow the phone’s
sound and vibe settings, the user must turn off Override DND from the App.
Hardware / Software compatibility: The FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System
is intended for use with Field Communication (NFC) and BLE-enabled smartphones running
compatible iOS. The FSL3 app is compatible with FSL3 Sensors.
Secondary Viewers: LibreView and LibreLinkUp (LLU) provide a cloud-based repository for
glucose measurement data and mobile app that allows caregivers to receive and view glucose data
(including glucose alarms) from users who use the FSL3 App with their sensor. Secondary viewers
are not intended to be used for immediate clinical decision making.
B Principle of Operation:
The FreeStyle Libre 3 System provides the user with real-time glucose measurements (glucose
values) accompanied by trend information (glucose arrows) and historic 12-hour glucose results
(glucose graph) that are presented on the App. The real-time glucose measurements and glucose
arrows are calculated by the Sensor software based upon glucose sampling, also performed by the
Sensor.
The Sensor is designed to measure glucose levels in the user’s interstitial fluid through an
amperometric electrochemical sensor component. The sensor tail is inserted into the subcutaneous
tissue and generates an electrical current via the oxidation of glucose from the interstitial fluid. The
FreeStyle Libre 3 System is intended for single patient use. The App can only pair to one Sensor at a
time. The Sensor is disposable and may be worn up to 14 days. The Sensor automatically terminates
after 14 days of use.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The iCGM performance was evaluated in clinical studies described below in section C(3) below.
A sub-set of study participants wore two sensors concurrently, one on the back of each upper
arm, to evaluate device precision for a period of up to 14 days.
For adults, the paired absolute relative difference (PARD) between the two Sensors was 5.9% with
coefficient of variation (CV) of 4.2%. For children ages 4-5, PARD was 4.7% with CV of 3.3%. For
children ages 6-17, PARD was 8.1% with CV of 5.7%. Paired absolute difference (PAD) is a
measurement of absolute difference (in mg/ dL) between paired CGM readings, while PARD is the
absolute relative difference (in %) between paired CGM readings.

2. Linearity:
See Assay Reportable Range below.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Previously established in K193371. Refer to warnings in the labeling for risks associated with
ascorbic acid (vitamin C) interference.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range for the FreeStyle Libre 3 System is 40 to 400 mg/dL. Data supporting
this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3)
below.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor has a storage shelf-life of 3 months. Shelf-life was evaluated at
36°–82° Fahrenheit within the humidity range of 10% - 90%.
6. Detection Limit:
If a glucose measurement is less than 40 mg/dL, the result will be displayed by the system as
‘LO’. If the glucose measurement exceeds 400 mg/dL, the result will be displayed as ‘HI’. Data
supporting this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in
Section C(3) below.

Study 3 was conducted at 4 centers in the US with 100 adult and pediatric subjects in total (83.0
% Type 1, 17.0% Type 2). All subjects required insulin to manage their diabetes. 56 adult
subjects were aged 18 and older, 39 pediatric subjects were aged six to seventeen and 5 pediatric
subjects were aged four to five. 81 subjects were analyzed during the beginning of the Sensor
wear period (day 1, 2 or 3), 46 subjects were analyzed during the early middle period (day 7 or
8), 47 subjects were analyzed during the late middle period (day 9 or 12), and 34 subjects were
analyzed during the end period (day 13 or 14).
Subjects aged six and older had their venous blood glucose analyzed for up to 16 hours over one
or two separate visits to the clinical center. Each visit lasted up to eight hours. The venous blood
samples were analyzed using a laboratory reference method, the Yellow Springs Instrument Life
Sciences 2300 STAT Plus™ Glucose & Lactate Analyzer (YSI). Self-monitoring blood glucose
meter (SMBG) was used as the comparator method for subjects 4-5 years of age.
Glucose values were obtained from the system and from the comparator at the same or
similar time. Data from Study 1 (the adult Libre 2 study) was combined with data from the adult
cohort in Study 3, and data from Study 2 (the pediatric Libre 2 study) was combined with data
from the pediatric cohort in Study 3.
For values below 70 mg/dL, absolute differences in mg/dL were compared to the comparator
method. For values of 70 mg/dL and above, percentage differences compared to the comparator
method were calculated.

Trend Accuracy
Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose
and is characterized by slopes, such as from > 2mg/dL/min to <-2 mg/dL/min. Trend accuracy
was assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change from the iCGM and the
corresponding comparator values for each iCGM-comparator measurement pair.

Agreement when iCGM reads “LO” or “HI”
The FreeStyle Libre 3 Glucose Monitoring System reports glucose readings between 40 and 400
mg/dL. When the system determines that the glucose reading is below 40 mg/dL, it will display
‘LO’ whenever the sensor is scanned. When the system determines that the glucose reading is
above 400 mg/dL, it will display ‘HI’ whenever the sensor is scanned. Because the system does
not display glucose values below 40 mg/dL or above 400 mg/dL, the comparisons to the actual
blood glucose levels (as determined by the comparator) when the iCGM value is classified as
‘LO’ or ‘HI’ are evaluated separately. The cumulative percentages of when the comparator
values were less than certain glucose values (for ‘LO’) and when comparator values were more
that certain glucose values (for ‘HI’) are presented in the tables below.

Alarm Performance
The tables in this section show the accuracy of the System’s Low and High Glucose Alarms.
The Alarm Rate tells the user how often the alarm is right or wrong. The Detection Rate tells
the user how often the System is able to recognize and notify the user about a low or high
glucose event (within 15 minutes before or after the event).
Low Glucose Alarm Performance
True Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was below the
alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.
False Alarm Rate: Percentage of time the alarm issued, and blood glucose was not below the
alarm level within 15 minutes before or after the alarm.
Detection Rate: Percentage of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the alarm
issued within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.
Missed Detection Rate: Amount of time blood glucose was below the alarm level and the
alarm didn’t issue within 15 minutes before or after the glucose event.

Sensor Stability
Sensor stability describes the performance of the sensor over the sensor lifetime. Sensors can be
worn for up to 14 days. Performance was estimated by calculating the mean of the absolute
relative differences between iCGM and comparator measurement and percentage of device
readings within 15 mg/dL or 15% (15/15%), 20 mg/dL or 20% (20/20%) and 40 mg/dL or 40%
(40/40%) of the comparator values during the beginning, early middle, late middle, and end of
the wear period. These times were defined as follows:
• Beginning (Adult Days 1-3, Pediatric: Days 1-2)
• Early Middle (Adult: Days 7-8, Pediatric: Days 7-8),
• Late Middle (Adult: Days 9-12, Pediatric: Days 9-12), and
• End (Adult: Days 13-14, Pediatric: Days 13-14).

The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and agreement rates with the comparator method
were evaluated over 14-day life of the sensor. For these tables the adult data for FreeStyle Libre
2 study were combined with the adult data for FreeStyle Libre 3. The same approach was also
implemented for pediatric subjects.

Sensor Life
The Sensor can be worn for up to 14 days. To estimate how long a Sensor will work over the
wear duration, 101 Sensors were evaluated in Study 3 to determine how many days of readings
each Sensor provided. Of the 56 Sensors used in adults, 66.1% lasted until the final day; while of
the 45 sensors used in pediatric patients, 71.1% lasted until the final day. Abbott performed a
retrospective analysis and concluded that the survival rate of the FSL3 in Study 3 was negatively
affected by a software configuration unique to the investigational device, and that the actual
survival rates should be higher.

A subsequent study was conducted in adults to assess the impact of this software configuration
on early sensor shut-off as well as to determine the survival rate after eliminating for physical
factors (e.g., getting caught in car seat belt, accidental knocking off the sensor etc.). A total of 34
of the 39 (87.2%) of the sensors gave glucose results over the entire intended wear period of 14
days. After correcting for several factors, the actual survival rate was 94.4 %.

alignment with FDA guidance, “Design Considerations and Pre-market Submission
Recommendations for Interoperable Medical Devices,” September 6, 2017, which includes
expectations, requirements, and interface specifications to potential interoperable devices. In
addition, the ADC approach to interoperability includes working with connected device
companies regarding contractual approaches, interfaces for data communication and exchange,
and post-market reporting procedures and responsibilities with respect to managing complaints
(e.g., who is responsible for investigating and reporting complaints, malfunctions, and adverse
events).
Cybersecurity
ADC has provided cybersecurity risk management documentation for the System that includes
analysis of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for data, information and software related to the
System accordance with FDA Draft Guidance “Content of Premarket Submissions for Management
of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices.” For each identified threat and vulnerability risk event scenario,
risk assessment of impact to confidentiality integrity, and availability was performed and
documented within the cybersecurity risk management documentation. Appropriate risk mitigation
controls have been implemented and tested.
In addition, ADC has controls and processes in place to ensure continued support for keeping the
device secure and to ensure that the device firmware, software and components are malware free.
Additional controls are also in place in manufacturing through distribution to ensure that the
medical device firmware and software are malware free from point of origin to the hands of the
end user.
Wireless Coexistence
The FreeStyle Libre 3 System underwent coexistence testing in the presence of common RF
interfering devices that are likely to be encountered by users in a home environment. Wireless
coexistence testing was performed to confirm that the Patch remains functional and perform within
acceptable limits while in the presence of common radiating electronic devices in accordance with
FDA Guidance “Radio Frequency Wireless Technology in Medical Devices.” A representative set of
devices known to operate in the same frequency band (2.4 GHz) was selected. The subject device
underwent coexistence testing consistent with AAMI TIR69 and ANSI C63.27 and included test
challenges from in-band interference sources defined in ANSI C63.27 as well as other expected
wireless interference sources from the intended use environment. The test results showed that the
FreeStyle Libre 3 System could tolerate interference generated by these RF interfering devices
and still meet the target performance criteria.
