IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The GlucoSure Link blood glucose monitoring system (model number BGM024) consists of the
GlucoSure Link meter, GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Test Strips and Contrex Plus glucose
control solutions (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3). The GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Test Strips
and Contrex Plus glucose control solution are available for purchase separately.
B Principle of Operation:
The GlucoSure Link blood glucose monitoring system quantitatively measures glucose
amperometrically, using test strips containing an enzyme (Glucose Oxidase). Glucose in the
whole blood sample applied to the test strip reacts with the glucose oxidase. The electrons
generated during this reaction are detected by the meter. The meter applies a small electrical
current to the test strip and measures changes in the current caused by the reaction of glucose in
the blood sample to the enzyme in the test strip. The magnitude of the resultant current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the blood and is converted to a glucose
concentration. The glucose concentration is displayed on the meter’s display. The test results are
plasma-calibrated.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose meter
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The system is intended to be used with capillary whole blood samples drawn from the
fingertips, forearm, or palm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by
capillary action and samples are to be tested immediately upon collection.
4. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The meter is automatically
coded.
5. Quality Control:
Contrex Plus Glucose Control Solutions (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3) are available for use

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A within-run precision study using 3 lots of GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose test strips was
performed. Venous blood was spiked to 5 concentrations (i.e., Level 1: 30-50 mg/dL, Level
2: 51-110 mg/dL, Level 3: 111-150 mg/dL, Level 4: 151-250 mg/dL, and Level 5: 251-400
mg/dL). For each sample concentration, 10 GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose meters were
used, with 10 measurements taken by each meter for a total of 300 test for each glucose level.
Results are summarized below:
Control Mean
N SD (mg/dL) CV (%)
Levels (mg/dL)
L1 300 46 2.6 5.6
L2 300 89 3.0 3.3
L3 300 120 3.5 2.9
L4 300 221 5.1 2.3
L5 300 328 5.1 1.6
Intermediate precision was evaluated using 3 lots of the GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose test
strips and five levels of control solutions (i.e., Level 1: 30-50 mg/dL, Level 2: 51-110 mg/dL,
Level 3: 111-150 mg/dL, Level 4: 151-250 mg/dL, and Level 5: 251-400 mg/dL). Each
sample was measured in replicates of 10 using 10 GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose meters
over ten days resulting in a total of 300 tests for each glucose level. Results are summarized
below:
Control Mean
N SD (mg/dL) CV (%)
Levels (mg/dL)
L1 300 40 1.6 3.9%
L2 300 69 2.0 2.9%
L3 300 121 2.0 1.7%
L4 300 222 2.2 1.0%

2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated using venous whole blood adjusted to eleven glucose levels at 19.7,
50.1, 80.7, 115, 160, 200, 260, 310, 420, 530, and 610 mg/dL (as measured by the
comparator method, YSI 2300) and 3 GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose test strip lots. The
GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System results were compared with the values
obtained from the comparator method. The results from the regression analysis are
summarized below:
Lot 1: y = 0.9972x-0.1961, R2=0.9985
Lot 2: y = 1.0035x-1.0736, R2=0.9984
Lot 3: y = 1.0027x-0.8429, R2=0.9983
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to
600 mg/dL. If a sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as “LO”. If a
sample result is more than 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as “HI”. The low
and high functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference testing was conducted to evaluate the effect of endogenous substances and
common exogenous substances expected in the intended use population on the GlucoSure
Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The study was designed using venous whole blood
samples adjusted to 3 target glucose levels (50-70 mg/dL, 110-130 mg/dL, and 225-270
mg/dL). Samples were divided into a test pool with the potential interferent added and a
control sample with no added interferent. The difference between the test and control sample
results was calculated and the concentration at which no significant interference (defined as
average % bias ≤ 10%) was observed is listed in the table below:

Method Comparison/User Evaluation study:
To assess the performance of the GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the
hands of the intended users, the sponsor conducted a user evaluation study consisting of 350
lay user participants who tested fingertip, palm and forearm capillary samples. Participants
independently self-tested following only the product labeling in English. Three GlucoSure
Link Blood Glucose test strip lots were used in the study. The results were analyzed by
comparing the capillary blood glucose values obtained by the lay users to results obtained on
the comparator method (YSI Model 2300 Glucose Analyzer). For fingerstick, palm and
forearm samples, the glucose concentrations across all samples ranged from 63 to 485
mg/dL, which includes 40 native samples < 80 mg/dL and 251 samples > 250 mg/dL as
K212140 - Page 8 of 12

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1) System operating conditions (temperature, humidity):
The GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System was tested at different
temperature and humidity conditions to assess the effect of the operation environment on
the performance of the system. Temperatures ranging from 50 - 104°F (10 - 40°C) and 20
–85% relative humidity were tested. Five temperature and humidity combinations were
tested including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high
temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high humidity. Venous whole blood
glucose levels (60, 120, 200, and 400 mg/dL) were tested using 10 meters and 3 lots of
GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose test strips. Values measured by the GlucoSure Link
Blood Glucose Monitoring System were compared to the results obtained using the
comparator method, the YSI 2300 method. The study results support the labeled
operating conditions claim of 50-104°F (10-40°C) and 20-85% RH.
2) Sample Volume Study:
The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume of 1.0
μL for the GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood
samples with 3 glucose concentrations (50-65, 100-120 and 200-250 mg/dL) were tested
at 5 sample volumes (0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 μL) using 3 lots of GlucoSure Link Blood
Glucose test strips and 10 GlucoSure Link meters. Values obtained were compared to the
results obtained using the comparator method (YSI 2300 Glucose analyzer). Results
support the claimed minimum sample volume of 1.0 μL for the system. The meter
displays an error message if enough blood is not added to the test strip. This feature was
validated and was shown to function as intended.
3) Hematocrit Study:
The effect of hematocrit on the performance of the GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose
Monitoring System was evaluated at 30%, 35%, 42%, 50%, and 55% hematocrit levels,
and at 5 glucose concentrations (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250 and 251-400 mg/dL).
Each sample was tested in replicates of 10 using 10 meters and 3 lots of GlucoSure Link
Blood Glucose test strips, for a total of 30 replicates per sample. The values were
compared with the glucose measurements obtained using the comparator method (YSI
2300 Glucose analyzer). The results of the study demonstrated adequate performance to
support the claimed hematocrit range of 30%-55%.
4) Altitude Study:
A high-altitude study was conducted where the effects of sea level (<500 ft) and high-
altitude (10,000 ft) were simulated and the effects on the GlucoSure Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were evaluated. Venous whole blood samples adjusted to 5 glucose
concentrations (50, 120, 220, 330, and 450 mg/dL) were tested using 10 meters and 3 lots
of GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose test strips. Values measured by the candidate device
were compared with the glucose measurements obtained with the comparator method
(YSI 2300 Glucose analyzer). The results of the study support the claim that the

GlucoSure Blood Glucose Monitoring System can be operated at altitudes of up to 10,000
ft.
5) Flex Studies:
Flex studies were performed demonstrating that the GlucoSure Link Blood Glucose
Monitoring System is robust to short sample application, sample perturbation, testing
with used test strips, intermittent sampling, drop and vibration.
6) Infection Control Studies:
The device system is intended for single patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were
previously performed (k150396) with the external meter materials by an outside
commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) or removal of HBsAg with the following disinfectants: Clorox Healthcare Bleach
Germicidal and Disinfectant Wipes (EPA Registration Number: 67619-12), Dispatch
Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach (EPA Registration Number: 56392-8),
Medline Micro-Kill+ Disinfecting, Deodorizing, Cleaning Wipes with Alcohol (EPA
Registration Number: 59894-10), and Medline Micro-Kill Bleach Germicidal Bleach
Wipes (EPA Registration Number: 69687-1-37549). The sponsor also conducted
robustness studies demonstrating that there was no change in performance or to the
external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles (representing
weekly disinfection for five years, the expected lifetime of the meter). Labeling was
reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
7) The sponsor provided acceptable documentation certifying that acceptable electrical
safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing was performed with the
candidate system and the system was found to be compliant.
8) Test strip lot release criteria: The test strip lot release protocols and criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling does supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and does support a
substantial equivalence decision.
