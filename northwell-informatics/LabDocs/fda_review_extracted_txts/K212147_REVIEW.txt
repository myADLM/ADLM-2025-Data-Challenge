COVID-19.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa COVID-19 Direct is a real-time RT-PCR assay intended for
use on the LIAISON MDX instrument for the in vitro qualitative detection of nucleic acid from
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS)
and nasal swabs (NS)] from symptomatic individuals suspected of COVID 19 by their healthcare
provider. The Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay is an aid in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2
infection.
Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Clinical correlation with
patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status.
Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other pathogens.
Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis
for patient management decisions.
Results are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory
data, in accordance with the guidelines provided by the relevant public health authorities.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Simplexa COVID-19 Direct is a real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) system that enables the direct
amplification and detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) RNA from nasopharyngeal swab or
nasal swab specimens that have not undergone nucleic acid extraction.
The test system consists of the following:
• Simplexa COVID-19 Direct reaction mix, (DNA polymerase, reverse transcriptase,
RNase inhibitor, buffer, dNTPs, encapsulated RNA template (Internal Control),
K212147 - Page 2 of 22

--- Page 3 ---
fluorescent probes and corresponding forward and reverse primers specific for detection
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and for the RNA Internal Control.)
• Direct Amplification Disc (DAD), which has eight (8) separate wedges where up to
eight specimens (or controls) may be processed on each disc. Each wedge contains
sample and reagent input wells, microfluidic channels and laser activated valves to
control the fluid flow, and a reaction chamber.
• Control Pack - Simplexa COVID-19 Positive Control Gen II Pack
• LIAISON MDX instrument, a real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
thermocycler used for the identification of nucleic acids from biological specimens. The
LIAISON MDX instrument is controlled by an external computer running the LIAISON
MDX Studio Software and uses real-time fluorescence detection to identify targets within
the sample wells of a Direct Amplification Disc (DAD).
The LIAISON MDX, previously referred to as 3M Integrated Cycler, was cleared
o
under K102314.
B Principle of Operation:
The assay uses forward and reverse primers and associated fluorescent probe(s) included in the
reaction mix to amplify SARS-CoV-2 cDNA reverse transcribed from RNA. The primers and
probe sets are designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab and S gene from the viral RNA in
nasopharyngeal swab or nasal swab. An RNA internal control, with associated primers and a
fluorescent probe, is included in the reaction mix to detect RT-PCR failure and/or inhibition.
To start processing a patient sample, the user adds 50 μL of Reaction Mix to the reagent input
well (R) on the DAD using a pipette, followed by 50 μL of unextracted specimen to the sample
input well (SAMPLE). A DAD with reagents and sample(s) is subsequently loaded on the
LIAISON MDX. Centrifugal force aboard the LIAISON MDX moves the fluid into the metering
chamber of the DAD. The reagent chamber is specifically designed to measure 40 μL of reagent
and the sample chamber is specifically designed to measure 10 μL of sample. Excess reagent and
sample are forced into the waste chambers by centrifugal force.
After the centrifugal force has mixed the sample and reagent within the reaction chamber, coat
protein denaturation, reverse transcription and PCR amplification cycles begin. In the process,
the probe anneals to a specific target sequence located between the forward and reverse primers.
During the extension phase of the PCR cycle, the 5’ nuclease activity of DNA polymerase
degrades the probe, causing the reporter dye to separate from the quencher dye, generating a
fluorescent signal. The S gene probe has a FAM fluorophore and the ORF1ab gene probe has
JOE fluorophore. Fluorescence intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle by detection modules
in the LIAISON MDX. A sample is considered positive for a particular target if intensity of the
optical reading crosses a particular threshold before a predetermined cut-off cycle. Results are
obtained by using the LIAISON MDX Studio software version 1.1 or above. According to the
result interpretation if at least one target (S gene or ORF1ab) is Detected for the sample then the
sample is positive for SARS-CoV-2.
An RNA internal control, with associated primers and a fluorescent probe, is included in the
reaction mix to detect RT-PCR failure and/or inhibition.

Reproducibility of the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct
The reproducibility study was conducted at three intended use sites (two external and one
internal /in-house), over a period of five testing days, using one lot of reagents, with testing
performed by two operators at each site. The test panel consisted of five panel members: one
low positive (1-2x LoD), one medium positive (3-5x LoD), contrived with COVID-19 strain
USA-WA1/2020, a negative sample (UTM as NTC), and one positive Control Sample
prepared in clinical (NPS) matrix. Each sample was tested in three replicates once per day by
each operator, for a total of 90 measurements per sample (3 sites x 2 users x 5 days x 3
reps=90 measurements). A total of five LIAISON MDX instruments (at least one per site)
were used in the study. The table below summarizes the results from the reproducibility

Lot-to-lot Reproducibility of the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct Kit
The lot-to-lot reagent reproducibility of the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct kit was evaluated in
a study conducted at one internal site, over a period of 12 non-consecutive days (18-23 and
25-30 January 2021), using three lots of Simplexa COVID-19 Direct kit, two lots of
Simplexa COVID-19 Gen II Positive Control, with testing performed by two operators at the
site. The test panel consisted of four panel members: one low positive (1-2x LoD) and one
medium positive (3-5x LoD), each contrived with 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 strain, a
negative sample (UTM as No Template Control), and one Positive Control sample (from
Control Pack) prepared in negative clinical (NPS) matrix. Each sample was tested in
duplicate per kit lot per run, in two runs per day, for a total of 12 non-consecutive days (2
replicates/kit lot x 3 kit lots/run x 2 runs/day x 12 days=144 /sample panel member). A total
of two LIAISON MDX instruments were used in the study. The tables below summarize the
results from the inter-lot precision study for the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct kit, showing the
mean Ct values and calculated SD and %CV for each panel member.

The precision of the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct Gen II Positive Control kit for the lot-to-lot
reagent reproducibility were evaluated in a study conducted at one internal site, over a period
of 12 non-consecutive days (18-23 and 25-30 January 2021) using one lot of Simplexa
COVID-19 Direct kit, three lots of Simplexa COVID-19 Gen II Positive Control with testing
performed by two operators at the site, using one LIAISON MDX instrument. Forty eight
(48) replicates of each of three lots of the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct Gen II Positive
Control were tested for both channels (S gene [FAM] and ORF1ab gene [JOE]) and were
detected in each of the 144 total replicates.
The table below summarizes the results from the inter lot precision study (Simplexa COVID-
19 Direct Gen II Positive Control kit), showing the mean Ct values and calculated SD and
%CV for each panel member.

bacteria or fungi at 1x106 CFU/mL (where possible). Each organism was tested in triplicate.
All three SARS-CoV-2 assay targets were expected to be negative in each replicate and any
invalid runs due to failure of controls or instrument/software errors were to be repeated. A
total of 47 different organisms were tested in addition to the human nasal fluid which closely
represents diverse microbial flora and human genomic DNA.
In silico (BLAST) analysis was performed for Bacillus anthracis, Influenza C and
Pneumocystis jirovecii as these organisms were not available for wet testing. Human
coronavirus 229E, human coronavirus NL63, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and
Leptospira interrogans could not be sourced at the specified concentration so it was
supplemented by in silico analysis.
A summary of the cross-reactivity evaluation is shown below. No cross-reactivity was
detected for any of the organisms tested (i.e., 0/3 detection for each assay/replicate/analyte).

Interference
Simplexa COVID-19 Direct was tested for potential interference by substances that may be
present in respiratory specimens. Test samples were contrived in clinical NPS matrix, spiked
with SARS-CoV-2(2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 strain at 3x LoD (1500cp/ml) and adding
the potentially interfering substances at concentrations shown below. Each test sample was
run in triplicate at one site using four LIAISON MDX instruments by three operators, over
the course of six days. No interference was observed at the tested concentrations. The
following table provides the substances and concentrations tested. The FluMist nasal vaccine
was not tested as it was unavailable at the time of the study. A limitation regarding FluMist
evaluation is added to the assay labeling.

Microbial Interference:
Simplexa COVID-19 Direct was evaluated for ability to identify SARS-CoV-2 when other
potentially cross-reacting organisms were present. Potentially cross-reacting organisms were
individually spiked into a pool of negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix with a low
concentration of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 at approximately two times the limit of detection
(2x LoD). Except for Lactobacillus plantarum 17-5, no inhibition by other organisms was
observed at the tested concentration. Testing Lactobacillus plantarum 17-5 at a lower
concentration (5 x 105 CFU/mL) resulted in no inhibition.

Fresh versus frozen Study:
A fresh vs. frozen study was designed for the candidate device to determine the assay
performance testing NPS swabs in UTM and saline after freezing. SARS-CoV2 negative
NPS swab samples in UTM/saline were used to prepare negative or positive samples spiked
with heat-inactivated SARS-COV-2 viral particles from the 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020
strain at two concentrations (10 samples at 5x LoD and 30 samples at 2x LoD). All samples
were tested fresh prior to freezing for 24 hrs at ≤ 70°; up to three freeze/thaw cycles
following the storage condition, as described below.
The Fresh vs. Frozen study was conducted for each time point and showed a 100% detection
(positivity) for samples prepared at 5x LoD (except for time point C, one replicate at 5X LoD
at time point C gave negative result initially; the same replicate was repeated on the same day
on two different runs with successful detection of all targets.), ≥95% detection (positivity) for
samples prepared at 2x LoD and 0% detection of all negative (un-spiked) samples.
Specimen Stability:
Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) collected in UTM and in saline were tested as negative or as
contrived positive samples by spiking the heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral particles from
the 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 strain (ATCC, Manassas, VA) at two different
concentrations: 2x and 5x LoD. Samples were tested fresh, then stored refrigerated (2-8˚C)
and tested in 10 replicates at Day 3, Day 5, Day 7, and Day 10.
Each sample were frozen and tested for up to three days for three freeze-thaw cycles. The
study data supported sample storage at 2-8 °C for up to 7 days post collection and if there is a
delay the specimens can be stored at -70 °C for up to three days. for three freeze thaw cycles
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) in NPS and NS samples was determined using heat inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020) spiked into clinical NPS and NS specimens in UTM. LoD is
defined as the lowest concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that can be detected at a rate of at
least 95%. Tentative LoD was determined using serial dilutions of inactivated virus in NPS

Study Results with WHO International Standard Material:
An additional LoD study was done using the SARS-CoV-2 WHO International Standard
virus particles to further evaluate the sensitivity of the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct. The
tentative LoD was identified with serial dilutions of the viral particles in NPS matrix. The
final LoD was confirmed to be the lowest concentration quantified in International Units per
milliliter (IU/mL) resulting in positive detection with a minimum 95% positivity.

7. Analytical Reactivity:
In silico
An in silico inclusivity analysis of the oligonucleotide (oligo) sequences for the SARS-CoV-
2 ORF1ab and S gene sets were performed against all SARS-CoV-2 sequences available in
the GISAID database submitted from November 01, 2021 to January 31, 2022 and February
01, 2022 to April 30, 2022. The analysis included 2,170,584 and 377,668 sequences in the
amplicon regions of the ORF1ab and S gene oligo sets, respectively. Only target sequences
with full coverage of all three oligo-binding regions (forward primer, reverse primer, and

probe) are included in the analyses for both oligo sets. Partial target sequences and sequences
with ambiguous or degenerate bases in an oligo binding region are excluded from this
inclusivity analysis.
Based on in silico analysis of the percent homology between assay oligos and target
sequences, potential impact of location of the mismatches on extension and/or binding, and
the mismatch Tm values of each oligo sequence to its binding region on each SARS-CoV-2
sequence, it is predicted that the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct will detect all analyzed SARS-
CoV-2 sequences from the GISAID database, including sequences of the Omicron BA.1,
Omicron BA, Omicron BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants 2 and IHU variants.
An additional in silico inclusivity analysis was performed for complete SARS-CoV-2
genome sequences available in the GISAID database submitted from May 01, 2022 to July
31, 2022 including sequences of the Omicron BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, BA.4 and BA.5
subvariants. The analysis included 211,224 sequences in the amplicon regions of the ORF1ab
and S gene primer/probe regions. Only target sequences with full coverage of all three
ORF1ab and S gene forward and reverse primer as well as probe region were included in the
analyses. The analysis showed that the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct target regions had no
mismatch to 208,582 sequences (~98.7%) and were predicted to be detected by the assay
based on sequence homology. There were 2602 (~1.2%) sequences with no mismatches for
one gene oligo set (either ORF1ab or S gene), and there were 40 sequences (~0.02%) with
mismatches in at least one primer or probe binding region, region in either ORF1ab or S gene
target region.
A Tm analysis was conducted, and results are summarized below:

8. Assay Cut-Off:
Simplexa COVID-19 Direct test kit can be only used with LIAISON MDX System. It is a
thermocycler which is capable of heating, cooling, mixing of sample and reagents. The
system can detect up to four fluorophores at distinct wavelengths and the sensors on the
instrument can monitor the primary functions.
The assay cut-off for this device was established by adjusting the target fluorescent channel
threshold and the RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) cut-offs to values that allow for sensitivity
while maintaining analyte specificity. The fluorescent channel threshold was optimized with
the RT-PCR Ct cut-offs for the S gene (FAM), ORF1ab gene (JOE), and Internal Control
(Q670), during the Development, Verification and Transfer studies during the assay
development, according to the sponsor’s internal protocols. The MDX system is designed to
interpret the test data and automatically report the test results to the operator.
9. Carry-Over:
Since carry-over studies with high positive NPS samples followed by negative samples have
been previously performed for other FDA-cleared Simplexa assays, e.g., Simplexa Flu A/B
& RSV Direct Gen II (K201505), a carry-over study was not performed for this
submission.in support of the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay. The FDA-cleared Simplexa
Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II assay utilizes identical DAD discs to those used for the
Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay. For details on the carry-over study performed for the
cleared Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV Direct Gen II, please refer to file K201505

C Clinical Studies:
The clinical study for Simplexa COVID-19 Direct was conducted with prospective fresh and/or
prospective frozen NPS and/or NS specimens, collected from four geographically diverse
collection sites and four testing sites (three external clinical sites and one internal site). The
study utilized leftover, de-identified specimens prospectively collected in transport media
(Copan UTM, Cepheid UTM, BD VTM and saline 0.9%), between October 14, 2020, and April
30, 2021, from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection.
The performance of the assay was compared to the test results obtained with three commercially
available high-performing FDA EUA authorized SARS-CoV-2 molecular RT-PCR assays.
Specimens were collected from 1150 patients of which, 409 were NPS specimens and 741 were
NS specimens. All the patient samples were enrolled as all comers that met the study protocol
inclusion and exclusion criteria
Each specimen, after collection in the media, was tested with Simplexa COVID-19 Direct. For
comparison, the leftover samples were also tested with three comparator methods according to
the IFU for each of the assays, where the third assay was only used for samples which gave
discrepant results between the other two methods, for a two-out-of-three result interpretation.
There were 114 samples that were collected in media other than UTM or saline that were
excluded from analysis. Additionally, 139 specimens were excluded from the performance
analysis due to instrument failure (LIASON MDX) or user error (24), or an indeterminate
comparator result (1).
Among the 1011 specimens available for the final calculations of performance estimates, 443
(43.8%) were males ranging in age from 76 days old to 96 years old, and 568 (56.2%) were
females ranging in age from 51 days old to 91 years old.
The clinical performance of the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay when compared with the
comparator reference method (CRM) across the four sites combined is shown below.
