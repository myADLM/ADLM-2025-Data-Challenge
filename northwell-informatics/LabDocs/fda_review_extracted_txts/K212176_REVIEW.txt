Controls:
Positive and negative tissue controls that are fixed and processed in the same manner as the test
specimens should be used when performing this test. Positive and negative control tissue is used
to confirm that the assay performed as expected. For optimal quality control, cervical carcinoma
or CIN2/3 cervical tissue positive for CINtec Histology staining is suitable for use as a positive
tissue control, and normal cervical tissue is suitable for use as a negative tissue control. Normal
human tonsil tissue is also suitable for use as a tissue control, as tonsil contains both positive and
negative staining elements when stained with CINtec Histology. Within normal tonsil tissue,
there is nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining of scattered squamous epithelial cells primarily in
crypt epithelium and scattered follicular dendritic cells in germinal centers and absence of
staining in the majority of lymphocytes.
A negative reagent control mouse monoclonal antibody shall be used to evaluate nonspecific
staining. This negative reagent control should be used to stain an adjacent section of the patient
specimen tissue on a separate slide from the CINtec Histology slide. The staining protocol for the
negative reagent control antibody should be the same as that for the primary antibody.
B Principle of Operation:
CINtec Histology is an immunohistochemistry device used to stain FFPE cervical punch biopsy
tissue slides for the visualization of the p16INK4a protein. The test process involves the sequential
application of antibodies and a chromogen, with interposed washing steps. The assay
steps are as follows: 1) the anti-p16 antibody specifically binds to an epitope in the p16INK4a
protein; 2) a HQ-labeled secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody (HQ is a proprietary
hapten covalently linked to the secondary antibody); 3) a tertiary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
labeled antibody directed against HQ binds to the HQ-labeled secondary antibody; and 4) the
resulting complex is visualized with hydrogen peroxide and DAB, due to the formation of a
visible brown precipitate at the antigen site. The specimen slide is then counterstained with
hematoxylin and cover slipped. Results are interpreted using a light microscope by a pathologist.

Interpretation of Results
CINtec Histology is a qualitative test. The results are interpreted as either positive or negative
based on the p16 staining pattern in the FFPE cervical tissue section.
Positive Result: A positive result is defined as “diffuse” staining which is continuous staining of
cells in the basal and parabasal cell layers of the cervical squamous epithelium, with or without
staining of the intermediate or intermediate to superficial cell layers. Diffuse staining of any
intensity is considered to be positive for CINtec Histology status. In some specimens, nuclear
expression may be faint or undetectable, but nuclear p16 staining is not required to interpret the
CINtec Histology status. Cellular p16 staining for CINtec Hisology may be nuclear and/or
cytoplasmic.
Negative Result: A negative result is defined as either focal staining of the cervical epithelium or
absence of the p16 staining in the cervical epithelium. Focal staining is defined as staining of
isolated cells or small cell clusters, i.e., a non-continuous staining pattern, and particularly not in
the basal and parabasal cells.

C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
VENTANA BenchMark ULTRA instrument which fully automates the processes of baking,
deparaffinization, and staining. The BenchMark ULTRA instrument is composed of four
main modular components that work together as a system: 1) a stainer subassembly where all
slide processing operations are performed containing a reagent carousel, dispenser
mechanism, barcode readers, heating elements and other components; 2) an automated
fluidics subassembly that provides the compressed air and bulk fluids required by the stainer
subassembly; 3) a waste bottle subassembly that collects the waste generated by the system
during staining operations; and, 4) a personal computer (PC) running on a Microsoft
Windows platform that controls and monitors the system through the Ventana System
Software (VSS) host operating software.
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is performed through the VSS host operating software. Barcodes
reflecting the specific protocols for the CINtec Histology assay are printed by the user and
affixed to the appropriate patient specimen slides. Prior to starting the assay run, the
barcodes on the slides and dispensers are scanned and qualified by the host software to
ensure all elements are in place to complete the staining run. The specific automated staining
procedure is performed for each slide, based on the protocol associated to the key code from
the slide barcode.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Cervical punch biopsy specimens are collected by the clinician and placed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin. Tissue sections are prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) cervical punch biopsy specimens and mounted on glass slides. Slides are placed on
the VENTANA BenchMark ULTRA instrument for staining with the CINtec Histology
device.
4. Calibration:
Not applicable. See section titled Controls above.
5. Quality Control:
See Controls in section IV.A above.

VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:
The subject and predicate device (CINtec Histology) have special controls in the device-specific
classification regulation 21 CFR 864.1865. The special controls as outlined in the predicate
device De Novo Decision Summary (DEN160019) are unchanged except the results of the
performance testing that continues to meet current acceptance criteria. For a detailed description
of the performance testing, refer to Sections 13: Labeling and Section 18: Performance Testing
of this Traditional 510(k) Notification.
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A summary of performance testing is provided below. The subject recombinant CINtec
Histology performs equivalently to the predicate hybridoma CINtec Histology and both meet
current acceptance criteria.
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Between-Lot precision
Three production lots of the recombinant CINtec® Histology formulated with three independent
recombinant anti-p16 antibody raw material lots were used in this study to stain each of the 26
cervical tissue cases (6 No CIN, 6 CIN1, 6 CIN2, 6 CIN3, and 2 cervical squamous cell
carcinomas (SCC). These cases were qualified based on H&E staining. Eighteen sections were
cut from each tissue block. For each lot, duplicate slides from each case were stained with H&E,
CINtec® Histology and a Negative Control (Monoclonal). The H&E stained slides were adjacent
to the CINtec® Histology slides. All CINtec® Histology and Negative Control (Monoclonal)
stained slides were run on the same BenchMark ULTRA instrument. Appropriate control tissue
slides were also stained in each run.
Each CINtec® Histology stained slide was than paired with its adjacent H&E and Negative
Control (Monoclonal) slides. The order of the 26 slide sets was randomized. The sections stained
with recombinant CINtec® Histology were evaluated by a study pathologist for p16 staining
intensities (0-4), p16 staining pattern (diffuse, focal, negative) and background (acceptable,
unacceptable) and assigned a CINtec® Histology status (positive, negative) according to scoring
criteria described in the section titled “Interpretation of Results” above. Slide sets were also
assessed for histological diagnosis (No CIN, CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 or invasive carcinoma) based on
conjunctive evaluation of the H&E and recombinant CINtec® Histology stained slides and
assigned to CIN category (CIN2+ vs. CIN1-). Agreement across lots based on CINtec®
Histology status (positive/negative) and by CIN status categories (CIN1-/CIN2+) were
evaluated.
Acceptance Criteria: Stain intensity shall not vary more than 0.5 point from the median score on
a 0-4 scale of each sample on greater than or equal to 85% between lots; all samples shall show
equal to or higher than 90% positive/negative agreement for CINtec® Histology status; the

ii. Immunoreactivity
This study evaluated the immunoreactivity of recombinant CINtec Histology in various normal
[Tour of Body (TOB)] and malignant tissues [Tour of Tumor (TOT)]. Additionally, the study
evaluated if the positive and negative staining of these same tissue types with recombinant
CINtec Histology was consistent with the staining of hybridoma CINtec Histology.
Background/cross-reactivity and morphology was also evaluated. The sections from TOB and
TOT tissue microarrays and 20 additional individual cases were evaluated in this study. One
section from each array or case was stained with recombinant CINtec Histology and hybridoma
CINtec Histology and Negative Control (Monoclonal) on BenchMark ULTRA using OptiView
DAB IHC detection kit. Furthermore, sections from one prequalified tonsil case were stained
with hybridoma CINtec Histology and Negative Control (Monoclonal) were used as a run
control. The stained slides were evaluated by pathologist for staining intensities (0-4),
background and morphology (acceptable/ unacceptable).
Acceptance Criteria: Background/cross-reactivity less than or equal to 0.5 points on a 0-4 scale
in 90% or greater of the tissue samples stained. The recommended staining protocol shall
preserve tissue morphology as noted by the qualified reader in a minimum of 90% of
interpretable samples stained.

a. Western Blot
The primary objective of this study was to confirm the specificity of the recombinant anti-
p16INK4a antibody to bind p16INK4a protein. In addition, the results from the Western blot assay
using recombinant antibody were compared with the results using hybridoma Millipore anti-
p16INK4a (E6H4) antibody. The study also addressed the sensitivity of the recombinant anti-
p16INK4a antibody by evaluating the lysates from cell lines expressing various amounts of
p16INK4a protein.

One lot of recombinant anti-p16 antibody and one lot of hybridoma anti-p16 antibody were
evaluated. Lysates from four cell lines with various expression levels of p16INK4a protein and
purified recombinant p16INK4a protein (positive control) and recombinant GADPH protein
(negative control) were used in this study.
Acceptance Criteria: Single band between 15-20 kDa (~16 kDa) must be detected on the
Western blot membrane for those lanes loaded with recombinant p16INK4a protein or with lysates
from p16INK4a -expressing cell lines and consequently probed with recombinant anti- p16INK4a
antibody or hybridoma anti- p16INK4a antibody.
Both hybridoma and recombinant anti- p16INK4a (E6H4) antibody lots performed equivalently in
the Western Blot assay demonstrating same sensitivity and specificity for p16INK4a recombinant
and endogenous protein, with no significant unexpected off target reactivity observed.
b. Peptide Inhibition
®
The objective of this study is to confirm the specificity of CINtec Histology formulated with
the recombinant anti-p16 antibody for p16 protein in the context of the IHC assay.
One lot of the recombinant CINtec® Histology was used on a BenchMark ULTRA instrument
for this study. The anti-p16INK4a (E6H4) antibody was pre-incubated at 1:1 dilution with three
different concentrations (3x10-6 M, 3x10-7 M, and 3x10-8 M) of p16 INK4a epitope-specific
peptides (AGGTRGSNHARIDAAEGPSDIDP, MW=2265 g/mol). The non-specific peptide
used in this study is These three concentrations were selected to span a range of molar ratios:
approximately a 1000-fold, 100-fold, and 10-fold molar excess of peptide compared to the final
-9
concentration of anti-p16 antibody in the solution (3.3x10 M). The primary antibody was
also diluted 1:1 with three different concentrations (3x10-6 M, 3x10-7 M, and 3x10-8 M) of a
non-specific peptide control [Alk-a (amino acid sequence: CWQHQPEDRPNFAIILERIEY),
MW=2658 g/mol].
CINtec® Histology/no peptide control solution CINtec® Histology reagent was diluted at a 1:1
ratio with the diluent only. All these solutions contained only 50% of the CINtec® Histology
reagent. A multi-tissue block (MTB) containing one case of each CIN3, CIN1, and normal
cervical epithelium was used in this study.
Duplicate MTB slides were stained with these prepared solutions and also with undiluted
CINtec® Histology reagent. In addition, a single slide was stained with the negative reagent
control [Negative Control (Monoclonal)]. All stained slides were scored for p16 staining
intensity on a 0-4 scale for each tissue. Note: The p16 staining intensities determined for the
cervical tissues stained with CINtec® Histology/no peptide control solution were used as a
reference, since this solution contains the same amount of anti-p16 antibody as the solutions
containing p16- specific or non-specific peptides (50% only).
Acceptance Criteria: Decreased staining in the tissues stained with recombinant CINtec
Histology reagent containing p16 epitope-specific peptide when compared to the tissues stained
with recombinant CINtec Histology reagent containing diluent or non-specific peptide.
This study confirmed the specificity of recombinant anti-p16 (E6H4) antibody in the context of
the IHC assay. A nearly complete inhibition of the anti-p16 antibody binding to its target protein

in tissues was detected when the p16 specific peptide was present in the recombinant CINtec®
Histology reagent and partial restoration of specific staining was observed when the p16 specific
peptide concentration in recombinant CINtec® Histology reagent was reduced. In contrast, no
reduction in the signal intensities was observed when unrelated non-specific peptide was present
in recombinant CINtec® Histology reagent. No staining was detected when the tissues were
stained with Negative Control (Monoclonal) or diluent only.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the performance of the CINtec Histology
formulated with the recombinant anti-p16 antibody formulation and the CINtec Histology
formulated with the hybridoma anti-p16 antibody (predicate device). The study was conducted
using 249 cervical cases [114 No CIN, 17 CIN1, 53 CIN2, 51 CIN3, and 14 cervical SCC cases]
run on one BenchMark ULTRA instrument. The cases (H&E stained slides) were reviewed and
enrolled into the study by an experienced pathologist. Individual slides were stained with the
recombinant CINtec Histology and hybridoma CINtec Histology device, randomized and
evaluated for CINtec Histology status (positive/negative) by another pathologist (study
pathologist) who was not involved in the selection of study cases.
Acceptance Criteria: Overall percent agreement (OPA) shall demonstrate a lower
bound for the two-sided 95% confidence interval (LBCI) of greater than or equal to 85%.
Background should be (less than or equal to 0.5 points (on a 0-4 scale) in 90% or greater of the
tissue samples stained. Tissue morphology should be preserved as noted by the qualified reader
in a minimum of 90% of interpretable samples stained.
