specific IgE in human serum or plasma (EDTA or Na-Heparin). It is intended for in vitro
diagnostic use as an aid in the clinical diagnosis of IgE mediated allergic disorders in
conjunction with other clinical findings, and is to be used in clinical laboratories. ImmunoCAP
Specific IgE is to be used with the instrument Phadia 250, Phadia 1000, Phadia 2500 and Phadia
5000.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use on the instruments Phadia 250, Phadia 1000, Phadia 2500 and Phadia 5000
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ImmunoCAP system is a fully integrated and automated system for the determination of
specific IgE in human blood serum or plasma (EDTA or Na-Heparin) samples. It is comprised of
general, and test- and method-specific reagents for Phadia test system modules, as well as
instrument and data management software.
The general ImmunoCAP reagents include ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Conjugate, ImmunoCAP
Specific IgE Curve Control, ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Calibrators, Specific IgE anti-IgE
ImmunoCAP, Allergen ImmunoCAP carriers, ImmunoCAP development solution and stop
solution. The method-specific reagents consist of individual purified allergens (native or
recombinant) covalently coupled to a support in a plastic housing.
B Principle of Operation:
The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts with the specific
IgE in the patient sample. After washing away nonspecific IgE, enzyme-labeled antibodies
against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-IgE is washed
away and the bound complex is then incubated with a developing agent. After stopping the
reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more

specific IgE is present in the specimen. The fluorescence results are converted to ‘kU /L’
A
concentrations by the software with the use of a calibration curve.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
i) Within-laboratory imprecision:
Imprecision of each ImmunoCAP Allergen Component was evaluated by testing five
(f433, rTri a 14) or six (f416, rTri a 19 and f449, rSes i 1) positive samples (> 0.1 kU /L)
A
with concentrations of allergen-specific IgEs spanning the analytical measuring range
(AMR). Each sample was tested in four replicates in one assay run per day for a total of
20 operating days (yielding a total of 80 replicates per sample) except Sample 6 for f416,
rTri a 19, which was tested in three replicates in 11 runs over 20 days (yielding a total of
33 replicates). One lot of each ImmunoCAP Allergen Component was used for testing
each sample. The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE
Directions for Use using a Phadia 250 instrument. Mean concentrations of allergen-
specific IgEs, standard deviation (SD), and coefficients of variance (%CV) were
calculated for each sample separately. Results for all three ImmunoCAP Allergen
Components are shown in the table below:

ii) Lot-to-lot imprecision:
Three different lots of each ImmunoCAP Allergen Component were tested using four
(f433, rTri a 14 and f416, rTri a 19 ) or five (f449, rSes i 1) positive samples and one
negative sample (< 0.1 kU /L). For each lot, the samples were tested in 12 replicates in
A
one assay run. Each lot represented a different preparation of the allergen from routine
production. The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE,

2. Linearity:
The linearity of each ImmunoCAP Allergen Component was assessed following the CLSI
guideline I/LA-20 3rd Edition. Three (f449, rSes i 1) or four (f433, rTri a 14 and f416, rTri a
19) positive samples were each diluted in negative sample matrix to generate at least six 2-
fold consecutive dilutions. Samples were tested at a minimum of four replicates in one assay
run on the Phadia 250 instrument according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for
Use, using one lot of each ImmunoCAP Allergen component. Results of the replicates from
all samples were analyzed for linearity. Regression statistics comparing the observed results
to expected results are presented in the table below for each ImmunoCAP Allergen

Each inhibitor was added to positive samples at serial dilutions and the results from the
dose-dependent inhibition was conducted and analyzed as follows. Equal volumes of the
positive sample and varying serial dilutions of the three specific allergen components
were premixed. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at room temperature for 2
hours before being analyzed with each ImmunoCAP Allergen Component on the Phadia
250 instrument according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use. The
testing was performed in duplicate in one assay run. Mean values were calculated.
The inhibition test was evaluated with inhibition values in %, calculated according to the

inhibitors, including three from the unrelated group (rVes v 5, rFel d 2, and rOle e 1) and
one from the same group (rAra h 6), did not show any significant inhibition at 930
μg/mL. The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen f433, rTri a 14
LTP (Wheat) solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.
The f416, rTri a 19 Omega-5 Gliadin (Wheat) dose-dependent inhibition study using
inhibitor concentrations up to 450 μg/mL showed that >50% inhibition was achieved with
rTri a 19 at a final concentration of 30 µg/mL. The inhibition studies, using four
unrelated inhibitors, including three from the unrelated group (rCan f 4, rVes v 5, and
rAsp f 2) and one from the same group (rPru p 1), did not show any significant inhibition
at 4.5 mg/mL. The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen f416, rTri a
19 Omega-5 Gliadin (Wheat) solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.
The f449, rSes I 1 (Sesame seed) dose-dependent inhibition study using inhibitor
concentrations up to 166 μg/mL showed that >50% inhibition was achieved with the rSes
I 1 at a final concentration of 83 ng/mL. The inhibition studies, using four unrelated
inhibitors, including three from the unrelated group (rCan f 4, rAsp f 1, and rOle e 1) and
one from the same group (rCor a 8), did not show any significant inhibition at 1.66
mg/mL. The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen f449, rSes I 1
(Sesame seed) solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.
ii) Interference:
a) Endogenous Substance Interference:
Interferences by endogenous substances were assessed by testing two positive
samples and one negative sample following the CLSI guideline EP07, 3rd Edition.
Each sample was spiked with the interfering substances or substance-specific diluents
and analyzed in four replicates in one assay run using the Phadia 250 instrument
according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use. The data demonstrated
that ImmunoCAP Allergen Component: f433, rTri a 14 LTP (Wheat); f416, rTri a 19
Omega-5 Gliadin (Wheat); and f449, rSes I 1 (Sesame seed) were not adversely
affected (ln (sample spiked with interferents/sample spiked with blank solution < ±
0.1)) by high levels of the following substances tested up to the concentrations listed
in the table below:
Interferant No inhibition up to concentration tested
Bilirubin C 20.2 mg/dL
Bilirubin F 18.5 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 490 mg/dL
Chyle 1,630 FTU-Formazine Turbidity Units
Rheumatoid Factor 500 IU/mL
b) Exogenous Substance Interference:
Two literature references were provided to support the claim that commonly
prescribed allergy medications do not interfere with ImmunoCAP Specific IgE. The

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The claimed measuring range of each ImmunoCAP Allergen Components shown in the table
below.
ImmunoCAP Allergen Component Claimed assay range (kU /L)
A
f433, rTri a 14 LTP (Wheat) 0.10-100.00
f416, rTri a 19 Omega-5 Gliadin (Wheat) 0.10-68.44
f449, rSes i 1 (Sesame seed) 0.10-85.59
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
i) Traceability:
The IgE calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the 2nd
International Reference Preparation (IRP) 75/502 or the equivalent 3rd International
Standard 11/234 of Human Serum Immunoglobulin E from World Health Organization
(WHO).
ii) Kit Stability:
A real-time stability study was performed at 2–8°C to test two positive and one negative
sample using three lots of each ImmunoCAP Allergen Component in accordance with the
CLSI guideline EP25-A to demonstrate shelf-life stability. The real-time stability data
support unopened shelf-life stability of 19 months for f433, rTri a 14 LTP (Wheat) and
f416, rTri a 19 Omega-5 Gliadin (Wheat), and 6 months for f449, rSes i 1 (Sesame seed).
The real-time stability study for f449 is ongoing.
The studies to determine the stability of the calibration curve, real-time, and on-board
stability of ImmunoCAP IgE calibrator are described in K100999.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
determined on the Phadia 250 instrument according to the CLSI guideline EP17-A2 using
two lots of each ImmunoCAP Allergen Component.
K212181 - Page 10 of 13

[Table 1 on page 10]
	ImmunoCAP Allergen Component			Claimed assay range (kU /L)

f433, rTri a 14 LTP (Wheat)			0.10-100.00		
f416, rTri a 19 Omega-5 Gliadin (Wheat)			0.10-68.44		
f449, rSes i 1 (Sesame seed)			0.10-85.59		

--- Page 11 ---
The LoB was based on determinations of five blank samples in five replicates in one run per
day for three days (n=75 replicates) for each lot and was estimated as the 95% percentile of
the distribution. Results from maximum LoB of the two lots were used in the calculation of
LoB.
LoD was calculated according to the equation: LoD = LoB + cß • SD , where SD is the
LoD LoD
pooled SD for each of five low positive samples using two lots measured in five replicates in
three runs (n=15 replicates) for each lot. LoQ was determined and calculated at 20% CV of
the test results from LoD study.
The results from the higher LoB, LoD and LoQ of the two lots are presented in the table
below.
ImmunoCAP Allergen Component LoB LoD LoQ
(kU /L) (kU /L) (kU /L)
A A A
f433, rTri a 14 LTP (Wheat) 0.014 0.019 0.058

f449, rSes i 1 (Sesame seed) 0.000 0.014 0.041
The precision profile provided supports the claimed LoQ of 0.1 kUA/L at ≤20% CV.
