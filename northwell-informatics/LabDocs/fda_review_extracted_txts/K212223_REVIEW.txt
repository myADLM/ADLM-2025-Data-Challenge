III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Atellica® CH Enzymatic Creatinine_3 (ECre3) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the
quantitative determine of creatinine in human serum, plasma (lithium heparin and dipotassium
EDTA), and urine using the Atellica® CH Analyzer. Such measurements are used in the
diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases and in monitoring renal dialysis.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Atellica® CH Analyzer/Trinidad CH System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Atellica® CH Enzymatic Creatinine_3 (ECre3) assay reagents are packaged in 2 packs with
2 wells per pack. The wells have a divider which keeps the two liquid chambers separate. In pack
1 (P1) and pack 2 (P2) both wells are used.
Atellica® CH ECre3 Pack 1 (P1) consist of 23.5 mL of Creatinase (<133,350 U/L); sarcosine
oxidase(<39,000 U/L); N-ethyl-N-(3-methylphenyl)-N’-succinyl-ethylenediamine
(EMSE)(0.04%); detergent; preservatives, bovine serum albumin (0.1%), bovine catalase.
Atellica®CH ECre3 Pack 2 (P2) consist of 11.5 mL of Peroxidase; creatininase(<600,000 U/L);
4-aminoantipyrine (4‑AA) (0.001%); detergent; sodium azide (< 0.1%); preservatives.
B Principle of Operation:
This assay uses a creatinine enzymatic method that measures the concentration of creatinine
through a series of coupled enzymatic reactions. A “pretreatment” reaction removes endogenous
creatine and sarcosine using creatinase and sarcosine oxidase. First, creatinine is enzymatically
converted by creatininase into creatine. Creatine is then enzymatically converted to sarcosine by
creatinase. This is followed by the oxidation of sarcosine by sarcosine oxidase to produce
hydrogen peroxide. In the presence of peroxidase, the hydrogen peroxide allows for the
oxidative condensation of 4-aminoantipyrine and N-ethyl-N-(3-methylphenyl)-N’-
succinylethylenediamine to produce a reddish purple quinone pigment. The absorbance of this
quinone pigment is measured as an endpoint reaction at 545/694 nm.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Eleven (11) samples comprised of 8 serum and 3 urine sample pools were aliquoted and
frozen prior to the start of the study. Testing was performed with three (3) Atellica® CH
ECre3 reagent lots on one (1) Atellica® CH Analyzer. For each testing day, new serum and
urine pool aliquots were thawed and assayed. Each sample was assayed in two (2)
replicates per run, with two (2) runs per day separated by a minimum of 2 hours between
runs, for 20 days, yielding a total 80 replicates. Reproducibility was determined in
accordance with CLSI EP05‑A3 guideline. Samples were assayed n=5 in 1 run for 5 days
using 3 instruments and 3 reagent lots. The data were analyzed to calculate the following
components of precision: repeatability, between-day, between-lot, between-instrument, and
reproducibility (total). The following results were obtained:

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP6-A
guideline.
Native human serum and native human urine samples were spiked to create the high samples.
Native human serum and native human urine were diluted with Atellica® CH Diluent to
create the low samples. A set of 8 equally spaced creatinine sample levels were prepared by
mixing a low serum/urine sample with a high serum/urine sample.
The expected creatinine concentration levels used in the study for serum: 0.01, 3.93, 7.84,
11.75, 15.66, 19.58, 23.49, 27.40, and 31.31 mg/dL and for urine: 0.28, 32.34, 64.48, 96.58,
128.68, 160.78, 192.88, 224.98, and 257.07 mg/dL. Measurements were made with 4
replicates per level. The results showed that the deviation from linearity did not exceed 5%.
The results of the regression analysis are summarized below:
Analyte Sample Type Linear Regression
Serum y=0.99x+ 0.02 mg/dL
Creatinine
Urine y=0.98x + 0.05 mg/dL
The results from the linearity study support an analytical measuring range of 0.15 to 30.00
mg/dL for serum/plasma and 2.00 to 245.00 mg/dL for urine.

Dilution:
The sponsor provided data to support that automatic dilution can be used to assay samples
containing creatinine concentrations above the claimed analytical measuring interval. The
results of the dilution study showed that 5-fold dilution could be used to measure samples
within an extended measuring interval up to 150.00 mg/dL for the serum/plasma sample type
and up to 1225.00 mg/dL for the urine sample type using the automated dilution routine on
the Atellica® Chemistry Analyzer.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The interference study was performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP07-3rd
edition guideline.
Various concentrations of interferents were spiked into pooled human serum or pooled
human urine containing creatinine at normal (1 mg/dL) and high (8 mg/dL) concentrations.
Human serum pools were split into control and test pools. The test pools were spiked with
the interferents and the control pools were spiked with an equivalent volume of diluent. Low
level analyte serum pool was native serum and the high-level analyte serum pool was
prepared using a concentrated creatinine spiking solution. Five (5) replicates were tested per
sample. Nonsignificant interference was defined by the sponsor as the highest interferent
level tested with ≤10% bias of the control for both serum and urine samples.

6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
For the LoB determination of serum and urine, 4 blank samples were tested with n=5
replicates per sample using 3 Atellica® CH ECre3 reagent lots for 3 days on 1 Atellica CH
Analyzer for a total of 60 measurements per reagent lot. The LoB was calculated non-
parametrically as the 95th percentile ranked position of all blank samples.
The LoD was determined parametrically using the pooled standard deviation of the highest
observed LoB and results from 4 low analyte serum and urine samples prepared by diluting
native serum and urine samples with Atellica® CH Diluent and tested in n=5 replicates per
sample using 3 Atellica® CH ECre3 reagent lots for 3 days on 1 Atellica® CH Analyzer for
a total of 60 measurements per reagent lot.
A LoQ study was performed using 4 low concentration serum pools and 2 reagent lots. Each
sample was assayed in n=5 replicates per sample on 3 Atellica® CH ECre3 reagent lots for 3
days, on 1 Atellica® CH Analyzer for a total of 60 measurements per lot for serum and urine,
respectively. The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration of creatinine at which the
total analytical error is ≤ 0.10 mg/dL for serum and plasma and ≤ 1.50 mg/dL for urine. The
results are summarized in the table below:

tested on one Atellica® CH Analyzer and the predicate method ADVIA Chemistry ECRE_2
tested on one ADVIA 1800 Chemistry system. Only the first replicate was used for analysis.

2. Matrix Comparison:
Fifty-five (55) matched samples (serum, lithium heparin plasma, and K2-EDTA plasma)
were evaluated in duplicate with 1 lot of the Atellica® CH ECre3 reagent. Five (5) of the
samples were spiked to obtain higher creatinine concentrations. Only the first replicate was
used in analysis.
Deming regression results are as follows:

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that lithium heparin and K2-EDTA
plasma are acceptable sample types for the candidate device.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Expected Values
Transference as defined in CLSI EP28-A3c was used to verify established reference ranges for
serum and plasma creatinine. Healthy male and female serum, lithium heparin plasma, and
dipotassium EDTA plasma samples were obtained (23 men and 21 women) and processed with
N=2 replicates, only the first replicate was used in analysis. Results of the verification study
support the serum reference ranges which were established through literature.
Group Sample Type Reference Interval
Males Serum/Plasmaa 0.73-1.18 mg/dL
Females Serum/Plasmaa 0.55-1.02 mg/dL
Males Urineb 800-2000 mg/day
Females Urineb 600-1800 mg/day
