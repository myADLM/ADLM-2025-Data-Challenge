D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using 9.04 software
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GP Telavancin has the following concentrations of Telavancin in the card: 0.015,
0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL).
The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 AST-GP Telavancin is ≤0.015 to ≥1 µg/mL. For all
species, the MIC result range indicates that the VITEK 2 system is capable of producing the
following MIC results: ≤0.015, 0.03, 0.06, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and ≥1 µg/mL for the AST-Gram
Positive Telavancin test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Telavancin was conducted at
three sites (two external and one internal site) using a panel of ten Gram positive organisms
consistent with the indications for use (i.e., five isolates of S. aureus and five isolates of E.
faecalis). Each isolate was tested in triplicate, using separate inocula, over three days for a
total of 270 data points. Inocula were prepared using both the autodilution and manual
dilution methods for testing with the VITEK 2 System. In addition, inocula were prepared by
the manual dilution method for testing with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode of MIC values
was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was calculated based on the number
of MIC values that fell within ± 1 doubling dilution of the mode.
All MIC results were on-scale and within one doubling dilution from the modal MIC value;
therefore, only best-case results are reported. The testing resulted in an overall
reproducibility of 100% (270/270) when testing with the VITEK 2 System (autodilution and
manual dilution methods) and the VITEK 2 Compact System (manual dilution method).

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The CLSI recommended QC strains for telavancin, E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus
ATCC 29213, were tested a sufficient number of time (i.e., at least 20 times/site) at each
testing site using both the VITEK 2 card and broth microdilution reference methods. Both the

automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual
dilution method was used for VITEK 2 Compact.
Results obtained using the autodilution and the manual dilution methods for VITEK2 and the
manual dilution for VITEK 2 Compact QC results are summarized in Table 1 below. Greater
than 95% of the results were within the expected range although trending toward higher MIC
values was observed for E. faecalis ATCC 29212; QC was determined to be acceptable.

Inoculum Density Check: The DensiCheck Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a
0.5 McFarland standard. The instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at
each site. Calibration values were within the expected range.
Device Failure: During the performance of the comparative study, there were several
instrument processing errors that resulted in loss of AST cards vith the VITEK 2 System. All
isolates affected by these errors were retested in accordance with the testing protocol. There
were no device failures with the VITEK 2 Compact.
Growth Failure Rate: One clinical isolate of S. aureus failed to grow in the VITEK 2 Cards
(autodilution). There were no growth failures with VITEK 2 manual dilution or with VITEK
2 Compact.
Purity Check: Purity plates were prepared from the inoculum suspensions. AST results were
only reported for pure isolates.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Testing of telavancin was performed at three external sites and one internal site. Results
obtained with VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Telavancin were compared to results obtained
with the CLSI broth microdilution reference panel. The MIC result range for the VITEK 2
AST-Gram Positive Telavancin is ≤0.015 to ≥1 µg/mL for all species. The testing conditions
for the reference method consisted of the following:
• Medium: Cation Adjusted Mueller Hinton broth supplemented with 0.002%
polysorbate 80
• Inoculum: 1 mL of organism suspension standardized to approximate a McFarland
0.5 standard
• Incubation: 35 ± 2°C; 16-20 hours
The VITEK 2 cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test
inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using
the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 771 clinical isolates belonging to all genera were evaluated using autodilution and
VITEK 2. Of these isolates, 25% were fresh isolates (tested within seven days from
isolation), 25% were recent isolates (tested within one year from isolation) and 50% were
stock isolates (no specific time from isolation). The clinical isolates included: 301 isolates of
vancomycin susceptible E. faecalis and 470 isolates of S. aureus (including 161 isolates of
MSSA and 309 isolates of MRSA).
A total of 117 challenge isolates were evaluated, including 67 isolates of vancomycin
susceptible E. faecalis and 50 isolates of S. aureus (20 isolates of MSSA and 30 isolates of
MRSA).
Clinical and Challenge Data –VITEK 2 Autodilution
The results obtained using the autodilution method of the VITEK 2 from the 888 total
isolates (771 clinical isolates and 117 challenge isolates) are summarized in Table 2.

EA – Essential Agreement min – minor errors

Essential agreement (EA) occurs when the result of the reference method and that of the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive
Telavancin are within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on-
scale for both the reference method and the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Telavancin or results in which an off scale
result is at least two doubling dilutions from the on scale result. Category agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation
of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation provided by the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive
Telavancin.
For S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA combined) evaluated using VITEK 2 and autodilution, the
overall EA and CA were acceptable at 94.2% and 98.9%, respectively (Table 2), with six
susceptible isolates providing non-susceptible results (major errors). For MSSA, the EA and
CA were 95.6% and 99.5%, respectively, with one major error; for MRSA, the EA and CA
were 93.5% and 98.5%, respectively with five major errors. The results for S. aureus were
acceptable.
For vancomycin susceptible E. faecalis evaluated using VITEK 2 and autodilution, the
overall EA and CA were acceptable at 89.9% and 92.9%, respectively (Table 2). Of the 367
susceptible isolates, 26 (7.1%) provided non-susceptible MICs (major errors). All of the
major errors occurred with clinical isolates. Five of the major errors were within essential
agreement with the reference method; due to the lack of an intermediate breakpoint, these
five major errors were considered acceptable, and the major error rate was adjusted to 5.7%
which is still higher than the acceptable rate of major errors. To address the major errors
observed with E. faecalis, the following limitation was included in the device labeling:
Due to the occurrence of major errors, perform an alternative method of testing prior to
reporting of non-susceptible results for the following antibiotic/organism combination:
• [tlv04n] Telavancin: Enterococcus faecalis
To provide clarity on the calculation of the adjusted major error rate, the following footnote
was added to the performance table in th device labeling:
Five major errors for Enterococcus faecalis were within essential agreement with the
reference method; due to the lack of an intermediate breakpoint these five major errors
were considered acceptable and the major error rate is adjusted to 5.7% which will still
require retesting of non-susceptible strains with an alternate method.
Challenge Data –VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Manual Dilution
The 117 challenge isolates were also evaluated with the manual dilution options of the
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems (summarized in Table 3).

The overall performance of VITEK 2 when using the manual dilution method with E.
faecalis challenge isolates was acceptable with an EA of 98.5%, a CA of 100%, and zero
major or very major errors. The overall performance of VITEK 2 when using the manual
dilution method with S. aureus challenge isolates was also acceptable with an EA of 98.0%, a
CA of 100%, and zero major or very major errors.
The overall performance of VITEK 2 Compact with E. faecalis challenge isolates showed an
EA of 95.5%, a CA of 97.0%, and zero (0) very major errors. Of the 66 susceptible isolates,
two (3.0%) provided non-susceptible MICs (major errors), which is not acceptable, as
described and addressed in the limitation statement above. The overall performance of
VITEK 2 Compact with S. aureus challenge isolates was acceptable with an EA of 100%, a
CA of 100%, and zero major or very major errors.
No non-susceptible isolates of S. aureus were evaluated in the comparative study and only a
single non-susceptible isolate of E. faecalis was tested. To address the lack of information
regarding performance with non-susceptible strains, the following limitation was added to the
device labeling:
The ability of the AST card to detect non-susceptible strains with the following
combination(s) is unknown because an insufficient number of non-susceptible strains
were available at the time of comparative testing:
• [ tlv04n] Telavancin: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis
In addition to evaluating results obtained with S. aureus and E. faecalis, 55 isolates of S.
agalactiae were tested with the autodilution method and 27 isolates of S. agalactiae were
tested with the manual dilution method. However, performance of telavancin with this
species was not acceptable with either the VITEK 2 or VITEK 2 Compact. The following
limitation was added to the device labeling:
Perform an alternative method of testing prior to reporting of results for the following
antibiotic/organism combination(s):
• [tlv04n]: Telavancin: Streptococcus agalactiae
As required under 511A(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the
following statement is included in the Precautions section of the device labeling to address
testing and reporting of non-indicated species:

Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.
Trending
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the VITEK 2 autodilution method for each species. This trending calculation analyzes
device MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher
than the reference method. MIC values that are off-scale for both the reference and device are
not considered in the trending analysis. Species for which the difference between the
percentage of isolates with higher or lower MIC values was ≥ 30% with a statistically
significant confidence interval were considered to have evidence of trending and is addressed
in the labeling.

A trend toward higher MIC values was observed for E. faecalis and S. aureus (Table 4). To
address the observed trending, the following footnote was added to the performance table in
the device labeling:
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Telavancin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or
at least one doubling dilution higher when testing E. faecalis and S. aureus compared to
the CLSI reference broth microdilution method.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GP Telavancin when revised breakpoints for
telavancin are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the
telavancin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
