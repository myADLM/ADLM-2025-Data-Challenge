IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Novo is a web-based software-only device that is intended to aid pathology professionals in the
viewing, interpretation, and management of digital whole slide images (WSIs) of scanned
surgical pathology slides prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue using
the Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS) Ultra Fast Scanner (UFS). Novo functionalities
include image upload, image management, image conversion and viewing WSIs.
Novo is operated as follows:
1. The user prepares and scans slides and reviews the slide quality in accordance with the PIPS
UFS indication for use (IFU) and any other laboratory specific procedures.
2. The user uploads WSIs to cloud storage using Novo and builds a patient accession using the
patient’s medical record number (MRN), date of birth (DOB) and accession ID to support
linkage of one or more slides from a single procedure using patient identifiers in Novo.
3. Once slide image is acquired using PIPS UFS according to its IFU and becomes available in
scanner database file systems, Novo will automatically initiate uploading the slide image
(using Novo uploader) and corresponding metadata to persistent cloud storage. Integrity
checks are performed at upload time when data is copied to storage. During review, the
pathologist opens WSI images from storage [displayed as Deep Zoom Image (DZI) images]
using Novo , performs further QC and reads WSI images of the slides to make a primary
diagnosis. The workflow of a pathologist includes zooming and panning images.
After viewing all images belonging to a particular accession, the pathologist renders a diagnosis.

C. Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Not applicable – software only device
2. Specimen Identification:
Novo uses digital pathology images obtained from the PIPS UFS of Hematoxylin and Eosin
(H&E) stained glass slides. The reading pathologist selects a case (patient) from a worklist
external to the subject device whereby the subject device fetches the associated images from
the external image storage. The scanned images are identified based on the previously
assigned specimen identifier.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling and handling are performed upstream and independent of the use of the
subject device. Specimen sampling includes biopsy or resection specimens which are
processed using histology techniques. The FFPE tissue section is H&E stained. Digital
images are them obtained from these glass slides using the PIPS UFS.

5. Quality Control:
Before reading pathology images using the Novo device, the pathologist should ensure that
all scanned slide images have been imported and for every case, view the thumbnails in the
pathology image window to verify that each slide that should be in the case is present
(manually verifying tissue block and staining information from LIS).

B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Technical performance testing for Novo device was performed. The new device was compared to
the image management software component of the predicate device. The following testing was
performed:
a. Bench Testing – Pixel-wise comparison test
A pixel-wise comparison test was performed to compare images reproduced by Novo and PIPS
IMS for the same iSyntax file to demonstrate identical image reproduction. Thirty H&E-stained
FFPE glass slides from various organs and tissue types were used in this test. The slides were
scanned with the PIPS UFS, and each slide image was read by a qualified pathologist to choose
three regions of interest (ROIs) that included relevant, biologically representative anatomical
features. Each ROI was selected with the relevant features placed at the center at magnification
levels 20x and 40x. A total of 180 ROIs were made available for both PIPS IMS and Novo to
display on the screen using the default settings.
Cypress, a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework, was used to capture the screenshots.
The Cypress built-in screenshot functionality captured the image sized 1458 pixels by 897 pixels
by specifying the HTML canvas element that was displayed. The captured screenshots were then
aligned and converted to RGB pixel data using the python imaging library Pillow.
The RGB pixel data was bound to the sRGB color space and converted to the CIELAB color
space. The color difference of each corresponding pixel-pair was calculated using the
CIEDE2000 (ΔE ) formula for further analysis.
00
For each ROI, the ΔE histogram was calculated as well as its cumulative distribution function,
00
which allows for observation of many statistical results such as maximum ΔE , minimum ΔE ,
00 00
99-percentile, 4-ΔE , area-over-the-curve, etc.
00
Test results show that the color differences (ΔE00) between Novo and PIPS/IMS are not zero.
Test results are shown in Table 3 below.

Further, testing was conducted to compare Novo-generated images with JPEG-compressed
PIPS/IMS-generated images. Test results show that the Novo-generated images are similar to
PIPS/IMS-generated images that had been JPEG-compressed at quality 95.
Based on the findings from bench testing, an additional clinical study was performed to establish
the safety and effectiveness of the device.
b. Clinical Study
A clinical study was conducted to demonstrate that viewing, reviewing, and diagnosing WSIs of
H&E stained FFPE tissue slides using Novo [manual digital read (MD)] is non-inferior to glass
slide reads using optical (light) microscopy [manual optical (MO)]. The primary endpoint of the
study was the difference in major discordance rates between MD and MO when compared to the
reference (main) diagnosis, which was the original sign-out pathologic diagnosis using MO
[ground truth, (GT)] rendered at the institution.
This study included 264 cases which were representative of the breadth and range of organs,
sample types and diagnosis including challenging diagnoses in histopathology. Study cases
included one representative H&E slide per case. Slides were scanned using the FDA cleared
Philips UFS at 40x magnification at one site and reviewed by the study pathologists at their
individual sites using the Novo device and a Barco PP27QHD monitor, as specified by Phillips
UFS and Novo IFU. Images were checked for image quality according to scanner instructions
before upload to the platform.
Three (3) pathologists read all cases which were deidentified, using MD and MO with a washout
of two (2) weeks in between the MD and MO. All 3 reading pathologists read the slides for all
cases at their individual sites using both MD and MO. The reading pathologists were provided
with 3 batches of slides. A case report form (CRF) was completed to document the reading
pathologist’s diagnosis for each batch, and each read (MD and MO). Reads from both modalities
(MD or MO) were adjudicated by one independent pathologist who was not part of the study to
determine agreement with the GT and to each other, using standardized pre-defined definitions
of harm as follows: 1) concordant, 2) major discordant or 3) minor discordant.
The primary endpoint was to demonstrate that the proportion of major discordances between
diagnosis based on MD and GT diagnosis is no worse than 0.04 above the proportion of major
discordances between diagnosis based on MO and GT. The secondary endpoint was to show the
observed proportion of concordances between diagnosis based on glass slides and WSI is at least
95%.

Of the 264 cases, one slide was not available for scanning due to breakage and was excluded
from both primary and secondary analysis; a second slide was marked as “adjudication not
available” and was excluded from primary analysis; a third slide was excluded from both
analysis since the slide ID was not confirmed by one of the pathologists. Therefore, the primary
analysis included 261 cases and the secondary analysis included 262 cases.
The differences in major discordance rates between MD and GT compared to MO and GT were -
0.1% (95% CI, -2.05, 1.78) for all organs as shown in Table 4 below. The upper limit of the CI
for the major discordance rate was 1.78%, which is less than the prespecified noninferiority
threshold of 4%, therefore meeting the primary objective of the study.

MD vs GT (131/783) 16.7 (12.86, 20.64)
Difference -0.1 (-2.05, 1.78)
Secondary analysis (Table 5 below) showed the observed proportion of concordances between
diagnosis based on MO and MD was 95.7%, which surpasses the secondary objective of
concordance between MO and MD of at least 95%.

Overall, these results demonstrate that the PathAI Novo image viewer is safe and effective when
used by pathologists for primary diagnoses purposes.
c. Turnaround Time for the image to be fully loaded while opening a slide for
panning/zooming
Turnaround time (TAT) testing was performed for WSI file processing and DZI loading,
panning, and zooming in the subject device. The subject device demonstrated acceptable
turnaround time with respect to its intended use for opening the first image and panning and
zooming within the image.
d. Human Factors testing
