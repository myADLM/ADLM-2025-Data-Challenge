III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
N Latex FLC kappa and lambda are in-vitro diagnostic reagents for the quantitative
determination of free light chains (FLC), type kappa or type lambda in human serum and EDTA-
plasma. N Latex FLC kappa and lambda assays are used:
• as an aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma (MM) on the BN Systems
and Atellica CH Analyzer.
• as an aid in the diagnosis of immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis (AL) on the BN
Systems and Atellica CH Analyzer.
• as an aid in the monitoring of immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis (AL) on the BN
Systems.
• as an aid in the evaluation of Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance
(MGUS) on the BN Systems and Atellica CH Analyzer.
Results of FLC measurements should always be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory
and clinical findings.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Warning: The result of the FLC kappa or FLC lambda in a given specimen determined with
assays and/or instrument platforms from different manufacturers can vary due to differences in
assay methods and reagent specificity. The results reported by the laboratory to the physician
must include the identity of the FLC kappa or FLC lambda assay used. Values obtained with
different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably. The values of FLC kappa or FLC
lambda on BN systems and on Atellica CH Analyzer should not be used interchangeably. If, in
the course of serially monitoring a patient, the assay method used for determining the FLC kappa
and FLC lambda levels is changed, additional sequential testing should be carried out. Prior to
changing assays, the laboratory MUST confirm baseline values for patients being serially
monitored.
Precautions
• The performance of N Latex FLC kappa and lambda has not been thoroughly studied in IgM
and Light Chain MGUS patients due to the low prevalence of these subtypes.
• Patients with decreased renal function (e.g. chronic kidney disease) may have elevated FLC
kappa and FLC lambda.
• Sample populations excluded MGUS populations that were further diagnosed with a disease/
disorder in subsequent testing with another medical device such as human immunodeficiency
K212379 - Page 2 of 9

virus, hepatitis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Thus, because the samples were enriched
the specificity of the test may be inflated.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Atellica CH Analyzer (K151767)
BN II System (K943997)
BN ProSpec (K001647)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
No modification is made to the kit components for the N Latex FLC Kappa and N Latex FLC
Lambda cleared in K171742, K182098, K193047, and K201496. The assays are comprised of
the following reagents in liquid form:
• N latex FLC reagents: consist of suspension of polystyrene particles coated with
monoclonal antibodies (mouse) to either human FLC Kappa or human FLC Lambda with
preservative.
• N FLC Supplementary Reagents A and B: N FLC Supplementary Reagent A contains
mouse immunoglobulin in buffered solution with preservative, and N FLC Supplementary
Reagent B consists of a buffered salt solution containing detergent with preservative.
• N FLC Standard SL: contains human free light chains proteins, human serum albumin and
protease inhibitors.
• N FLC Controls SL1 and SL2: contains human free light chain proteins, human serum
albumin and protease inhibitors.
B Principle of Operation:
The N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda assays on the Atellica CH Analyzer are based
upon the principles of particle-enhanced turbidimetry. Polystyrene particles coated with
antibodies to human free light chains, type kappa or lambda, respectively, are agglutinated when
mixed with samples containing free light chain. Monitoring the agglutination by measuring the
increase in turbidity, a concentration curve is obtained. The actual change in absorbance is
proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated
by comparison with a standard of known concentration.

2. Linearity:
See K171742 for linearity of the N Latex FLC kappa and lambda assays on BN systems.
A linearity study was conducted according to CLSI EP06-A to determine the linear AMR of
N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda assay on the Atellica CH Analyzer. At least
nine different dilutions covering the entire AMR were prepared and measured in at least four
replicates using one reagent lot, one standard lot and one control lot. For each sample
concentration, the arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and the deviation between the linear
regression model and the best fitting polynomial regression model was calculated. The
results support the AMR claimed for N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda on the
Atellica CH Analyzer: 3.91 to 60.00 mg/L for N Latex FLC kappa; 5.47 to 70.00 mg/L for
N Latex FLC lambda.
Hook effect:
See K171742 for high dose hook effect of the N Latex FLC kappa and lambda assays on BN
systems.
The hook effect of the N Latex FLC Kappa and N Latex FLC Lambda assays on the Atellica
CH Analyzer was evaluated. No high dose hook effect was observed up to an analyte
concentration of 30 000 mg/L for both assays.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
See K171742 for interference of the N Latex FLC kappa and lambda assays on BN systems.
The N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda assays were evaluated for interference on
the Atellica CH Analyzer according to CLSI Guideline EP07-A2 . For each assay, no
interference was observed up to the indicated concentration for the tested endogenous
substances shown in the following table

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The analytical measuring range (AMR) for N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda on
the Atellica CH Analyzer is: 3.91 to 60.00 mg/L for N Latex FLC kappa and 5.47 to 70.00
for N Latex FLC lambda.
If samples are above the AMR, the system automatically dilutes the initial sample aliquot
1:10 allowing to extend the measuring range up to 600.00 mg/L for N Latex FLC kappa and
700.00 mg/L for N Latex FLC lambda.
If samples are below the AMR, the samples can be re-measured automatically in a 1:1.5
dilution. However, it must be noted that values reported below the AMR are not fully
validated.
5. Detection Limit:
See K171742 for detection limit on BN system
The same studies were performed on Atellica CH analyzer. The following results are
provided in Alliance Application sheet for Atellica analyzer:
a. Limit of Blank (LoB)
All results measured on blank samples for the LoB study yielded results below the
respective LoQ of each assay.
b. Limit of Detection (LoD)
LoD is greater than LoB and equal or below LoQ.
c. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
LoQ for N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex FLC lambda was determined on the Atellica
CH Analyzer according to CLSI guideline EP17-A2. The LoQ is the lowest
concentration of analyte with the total error below 19.10% and shown as follows:
N Latex FLC kappa: 1.037 mg/L
N Latex FLC lambda: 1.661 mg/L

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
To demonstrate the equivalent performance of the N Latex FLC kappa and lambda assays on
the BN system and Atellica CH analyzer as an aid in evaluation of MGUS, the method
comparison study was conducted internally at the Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products
GmbH site in Marburg, Germany according to CLSI EP09c. Samples derived from MGUS
patients (38 for kappa and 35 for lambda) were tested using N Latex FLC kappa and N Latex
FLC lambda assays on the Atellica CH Analyzer and the BN ProSpec System. Passing-
Bablok regression analysis was performed for each assay and the results are shown in the
following table:
Sample Range Slope Y-Intercept Correlation
N
(mg/L) (95% CI ) (95% CI) Coefficient
N Latex FLC 0.97 0.645
38 6.61–345 0.977
Kappa (0.93–1.00) (-0.21–1.19)
N Latex FLC 0.84 0.123
35 8.52–181 0.970
Lambda (0.75–0.93) (-1.69–2.69)
As the slope of method comparison for FLC lambda on the Atellica CH Analyzer and the BN
system is 0.84, the bias was analyzed for the samples around the lower and higher reference
interval. The results are shown in the table below:
Lower Limit of Upper Limit of
Predicted Predicted
Reference Interval Reference Interval
Bias (%) Bias (%)
(mg/L) (mg/L)
N Latex FLC
9.10 -15.7 32.6 -16.9
Lambda
Because of the observed difference of the result of N Latex FLC lambda on the Atellica CH
analyze and BN system, when this assay is used to evaluate the MGUS patients, a warning
statement “The values of FLC kappa or FLC lambda on BN systems and on Atellica® CH
Analyzer should not be used interchangeably” is included in the package insert.
Additionally, to mitigate the exceptionally high negative bias observed for FLC lambda
determination when tested on the Atellica CH analyzer, the following limitation is added in
the Alliance Application sheet for the assays used on the Atellica CH Analyzer:
“There was >15% negative bias observed for FLC Lambda on Atellica CH analyzer when
comparing with BN system for evaluation of MGUS samples. For Non-IgM MGUS and IgM
MGUS, physician should consider results of FLC kappa and lambda test as ancillary and
make diagnosis based on the totality of the data”.
C Clinical Studies:
See K193047 for the clinical studies conducted for evaluation of MGUS using the BN system.
