III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The hCG One Step Pregnancy Test is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative determination
of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone in human urine samples. It is used as an aid in early
detection of pregnancy, in some cases as early as five (5) days before the expected period, i.e., as
early as six (6) days before the day of the missed period.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The hCG One Step Pregnancy Test is a qualitative immunochromatographic assay containing a
lateral flow test strip housed in a cassette. The test strip can be used in midstream and dip mode.
B Principle of Operation:
The hCG One Step Pregnancy Test is a lateral flow sandwich immunochromatographic assay
that utilizes a combination of monoclonal antibodies for qualitative detection of hCG in human
urine samples. The test uses two lines to show the results. When the urine sample is added to the
absorbent tip, the sample migrates via capillary action along the membrane. If present in the
sample, hCG will react with the specific monoclonal hCG antibody and form a colored line at the
test line region of the membrane, indicating a positive result (pregnant). Absence of a colored
line at the test line region suggests a negative result (not pregnant). To serve as a procedural
control, a colored line will always appear in the control line region. If the control line does not
appear (no color appears at the control line region 3 minutes after application of the sample), the
test is invalid and the specimen should be retested with a new device.

Cross Reactivity Study:
The hCG One Step Pregnancy Test was evaluated for potential cross-reactivity from
luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH). Urine specimens from non-pregnant females were used to prepare samples
with hCG levels at 0 and 10 mIU/mL hCG and were spiked with the potential cross-reactants
to obtain the desired test concentration. The results demonstrated no cross-reactivity from
potential cross-reactants up to 800 mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH, and 1 mIU/mL TSH in
either negative or positive urine samples.
Effect of urine pH and Specific Gravity:
Negative urine samples from non-pregnant females were spiked with hCG standard
substance at two different hCG concentrations (0 mIU/mL and 10 mIU/mL hCG) and were
adjusted to pH values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0 before tested using the candidate
device. These samples were tested in 15 replicates using 3 lots of the proposed device by 3
different lab technicians (5 replicates per lot for each pH value). Two lots of test device were
performed using dip method, one lot of test device was performed using simulated stream
method. The results demonstrated that samples with pH range of 4 and 9 do not interfere with
either positive or negative results from the device.
Negative urine samples from nonpregnant females with different urinary specific gravities
between the range of 1.000 and 1.035 were spiked with hCG standard substance at two different
hCG concentrations (low concentration of 0 mIU/mL and 10 mIU/mL). The specific gravity
values for the samples collected and tested with the candidate device were 1.001, 1.003,
1.013, 1.021, 1.024, 1.026, 1.017, 1.019, 1.022, 1.030, and 1.031. The positive and negative
hCG results were not affected by urine specific gravity ranges between 1.001 and 1.031.
Effect of hCG β-core fragment:
Urine samples (0 and 10 mIU/mL hCG) were spiked with hCG β-core fragment at
concentrations of 102,000 pmol/L, 204,000 pmol/L, and 408,000 pmol/L and tested using 3
lots of the candidate device. All samples yielded correct results with hCG β-core fragment
concentrations up to 408,000 pmol/L.
Hook Effect:
Negative pooled human urine was spiked with hCG to concentrations up to 500,000 mIU/mL
hCG. Samples were tested in 15 replicates using 3 lots of the device by 3 operators. Samples
were tested using both device formats (two lots of the test device were tested using the dip
method while one lot of the test device was performed using the simulated stream method).
No hook effect was observed at concentrations of up to 500,000 mIU/mL hCG.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability: The hCG One Step Pregnancy Test is traceable to the 5th WHO International
Standard (IS) from NIBSC with code 07/364.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of detection was determined by using pooled negative human urine samples spiked
with 0, 3, 5, 6.25, 7.5, 8.75, 10, and 15 mIU/mL hCG. Three lots of each format of the device
were tested by 3 operators. The sensitivity of the hCG One Step Pregnancy Test was
determined to be 10 mIU/mL for both test formats.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The device cut-off is 10 mIU/mL. See Precision/Reproducibility (Section VII.A.1.) and
Detection Limit (Section VII.A.6.) sections above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The performance of the hCG One Step Pregnancy Test was evaluated by professionals at 2
sites with 2 lots of the candidate device and the predicate device. Urine samples from 158
women who were suspected of being pregnant between the ages of 18 to 45 were masked and
randomized prior to testing. The results are summarized below.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
2. Clinical Specificity:
The clinical specificity of the hCG One Step Pregnancy Test was evaluated with a total 612
women with ages ranging from 18 to 66 years old who did not expect to be pregnant at the
time of testing. A total of 612 urine samples were tested with three lots of the device. Of the
612 urine samples, 606 samples were consistently negative and six (6) of the 612 samples
were consistently positive on the hCG One Step Pregnancy Test. These corresponding
subjects were confirmed pregnant via follow up ultrasound exams. These six subjects were
excluded from the calculation of the clinical specificity. The clinical specificity was
calculated as 606/606, or 100%. There was no difference between the two test methods (dip
and midstream).
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Early Pregnancy Detection Study:
A real-world study was conducted to demonstrate the detection of hCG in Conception Cycles
relative to the day of Expected Menstrual Period (EMP) by the hCG One Step Pregnancy Test. A
total of 649 urine samples were collected from 59 different women (25-45 years old) who
planned to become pregnant. These women were followed throughout their conception cycles
with urine collected from day -9 to day +1 of their expected period. A total of 59 subjects were
confirmed pregnant with an ultrasound exam. The hCG One Step Pregnancy Test (both dip and
stream methods used for each sample) detected hCG in 68% of samples from five days before the
expected menstrual period and 100% of samples from two days before the expected menstrual
period. All positive hCG One Step Pregnancy Test results were confirmed with ultrasound
exams. There was no difference in results between the two test methods, dip or stream.
