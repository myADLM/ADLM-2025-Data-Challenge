IV Device/System Characteristics:
1. Device Description:
The SEJOY hCG One Step Pregnancy test will be sold in three formats: strip, cassette, and
midstream. Each format is qualitative lateral flow immunoassay for the detection of hCG in
human urine samples, as an aid in the detection of pregnancy. The SEJOY hCG One Step
Pregnancy Test Strip and SEJOY hCG One Step Pregnancy Test Midstream formats consist of
one test device sealed in a desiccated aluminum pouch and a package insert. The SEJOY hCG
One Step Pregnancy Test Cassette format consists of one test device, a disposable plastic
dropper, and a package insert.
2. Principle of Operation:
The SEJOY hCG One Step Pregnancy Test (strip/cassette/midstream) is a lateral flow sandwich
immunoassay employing monoclonal antibodies that are specifically directed against the alpha
and beta subunits of hCG. To use the test, the user either dips the device in the urine specimen
(strip format), adds the urine specimen to the specimen well (cassette format), or urinates on the
absorbent tip or immerses the absorbent tip in urine (midstream format). If hCG is present in the
sample, it will reach the test zone (“T”) of the membrane and form a colored line. When the test
is performed properly, a colored line will always appear in the control zone (“C”). The test result
is shown in the result window and read visually between 3 and 5 minutes of urine application.
Two distinct colored lines, one in the test region and another in the control line region indicate a
positive test result (pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the test region and only a colored line
in the control line indicates a negative test result (not pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the
control line even in the presence of a colored line in the test line region indicates an invalid test
result.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using negative urine samples spiked with hCG to obtain
samples with hCG concentrations of 0, 12.5, 18.75, 22.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 mIU/mL. Tests
were performed by three different operators for each sample concentration in 2 runs per day
for 15 days using 3 lots of each device format (strip, cassette, midstream). The device cutoff
is 25 mIU/mL hCG. The results are summarized in the tables below:

2. Linearity:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference from exogenous and endogenous substances
To evaluate the potential for interference by certain exogenous and endogenous compounds,
each interferent was prepared by diluting stock interferent material to the desired
concentration. Negative and positive female urine samples containing 0 and 25 mIU/mL
hCG, respectively, were spiked with the compounds to obtain the desired test concentration.
The samples were tested using 3 lots of each device format (strip, cassette, midstream). The
results demonstrated no interference from exogenous compounds at the following
concentrations for both negative and positive hCG urine samples.

Cross-reactivity of structurally-related compounds
To evaluate specificity and cross-reactivity, negative (0 mIU/mL hCG) and positive female
urine samples (25 mIU/mL hCG) were spiked with various concentrations of glycoprotein
hormones, including LH (500 mIU/mL), FSH (1000 mIU/mL) and TSH (1 mIU/mL). The
samples were tested using 3 lots of each device format (strip, cassette, midstream). The
results showed that there is no interference at 500 mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH, and 1
mIU/mL TSH for both negative and positive urine samples.
Effect of urine pH
To evaluate potential interference from changes in pH, urine samples containing 0 mIU/mL,
10 mIU/mL, and 25 mIU/mL hCG were tested at pH values of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The
samples were tested on all three device formats (strip, cassette, midstream). The results
demonstrated that urine samples within the pH range of 4.0 to 9.0 do not interfere with either
positive or negative results from the device.
Effect of urine Specific Gravity
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, urine samples containing
0, 12.5 and 25 mIU/mL hCG were adjusted to specific gravities of 1.000, 1.012, 1.020,
1.030, 1.037 and tested using the candidate device. The samples were tested on all three
device formats (strip, cassette, midstream). The results demonstrated that samples within the
specific gravity range of 1.000 to 1.037 do not interfere with either positive or negative
results from the device.
High dose hook effect study
Negative urine samples were spiked with varying hCG concentrations (25, 100, 1,000,
10,000, 100,000, 150,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, and 2,000,0000 mIU/mL) using 3 lots of each
device format (strip, cassette, midstream). The results showed no hook effect up to 2,000,000
mIU/mL hCG.
Effect of hCG β-core fragment
To evaluate potential interference from hCG β-core fragment, negative and positive urine
samples containing 0 and 25 mIU/mL hCG were spiked with 2,000,000 pmol/L hCG β-core
fragment. The samples were tested using 3 lots of each device format (strip, cassette,
midstream). The results demonstrated that there is no interference at 2,000,000 pmol/L hCG-
β-core fragment in either negative or positive urine samples.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
a) The performance of the three device formats (strip, cassette, midstream) of the SEJOY
hCG One Step Pregnancy test was compared to the predicate device. Testing was
performed by laboratory professionals at three point-of-care (POC) sites with urine
samples from 150 women between the ages of 18 to 60. About half of the women were
suspected to be pregnant. All samples were masked and randomized prior to testing using
each device format (strip, cassette, midstream). The data show that the agreement of the
SEJOY hCG One Step Pregnancy Test (strip, cassette, and midstream) with the predicate
device was 100%.
