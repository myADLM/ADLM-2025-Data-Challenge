IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Streck Molecular Control (SMC; trade name: MDx-Chex for BCID2) is an external positive and
negative assayed control consisting of two levels of control, Control 1- Gram negative (GN) and
Control 2- GPY (Gram positive and yeast). Each control contains stabilized human leukocytes
and erythrocytes, and inactivated bacteria in a simulated blood culture media. Both controls
contain target sequence in intact and inactivated bacterial and yeast cells, as well as antimicrobial
gene targets (in relevant pathogens that are intact and inactivated) that are detected by the
BioFire FilmArray Blood Culture Identification 2 (BCID2) Panel on FilmArray systems. MDx-
Chex for BCID2 is a full-process, cellular-based control for the BioFire BCID2 Panel that
evaluates the entire analytical process including sample lysis, nucleic acid isolation and
purification, amplification, detection, and analysis, as well as the impact of PCR inhibitors and
preanalytical variables. Each control for the MDx-Chex for BCID2 is processed separately
according to the BioFire BCID2 Panel Package Insert for patient samples.

consisted of a total of 20 samples being analyzed per lot. Eleven operators particpated in the
study with 2-4 operator per site. The study was performed on FilmArray instrument 2.0 (used
at test sites 1 and 4) and FilmArray Torch systems (used at test sites 1, 2, and 3). A total of
240 external controls were tested. Of the 240 controls tested, 10 positive controls were false
negatives, however upon retesting were confirmed as positive controls. As part of the
workflow, if an unexpected result is observed for one or more targets within a given run, that
sample may be rerun no more than one time to determine if the correct results are obstained
for the targets with unexpected results during the first run. Also, of the 10 false negatives, 6
were for not detecting the mecA/C and MREJ antimicrobil resistance gene across three of the
four test sites. This resulted in a positive percent agreement of 95.8% (n=230/240); see Table
1 below. Also, of the 240 controls tested, 1 negative control was false positive and upon
retesting was confirmed as a negative control. This resulted in a negative percent agreement
of 99.6% (n=239/240); see Table 2 below.

An internal precision study for the MDx-Chex for BCID2 was conducted over 20 non-
consequetive days by testing three different control lots. Each lot was tested on two
FilmArray Torch instruments. A total of 20 samples were tested per lot and level (Level 1-
GN and Level 2- GPY) by four operators. Samples and pouches were prepared according to
BCID2 and control instructions. All controls gave correct results except for 6 positive control
that gave false negative results, however upon retesting was confirmed as positive controls;
This resulted in a positive percent agreement of 95% (n=114/120) and a negative percent
agreement of 100% (n= 120/120); see Tables 3 and 4 below.

antimicrobial resistance genes when testing different control lots on different days. Precision
studies are acceptable.
Within-run Testing
Within-run precision was demonstrated in a separate study using a single lot of MDx-Chex
for BCID2 analyzed on a single day. Six control vials were tested for each control level
(Level 1-GN and Level 2- GPY). The samples were analyzed on the FilmArray Torch
instrument. The results are shown in Tables 5 and 6 below:

25oC). Ten samples per lot per level is being tested at day 0 (baseline= a total of 60 samples
per temperature) and a minimum of 61 days for each lot and storage condition. Each lot was
tested for different duration (Lot 20263 was tested for 77 days, Lot 20366 was tested for 75
days and Lot 21129 was tested for 63 days) and therefore the shelf-life in Table 9 was
denoted as day 61+ for each temperature tested. At baseline, 120 total tubes were tested then
divided in half for storage at the two temperatures stated above. All samples are analyzed on
the FilmArray Torch instrument. The data presented here are to support a 60 day open-vial
stability claim and data to support a longer open-vial stability claim will be submitted at a
later date. The data for the 61+ day study showed that at baseline, there were five false
negatives and three false positive, that upon retesting were correctly confirmed as postive
controls and negative controls, respectively. The data also showed that on day 61+, three
samples, stored at 20-25oC, were false negatives and were correctly confirmed as postive
controls upon retesting. Therefore, giving an overall PPA and NPA are 96.9% and 99.2%,
respectively. The results are shown in Tables 9 and 10 below.

The data for the ongoing open-vial stability study support the conclusion that MDx-Chex for
BCID2 has an open-vial stability of 60 days when stored at 2-25oC.
Closed-vial Stability
A real-time closed-vial stability study is ongoing using three lots of MDx-Chex for BCID2.
Samples were stored in a controlled refrigerated (2-8oC) or controlled room temperature (20-
25oC). Ten samples per lot per level is being tested at day 0 (baseline= a total of 60 samples
per temperature) and a minimum of 61 days (60+) for each lot and storage condition. At
baseline, 120 total tubes were tested then divided in half for storage at the two temperatures
stated above. All samples are analyzed on the FilmArray Torch instrument. The data
presented here are for at least 61 days and data to support a longer closed-vial stability claim
will be submitted at a later date. The same baseline data used for the open-vial stability study
above was used here. The closed-vial stability study data showed that on day 61+ at
refrigerated temperature, two samples were false negatives and one sample was false
positive, that upon retesting were correctly confirmed as positive controls and negative
control, respectively. The data also showed that on day 61+ at room temperature, one sample
was false positive that was correctly confirmed as negative control upon retesting. Therefore,
the overall PPA and NPA are 97.5% and 98%, respectively. The results are shown in Tables
11 and 12 below.

for BCID2 has a closed-vial stability of 60 days when stored at 2-25oC.
Real-time Stability Testing
Real-time stability studies are ongoing to support product claims for the MDx-Chex for
BCID2. Real-time stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
to be acceptable.
Shipping Stability
A shipping stability study was performed to validate the stability of MDx-Chex for BCID2
during shipment. Using a single lot, two sets of samples were simulated into a summer or
winter months profile over five days. Temperature stress conditions for Summer followed a

for Winter followed a 120-hour exposure with the following temperature profile: 5h at 22℃,
14h at 15℃, 5.5h at 22℃, 5.5h at 17℃, 10h at 22℃, 2h at -10℃, 15h at 10℃, 5h at -10℃,

stress, samples were then incubated at 2-8oC for a week prior to being tested on the
FilmArray Torch instrument. Ten samples were analyzed for each control (Level 1 and Level
2) for a total of 20 samples analyzed. Data showed that analysis using the summer profile
resulted in one false negative and one false positive that upon retesting was correctly
confirmed as a positive control and a negative control, respectively. Therefore, the overall
PPA and NPA were 97.5% individually. Results are presented in Tables 13 and 14 below.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not Applicable
2. Matrix Comparison:
The matrix of MDx-Chex for BCID2 is made of stabilized blood components (erythrocytes
and leukocytes) in a simulated blood culture media. Since the matrix is not identical to that of
the routine BCID2 assay sample, blood culture media, a test was performed to investigate the
effect of the matrix on the assay.
To confirm that the matrix has no effect on the assay or control, inactivated Streptococcus
pneumoniae was spiked into the MDx-Chex for BCID2 matrix as well as into BD BACTEC
Plus Aerobic/F culture vial with negative whole blood to simulate a clinical sample. These
samples were then tested in triplicate using the BCID2 Panel. Three replicates of each
simulated matrix with no spike-in organism were also tested to serve as negative controls.
Samples were analyzed on FilmArray Torch intrument. The results showed PPA and NPA of
