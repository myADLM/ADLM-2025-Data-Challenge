See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Strep A Rapid Test Strip (Throat Swab) is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the
qualitative detection of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus, Strep A)
antigen from throat swab specimens of symptomatic patients to aid in the diagnosis of Group A
Streptococcus bacterial infection.
All negative test results should be confirmed by bacterial culture because negative results do not
preclude infection with Group A Streptococcus and should not be used as the sole basis for
treatment.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use only
A negative result must be confirmed by culture. A negative result may be obtained if the
concentration of the Group A Streptococcus antigen present in the throat swab is not adequate or
is below the detectable level of the test.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Healgen Strep A Rapid Test Strip (Throat Sdfwab) is a qualitative, lateral flow immunoassay for
the detection of Strep A carbohydrate antigen from a throat swab. In this test, a throat swab is
collected from the patient and the Strep A antigen is extracted in the extraction tube. This test
uses a strip with antibody specific to Strep A carbohydrate antigen coated on the test line region
of the test. The test strip is immediately placed in the sample solution that migrates up through
the test strip to generate a color line in the test line region. The presence of a colored line in the
test line region indicates a positive result for detection of Strep A antigen, while its absence
indicates a negative result. To serve as a procedural control, a red line should always appear in
the control line region, indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane
wicking has occurred. If the red control line does not appear, or remains blue, the test result is
invalid.
Device Contents:
• 25 Test strips
• 25 Sterile swabs
• 25 Disposable extraction tubes (one tube for each test strip)
• 1 Reagent A (10mL; 2M Sodium Nitrite)
• 1 Reagent B (10mL; 0.2M Acetic Acid)
• 1 Positive control (1mL; Non-viable Strep A; 0.05% Proclin300)
• 1 Negative control (1mL; Non-viable Strep C; 0.05% Proclin300)
• 1 Package insert

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
Group A Streptococcus antigen reacts with the anti-Strep A antibody conjugated to the gold
particle. The complex is then bound by the anti-Strep A capture antibody and a visible red test
line appears, indicating a positive result. To serve as an onboard procedural control, a control
line observed at the control site prior to running the assay will turn red, indicating that the test
has been performed properly.

To demonstrate the reproducibility of the Healgen StrepA Rapid Test, a four-member test panel
consisting of Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615 prepared at 2 × LoD, 1 × LoD and 0.5 × LoD
concentrations, as well as a negative (diluent only) sample, was tested. The panel was tested at
three sites by two operators at each site. Each operator tested each panel member, in duplicate,
over 5 days using three lots of the device (2 operators × 3 sites × 2 replicates × 3 lots × 5 days =
180 results/panel member). The results are summarized in Table 1.

Not applicable. This is a qualitative detection assay.
2. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
A. Analytical specificity (Cross-reactivity and Microbial interference)
To evaluate the potential for cross-reactivity with the Healgen Strep A Rapid Test Strip,
microorganisms likely to be found in the respiratory tract were tested by three operators
using three lots of the device for a total of nine results for each microorganism. The test
organisms, concentrations and cross-reactivity results are shown in Table 2.
To evaluate the potential for microbial interference of Healgen Strep A Rapid Test Strip
performance, potential interfering organisms likely to be found in the respiratory tract were
tested in the presence of Streptococcus pyogenes at 2× LoD. Samples were randomized and
blinded for single replicate testing by three (3) operators with three (3) device lots . The test
organisms, concentrations and interference results are shown in Table 2.

• Internal Positive Control: A color line appearing in the control region (C) is an
internal positive procedural control. It confirms sufficient specimen volume, adequate
membrane wicking and correct procedural technique. If a color band is not visible in
the control region (C), the test is invalid.
• External Positive Control: The external positive control is provided with the Healgen
Strep A Rapid Test. It contains non-viable Group A Streptococcus in 0.05% Proclin
300.
• External Negative Control: The external negative control is provided with the
Healgen Strep A Rapid Test. It contains non-viable Streptococcus Group C in 0.05%
Proclin 300.
The instructions for use (package insert) recommends that a positive and negative external
control be tested at least once within each test kit and by each operator performing testing
within a kit. This will verify that the reagents and test strips are working properly, and the
operator is able to correctly perform the test procedure.
B. Evaluation of Control Performance:
During the Clinical Study to evaluate performance of the Healgen Strep A Rapid Test, each
operator tested five positive and five negative controls. All these control samples were
blinded and randomized. All controls gave the expected results as shown in Table 4.
Table 4. Evaluation of Control Performance of Healgen Strep A Rapid Test.

The performance when testing the positive and negative control was acceptable.
C. Specimen Storage Stability:
The instructions for use (package insert) for the Healgen Strep A Rapid Test states that
swab specimens may be stored in a clean, dry plastic tube for up to 48 hours at room
temperature or 72 hours at 2-8°C. To evaluate sample storage, negative clinical matrix
swab spiked with S. pyogenes at 2× LoD and 4 × LoD were placed in a clean plastic tube
and capped tightly. These swab samples were divided into two groups: one stored at
refrigerated (2-8ºC) and other at room temperature (15-30ºC). The results for these
samples are in Table 5.

Storage Stability is acceptable.
5. Detection of Limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) for the Healgen Strep A Rapid Test Strip was established by
testing limiting dilutions of Streptococcus pyogenes spiked onto a negative throat swab
(clinical matrix). A concentrated stock (3.6 × 107 CFU/mL) of inactivated S. pyogenes ATCC
19615 was serially diluted in saline solution. 5 µL of each dilution was pipetted onto a
negative throat swab for testing by seven operators with three lots of Healgen Strep A Rapid
Test Strip, for a total of 21 results for each dilution. The test results are shown in Table 6.

The LoD was determined to be 7.2×104 CFU/mL when 5 µL of sample was pipetted onto a
negative clinical matrix (equivalent to 360 bacteria on the swab).
The LoD for the Healgen Strep A Rapid Test Strip was also examined by using limiting
dilutions of S. pyogenes ATCC 19615 in saline and pipetting 50 µL of each dilution with
equivalent bacterial amounts as those used with the clinical matrix onto a swab. The study
results are shown in Table 7.

swab (equivalent to 360 bacteria on the swab) which is consistent with the LoD established
using negative throat swab clinical matrix.
Inclusivity:
Two strains of S. pyogenes ATCC 19615 and ATCC 49399 were tested at the level of 2 ×
LoD with 30 replicates in three lots of test kits (see Matrix Comparisons/Equivalency). Both
the strains result into 100% detection to indicate the coverage of phenotypic diversity.

2. Matrix Comparison:
A Matrix Equivalency Study was performed to evaluate the equivalency between saline solution
and natural clinical throat matrix. A collection of 360 swabs from healthy subjects were screened
for GAS using the Healgen Strep A Rapid Test Strip to produce a negative clinical matrix.
Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615 and ATCC 49399 were serially diluted in saline solution
to achieve final LoD levels of 5×, 2×, 0.5× and negative. 5 μL of each sample was added to
negative clinical matrix swabs or swabs without clinical matrix (saline solution). Three lots of
the devices with 10 replicates were tested for target levels 5×, 0.5× and negative LoD samples
producing 30 test results whereas 30 replicates were tested for the target level 2× LoD sample
generating 90 test results. The results are summarized in Table 8.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The performance of the Healgen Strep A Rapid Test Strip was evaluated at Point of Care
(POC) in Physicians’ offices located at three different geographical sites. Two throat swabs
were collected from a total of 368 patients exhibiting symptoms of pharyngitis. One swab
was used for the Healgen Strep A Rapid Test Strip and tested on site right after sample
collection. The other swab was transported to a reference laboratory for culture confirmation.
The combined performance of the Healgen Strep A Rapid Test compared to culture results is
summarized in Table 9A. The performance stratified by each site is shown in Tables 9-B-D.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The clinical study analysis included results from 368 throat swab specimens collected from three
point of care sites in the U.S. between February to May of 2017 to 2019. The prevalence of S.
pyogenes for this period in this clinical study was 55.9% (206/368) as determined by culture and
the positivity was 54.6% (201/368) as determined by the Healgen Strep A Rapid Test. No
specific reasons could be identified based on the study protocols that could explain the high
prevalence observed in this study. However, the higher-than-expected prevalence was possibly
due to prior determination to conduct the study during a peak of S. pyogenes infection season
covering Feb-May each given calendar year.
The clinical outcome stratified by age of the participants are shown in Table 10.
