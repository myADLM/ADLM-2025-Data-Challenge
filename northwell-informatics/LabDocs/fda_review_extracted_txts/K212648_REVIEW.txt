B Indication(s) for Use:
For the quantitative measurement of CK-MB in human serum and plasma (EDTA or heparin)
using the VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System.
Measurements of creatine phosphokinase and its isoenzymes are used in the diagnosis and
treatment of myocardial infarction and muscle diseases such as progressive, Duchenne-type
muscular dystrophy.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only, For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System (K083173)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITROS CK-MB Reagent Pack contains:
• 100 coated wells (antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-CK-BB binds ≥344.9 ng CK-MB/mL).
• 8.4 mL assay reagent (buffer with bovine serum albumin, bovine alpha globulins, bovine
gamma globulins and antimicrobial agent).
• 8.4 mL conjugate reagent (HRP-mouse monoclonal anti-CK-MB binds ≥344.9 ng CK-MB/mL)
in buffer with bovine serum albumin and antimicrobial agent.
Testing is performed using the VITROS CK-MB Reagent Pack and the VITROS CK-MB
Calibrators on the VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System. The current VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products CK-MB assay is susceptible to interference from biotin. Ortho has
made a modification to the manufacturing process to allow the biotinylated antibody capture
conjugate to be pre-bound to the well, thus mitigating the risk of biotin interference. The
modified product utilizes all the same antibodies and raw materials with the exception of the
addition of 0.7% Tween 20 and an increase in EDTA concentration from 0.001M to 0.030M,
both of these modifications are to improve serum/plasma agreement which required a conversion
factor in the previously cleared product.
B Principle of Operation:
An immunometric immunoassay technique is used, which involves the reaction of CK-MB
present in the sample with a microwell coated with biotinylated antibody (mouse monoclonal
anti-CK-BB bound to Streptavidin), and a Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody
conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti-CK-MB). Unbound (HRP)-labeled anti-CK-MB antibody
conjugate is removed by washing.
The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing
luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is
added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol
derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the
level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The
amount of CK-MB conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of CK-MB
present in the sample.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated using four serum pools tested on one VITROS 3600
Immunodiagnostic System using three reagent lots. The precision pools were prepared by
selecting serum samples of a desired concentration (sample 2) or by adjusting the CK-MB
concentration levels of the serum samples by spiking with either a blend of patient samples
(sample 1) or by spiking with exogenous CK-MB (samples 3 and 4). Samples were
measured for 20 days, twice a day in duplicate for a total of 80 measurements per sample in
accordance with the recommendations in the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. The results of a
representative lot are shown below.

analyzing the precision of the study. Results are shown below.

4 254 5.76 2.3%
2. Linearity:
Linearity studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI EP06-A2
guideline. In the first study, a series of nineteen proportionally related admixtures of low and
high concentration samples were tested. The samples used to prepare the mixtures were a
low serum sample and a high serum sample spiked with exogenous CK-MB antigen. Five
replicates were measured for each mid-level sample in the linearity panel and ten replicates
were measured for high and low pools in the linearity panel. All linearity levels were tested

on three reagent lots and one VITROS 3600 System. The sample concentrations ranged from
0.08 to 448 ng/mL. The deviation from linearity was < 10%. A second linearity study was
performed using native serum patient samples. The results of the linearity studies support
that the assay is linear over the claimed measuring range of 0.22- 400 ng/mL.
Auto Dilution Study
Studies were performed to analyze the recovery of samples containing high levels of CK-MB
outside the claimed measuring range of 0.22 - 400 ng/mL using 5 human serum sample
spiked with human derived CK-MB material. The results support a sample dilution ratio of
1:5 (1-part sample to 4-parts diluent) for the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CK-MB
Reagent Pack.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The VITROS CK-MB Reagent Pack was tested for interfering substances at CK-MB
concentrations of approximately 3.00 ng/mL and 50.0 ng/mL following the recommendations
in the CLSI EP07 and EP37 guidelines. Each test and control sample were run in replicates
of 5 on 3 reagent lots. The sponsor defined interference as a bias >10% when compared to
the control sample.
The following substances did not interfere with the VITROS CK-MB assay at the
concentrations shown below.

6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
determined for the VITROS CK-MB Reagent Pack based upon recommendations in the
CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. The detection limit studies were conducted using three VITROS
CK-MB assay reagent lots on one VITROS 3600 System over five working days. Each
reagent lot was calibrated on the first day of testing.
The LoB testing consisted of 20 replicates of four fluids containing no measurable CK-MB.
LoB was determined as the 95th percentile of the measurements of the blank samples. The
LoD testing consisted of 60 replicates of five neat serum samples (low levels of endogenous
CK-MB) spiked with purified CK-MB sourced from human heart tissue. The LoD was
calculated using the classical approach outlined in CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ was determined
using a precision profile approach with a %CV limit of 20%.
The results of the studies support the claims summarized in the following table:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were conducted by testing 149 serum samples in singlicate using
the modified VITROS CK-MB Reagent Pack (candidate device) using 3 reagent lots and the
unmodified VITROS CK-MB assay (predicate device) in duplicate using 2 reagent lots on
one VITROS 3600 System. For the modified device, each sample was tested using each
reagent lot. For the unmodified device, each sample was tested using each lot and the mean
for each sample was used in the comparison. The concentrations in the samples ranged from
0.61-378 ng/mL, as determined by the predicate device. Each sample was run in singleton.
Weighted Deming regression analysis was performed. The regression analysis summary of
one representative lot is shown below:

2. Matrix Comparison:
The study included samples from 49 individual whole blood donors. The following matrices
were evaluated: serum, lithium heparin plasma and K2-EDTA plasma. Samples were
unaltered, spiked using endogenous human serum samples with elevated CK-MB values, and
spiked with concentrated human CK-MB to ensure the full measuring interval of the assay
was tested.
