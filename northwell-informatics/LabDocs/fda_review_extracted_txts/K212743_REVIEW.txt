IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The MedSchenker Smart Transport Medium (STM15-A/STM20-A/STM30-A/SCS30-A) System
(“MedSchenker STM”) includes a universal transport medium that is room temperature stable
and that can sustain infectivity of a plurality of clinically important viruses during transit to the
testing laboratory. The formulation of the MedSchenker STM includes Hank’s Balanced Salt
Solution (HBSS) enriched with protein for stabilization, antimicrobial agents to minimize
bacterial and fungal contamination, and a buffer system to maintain a neutral pH.
The MedSchenker STM is provided in labeled, screw-cap tubes designed for transport of the
clinical sample. MedSchenker STM is also supplied as a sample collection kit that contains one
screw-cap tube of STM-RT (room-temperature stable) medium and a peel pouch that contains
one sterile nasopharyngeal specimen-collection swab. The MedSchenker STM is provided as
follows in Table 1:

B Principle of Operation:
The MedSchenker STM System is used to safely collect, transport, and maintain the viability of
clinically important viruses. Intended for use by Health Care Professionals, the transport system
allows for the collection of the specimen via the sterile swab, maintenance of viral particles via a
buffered salt/serum solution, prevention of microbial overgrowth via antimicrobial agents, as
well as a buffer system to maintain a neutral pH. Once the clinical sample is collected, it should
be immediately placed in the MedSchenker STM where it is then transported to the laboratory
for testing and other detection/identification methods for the presence of a target viruses.

Shelf-life: The shelf-life of the MedSchenker STM System was determined to be 12 months
from the date of manufacture, based on the data provided. The shelf-life of MedSchenker
STM System was established using an endpoint real time stability study. Three random
samples from each of three non-consecutive lots were assessed using a pH meter at day 0 and
day 12 post manufacture and the average pH of all samples analyzed was 7.3 ± 0.5. The pH
of the media was again assessed in media stored for 12 months post manufacture and showed
a pH average of 7.8 ± 0.3. The media were also assessed for any color change (from
pink/violet to any yellowing), or turbidity (any particulates) and no changes were observed at
12 months of storage. The data support a stability claim of 12 months.
Sterilization: The MedSchenker STM is not provided sterile to the end user. Sterile
nasopharyngeal CavSwabs are provided with the MedSchenker STM. The manufacturing
process of the swabs includes sterilization by electron beam irradiation set at 15 KiloGray

Culture-based Viral Recovery Studies:
Stock Preparation. Strains of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and 2), Varicella
Zoster Virus (VZV), Influenza A 2009 virus (H1N1), and Type 5 Adenovirus were used for
media validation. The following cell lines were used for viral recovery: BHĸ 21 (for HSV-1
and 2), Vero cells (for VZV), MDCK (for H1N1) and Hep-2 (for Type 5 Adenovirus). The
cell lines were grown to near confluency, harvested, diluted in DMEM with 5-10% FBS to
obtain a stock solution of 2-3x105 cells/mL and plated in microwell plates 24 hours prior to
inoculation. The following viral titers were used as the initial stock for the viral recovery
studies: HSV-1 (1.32 x 106 TCID /mL), HSV-2 (3.47 x 105 TCID /mL), VZV (6.31 x 106
50 50
TCID /mL), H1N1 (1.02 x 107 TCID /mL) and Type 5 Adenovirus (1.07 x 105
50 50
TCID /mL).

Viral recovery studies. Strains of HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, Flu A, and Adenovirus were used
for transport media validation. Each viral strain was mixed with negative nasopharyngeal
clinical matrix, followed by a 1:2 dilution with 0.85% saline to obtain diluted viral samples
for testing. CavSwabs were used to soak up 100 µL of each concentration of viruses in three
replicates. Three replicates of the inoculated swabs were then transferred into tubes with the
MedSchenker STM, one swab per tube, and incubated at room temperature (20-25oC) or
refrigerated (4-8oC) for 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours for HSV-1, HSV-2, and Adenovirus, and for
0 and 24 hours for Flu A and VZV. Each time point was assessed using 3 lots of media. After
each time point, the swabs were centrifuged and then removed from the transport media tube
and a 50 µL aliquot of the test suspension was seeded onto the appropriate host cell
monolayer and incubated at 37oC (5% CO ) for 3-5 days. Viral viability was assessed via
2
cytopathic effects (CPE) using the MTT assay. Table 2 below shows the summary and
recovery of the 1:2 dilution of each viral strain at the indicated times and temperatures. Viral
recovery is represented as TCID /mL and percent change over time.

Conclusion of the culture-based viral recovery study: The MedSchenker STM demonstrated
the recovery of HSV-1, HSV-2, and Adenovirus in all replicates at tested incubation times
and storage conditions. These data support the transportation of HSV-1, HSV-2, and
Adenovirus in MedSchenker STM at refrigerated (4-8oC) or room temperature (20-25oC) for
up to 72 hours.
The MedSchenker STM also demonstrated the recovery of VZV and Flu A in all replicates at
refrigerated (4-8oC) or room temperature (20-25oC), up to 24 hours.
Performance of the MedSchenker STM was also evaluated for mycoplasma viability at
different incubation times and temperatures. Data was insufficient to support inclusion of
mycoplasma in the intended use of the MedSchenker STM. This is reflected in the following
labeling limitation:
The MedSchenker STM was also evaluated for mycoplasma viability at different incubation
times and temperatures. Data was insufficient to support use of this medium for transport of
specimens for mycoplasma testing.
