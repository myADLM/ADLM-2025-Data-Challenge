IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit uses multiplex immunoassay, a methodology that
greatly resembles traditional ELISA, while permits simultaneous detection and identification of different
antibodies in a single well. The reaction is processed in a 96 well microtiter plate, with six polystyrene
beads embedded in each well of the plate. Four (4) different beads are coated with antigens for the
detection of IgG antibodies to Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella-Zoster Virus in human serum.
Two additional beads are included in each reaction well as filler beads. Specimen processing is fully
automated on the DYNEX Multiplier Analyzer.The assay plate incorporates four beads in each well, each
of which is individually coated with purified virus antigens to give targets for IgG binding to measles,
mumps, rubella, and varicella- zoster antigens respectively. Unbound antibodies are removed in the wash
step. Bound IgG is detected by the addition of rabbit anti-human IgG conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase.
Excess conjugate is removed in a second wash step. Luminol substrate is then added to the wells. If IgG
has bound, a chemiluminescent reaction takes place, which is detected by an integrated camera. The
luminescent signal is proportional to the IgG concentration.
B Principle of Operation:
The Multiplier Analyzer adds the human serum and reagents to each well of the 96 well plate, after which
the mixture is incubated at 37°C. After a wash cycle, unbound antibodies are removed. Anti-human IgG
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is added after which the mixture is incubated at 37°C with
shaking. A second wash step removes excess conjugate, then luminol substrate is added to each well. The
amount of antibody captured by the antigen is determined by the chemiluminescence produced by the
antigen antibody bound HRP. Raw data are captured as light photons via an imaging camera. The amount
of light photons are converted into relative light intensity units (RLU).
The Multiplier software analyzes the image and generates a report that details the mean RLU signal for
each target bead (MMRV) by test sample. In every plate a calibrator is included. The DYNEX
SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit is qualitative and produces a result defined as negative (NEG),
equivocal (EQV) or positive (POS) for each target analyte.
Interpretation of results of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit:
K212769 - Page 2 of 16

--- Page 3 ---
The results for each of the antibodies are expressed in Index units. For Measles, Mumps, Rubella and
VZV antibodies, results with Index values ≤ 0.9 Index are reported as Negative, results between >0.9 and
<1.1 Index are reported as Equivocal, and results of ≥ 1.1 Index are reported as positive, as indicated in
the table below:
Result*
Status Interpretation**
(Index value)
Negative: No detectable IgG antibodies to Measles,
Mumps, Rubella or VZV detected. Such individual is
≤0.9 NEG
presumed not to have had a previous exposure to MMRV
through infection or vaccination
Equivocal: Samples should be retested, if the result
>0.9 - <1.1 EQV remains equivocal, the samples should be tested on an
alternative method.
Positive: IgG antibodies to Measles, Mumps, Rubella, or
≥1.1 POS VZV detected. This may indicate that the individual was
exposed to MMRV through infection or vaccination
*The numeric Index value of the final result is not indicative of the amount of anti-Measles, Mumps,
Rubella, or VZV IgG antibodies present.
**Test results should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical history, epidemiological data and
other information available to the attending physician in evaluating the patient
C Instrument description Information
1. Instrument Name:
DYNEX Multiplier Analyzer
The Multiplier is a Multiplex ELISA Analyzer which measures chemiluminescent signal, allowing for the
simultaneous measurement of multiple analytes in a single well.
The DYNEX Multiplier Analyzer automates the steps of Multiplex ELISA assays, performing liquid
pipetting, plate washing and results reading of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit in
addition to producing a result report. Sample distribution, incubation, reagent addition, washing and
detection phases of the ELISA tests are fully automated.
The Multiplier hardware comprises of all the physical parts of the instrument that are controlled by the
firmware and the Multiplier software. The hardware includes an arm, incubator, pipette, camera, barcode
scanner, washer, and reader. The instrument also contains an embedded personal computer (PC) with its
own hard drive that executes the Multiplier software.
The Multiplier software consists of five main parts: Grapevine (data access layer), System Control
(software interface layer to hardware), Watchdog (a monitoring system), User Interface, and firmware.

b. Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit was evaluated using 22 serum
samples, in duplicate, twice a day, over 20 days, at three sites located in the US, using one reagent kit
lot per site. Reproducibility results are reported for each analyte separately in tables 05 to 08 below:

2. Linearity:
Not applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a. Potential Cross-reactivity:
Potential cross-reactivity for the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit was determined by
testing serum samples from individuals containing antibodies to other microorganisms or with
medical conditions unrelated to MMRV infections. The data showed no cross reactivity with various
disease state specimens evaluated, except for one specimen for HSV 2 IgG which gave an equivocal
result on the assay for Mumps IgG. Additional testing of negative samples for measles, mumps,
rubella and VZV IgG remained negative when the other three measurands in the well were positive.

* One HSV 2 IgG sample had an Equivocal result for Mumps IgG with the DYNEX SmarPLEX
MMRV Assay Kit while had a high negative result for Mumps IgG with the predicate.
** Potential cross-reactivity was not well assessed due to limited sample size.
*** Three measurands were evaluated together for potential cross reactivity
b. Potential Interfering endogenous substances:
The DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit was evaluated for potential interference of
endogenous substances using negative, low positive, and high positive serum samples for Measles,
Mumps, Rubella, and VZV IgG antibodies in the presence and absence of potential endogenous

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Calibrator:
• The Rubella calibrator and control of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit are
traceable to the WHO International Standard Anti-Rubella Immunoglobulin, Human NIBSC
code: RUBI-1-94,
• The Measles, Mumps, VZV calibrator and controls are traceable to a DYNEX internal standard.
Sample Stability:
The data support the following storage conditions for the serum samples to be tested with the
DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit:

6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable
7. Assay Cut-Off:
A study to establish the DYNE SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit cutoff was performed using 669
serum samples.
The cut-off values and assignment of the calibrators were determined by performing
concordance and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis, using predicate results as
the standard.
8. Accuracy:
Not Applicable
9. Sample Carry-Over:
The DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit is not susceptible to within-assay sample carryover.
10. High Dose Hook Effect:
The DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit is not susceptible to high dose hook effect (or
interference from specimens with high levels MMRV antibodies).
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Performance of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit was evaluated against
corresponding commercially available Measles, Mumps, Rubella and VZV immunoassays using a
total of 2512 retrospective serum samples. Serum specimens from adults (N=1676), pregnant woman
(N=500) and pediatric (N=336) were evaluated. The study was conducted at two sites. To
demonstrate the clinical performance of the DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit, Positive
Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) between the results of the
DYNEX SmartPLEX MMRV IgG Assay Kit and an FDA-cleared comparator tests were calculated.
The demographic information of the populations tested is listed below:
