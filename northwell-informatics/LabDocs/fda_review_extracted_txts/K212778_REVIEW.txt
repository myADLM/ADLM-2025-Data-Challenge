IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Alinity m EBV is an in vitro polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the quantitation of EBV
DNA in human plasma.
The steps of the Alinity m EBV assay consist of sample preparation, real-time PCR assembly,
amplification/detection, result calculation, and reporting. All stages of the Alinity m EBV
procedure are executed automatically by the Alinity m System. No intermediate processing or
transfer steps are performed by the user. The Alinity m System is designed to be a random-
access analyzer that can perform the Alinity m EBV assay in parallel with other Alinity m assays
on the same instrument.
B Principle of Operation:
The Alinity m System is designed to be a random access analyzer that can perform the Alinity
m EBV assay in parallel with other Alinity m assays on the same instrument. EBV DNA from
human plasma is extracted using the Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2, Alinity m Lysis Solution,
and Alinity m Diluent Solution. The Alinity m System employs magnetic microparticle
technology to facilitate nucleic acid capture, wash, and elution. The resulting purified DNA is
K212778 - Page 2 of 27

--- Page 3 ---
then combined with liquid unit-dose Alinity m EBV activation reagent and lyophilized unit-
dose Alinity m EBV amplification/detection reagents and transferred into a reaction vessel.
Alinity m Vapor Barrier Solution is then added to the reaction vessel which is then transferred
to an amplification/detection unit for PCR amplification and real-time fluorescence detection
of EBV.
At the beginning of the Alinity m EBV sample preparation process, a lyophilized unit-dose IC
on the AMP Tray is rehydrated by the Alinity m System and delivered into each sample
preparation reaction. The IC is then processed through the entire sample preparation and real-
time PCR procedure along with the specimens, calibrators, and controls to demonstrate proper
sample processing and validity. The Alinity m EBV amplification/detection reagents consist
of enzymes, primers, probes, and activation reagents that enable polymerization and detection.
An EBV calibration curve is required for determination of EBV DNA concentration. Two levels
of calibrators are processed through sample preparation and PCR to generate the calibration
curve. The concentration of EBV DNA in specimens and controls is then calculated from the
stored calibration curve.
Assay controls are tested at or above an established minimum frequency to help ensure that
instrument and reagent performance remains satisfactory. During each control event, a negative
control, a low-positive control, and a high-positive control are processed through sample
preparation and PCR procedures that are identical to those used for specimens.
The possibility of nucleic acid contamination on the Alinity m System is minimized because:
• Aerosol barrier pipette tips are used for all pipetting. The pipette tips are discarded after use.
• PCR amplification and detection is carried out automatically in a sealed reaction vessel.
• Disposal of the reaction vessel is performed automatically by the
Alinity m System.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of Alinity m EBV was determined by analyzing a 9-member plasma panel.
Panel members with concentrations targeted to 1.30 Log IU/mL and 2.00 Log IU/mL
(20 IU/mL and 100 IU/mL) were prepared with positive clinical sample, panel
members targeted in the range of 2.70 Log IU/mL to 5.00 Log IU/mL (500 IU/mL to
100,000 IU/mL) were prepared using cultured virus, and panel members with targeted
concentrations greater than 5.00 Log IU/mL were prepared using synthetic DNA.
Each panel member was tested in 4 replicates, twice each day for 12 days, on 3 Alinity
m Systems operated by 3 operators (one operator per instrument), using 3 AMP kit
lots (one lot per instrument), for a total of 288 replicates per panel member.
The precision study results in Table 3 and Table 4 demonstrated that Alinity m EBV
within-laboratory standard deviation (SD) was less than or equal to 0.25 Log IU/mL for
EBV DNA panels targeted in the range of 2.70 Log IU/mL to 8.30 Log IU/mL (500
IU/mL to 200,000,000 IU/mL), and less than or equal to 0.50 Log IU/mL for EBV DNA

Alinity m EBV Testing Using Dilution Procedure
The 1:2.5 dilution procedure was evaluated by comparing quantitation of neat samples and samples tested using the Alinity m EBV dilution
procedure. Five plasma panel members with EBV levels targeted in the range of 150 IU/mL to 100,000,000 IU/mL (2.18 Log IU/mL to 8.00
Log IU/mL) were tested. Each panel member was tested, neat or using the dilution procedure, in multiple replicates. For the 5 panel
members, the differences in mean (ie, diluted minus neat) ranged from -0.01 Log IU/mL to 0.23 Log IU.
Precision of Alinity m EBV Using Dilution Procedure
Precision of Alinity m EBV, using the dilution procedure, was determined by analyzing 3 plasma panel members. Panel members 1 and 2
were prepared by spiking cultured virus in EBV negative sample, and panel member 3 was prepared by spiking synthetic DNA in EBV
negative sample. Each panel member was tested in at least 3 replicates, twice each day for 12 days, on 3 Alinity m Systems with 3 Alinity m
Specimen Dilution Kit I lots and 3 Alinity m EBV AMP Kit lots by 3 operators (1 Specimen Diluent lot, 1 AMP kit lot, and 1 operator per
instrument), for a total of at least 216 replicates. The results are summarized in Table 5 and Table 6.

2. Linearity:
The quantitation range of Alinity m EBV is from the LLoQ of 50 IU/mL (1.70 Log
IU/mL) to the ULOQ of 200,000,000 IU/mL (8.30 Log IU/mL).
Linearity of Alinity m EBV was assessed by testing a dilution series of EBV type 1 in
negative human plasma, consisting of 16 panel levels targeted in the range of 10 IU/mL to
400,000,000 IU/mL (1.00 Log IU/mL to 8.60 Log IU/mL). Panel levels with
concentrations from 10 IU/mL to 1,500 IU/mL (1.00 Log IU/mL to 3.18 Log IU/mL) were

Figure 1 Alinity m EBV linearity EBV type 1
aNote: The markers in the plot represent the mean Alinity m EBV concentration (Log IU/ml) for each panel
member.
Linearity of Alinity m EBV for EBV type 2 was confirmed by testing a dilution series in
negative human plasma, consisting of 16 panel levels targeted in the range of 10 IU/mL to
400,000,000 IU/mL (1.00 Log IU/mL to 8.60 Log IU/mL). Panel levels with concentrations
from 10 IU/mL to 1,500 IU/mL (1.00 Log IU/mL to 3.18 Log IU/mL) were prepared using a
cultured virus, while panel levels with concentrations from 15 IU/mL to 400,000,000 IU/mL
(1.18 Log IU/mL to 8.60 Log IU/mL) were prepared using synthetic DNA. Panel quantitation
values were traceable to the 1st World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for
Epstein-Barr Virus for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NIBSC code: 09/260).
Alinity m EBV was linear across the quantitation range from 50 IU/mL to 200,000,000 IU/mL
(1.70 Log IU/mL to 8.30 Log IU/mL) for EBV type 2. Results for Alinity m EBV linearity
performance for type 2 and for type 1 are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Alinity m EBV linearity EBV type 1 and 2
3. Lower Limit of Quantitation
The LLoQ is defined as the lowest concentration at which EBV DNA is reliably
quantitated within an acceptable total error. Total error was estimated for detected
samples from the LoD study by 2 methods:
• Total Analytical Error (TAE) = |bias| + 2 × SD, and
• Total Error (TE) = SQRT(2) × 2 × SD.
The results of the calculations are shown in Table 7.
Panel members were dilutions of the 1st World Health Organization (WHO) International
Standard for Epstein-Barr Virus for Nucleic Acid Amplification
Techniques (NIBSC code: 09/260) prepared in EBV negative plasma.
The results of these analyses demonstrated that Alinity m EBV can determine the
concentration of EBV DNA at 50.00 IU/mL with an acceptable level of accuracy and
precision, ie, TAE and TE less than or equal to 1.00 Log IU/mL. In combination with the
linearity data this supports a claimed LLoQ of 50.00 IU/mL (1.7 Log IU/mL) for Alinity
m EBV.

Confirmation of the LLoQ Using Dilution Procedure
LLoQ for Alinity m EBV using the dilution procedure was confirmed by testing 2 panel members with a dilution factor of
1:2.5. The EBV concentrations in the panel members were targeted at 20 IU/mL and 24 IU/mL (1.30 Log IU/mL and 1.38 Log
IU/mL) after dilution in Specimen Diluent. Panel members were dilutions of cultured virus spiked into EBV-negative plasma.
A minimum of 14 replicates per day of each panel level were tested using the dilution procedure in 3 runs across 3 days (one run
per day). The study was performed using 1 Alinity m EBV AMP Kit lot, 1 Specimen Diluent lot, and 1 Alinity m System. Total
error was estimated by TAE and TE, as shown in Table 8. The accuracy and precision at 20 IU/mL and 24 IU/mL were confirmed
for Alinity m EBV testing using the 1:2.5 dilution procedure.

4. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of Alinity m EBV was evaluated with a panel of
microorganisms (Table 9) in EBV negative plasma, positive plasma targeted to 60
IU/mL EBV DNA, and positive plasma targeted to 10,000 IU/mL EBV DNA.
Microorganisms were tested at a final concentration of 105 Units/mL for viruses and
fungi or 106 Units/mL for bacteria. No cross-reactivity or interference in the performance
of the Alinity m EBV assay was observed in the presence of the tested microorganisms.

The effects of endogenous substances and the presence of high levels of therapeutic
drugs commonly prescribed in transplant patients were evaluated. Potential interference
on Alinity m EBV performance in plasma was assessed by testing 8 negative samples, 8
positive samples targeted to 60 IU/mL and 8 positive samples targeted to 10,000 IU/mL
EBV DNA.
No interference was observed in the presence of albumin (60 g/L), hemoglobin (10 g/L),
triglycerides (16.94 mmol/L), conjugated bilirubin (475 µmol/L), unconjugated bilirubin
(684 µmol/L) or human genomic DNA (2 µg/mL) that were introduced in the sample. No
interference was observed in the presence of drug compounds tested in pools or
individually that are listed in Table 10, at a concentration of 3 times the reported C or
max
higher.

6. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The Alinity m EBV Assay (List No. 09N43) was standardized against the 1st World
Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for Epstein-Bar Working Reference
Calibrators are prepared from the WHO International Standard r virus for Nucleic Acid
Amplification Techniques (NIBSC code: 09/260). Primary Calibrators are prepared by
diluting linearized EBV dual target plasmid (pEBV) and EBV DNA concentrations are
assigned based on the results of Alinity m EBV testing against the Working Reference
Calibrators.
Stability was established for the Alinity m EBV AMP kit, CTRL Kit, and CAL kit using
real time stability studies
7. Detection Limit:
EBV Type 1: The limit of detection (LoD) was determined for EBV type 1 by testing
dilutions of the 1st World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for
Epstein-Barr Virus for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NIBSC code: 09/260)
prepared in EBV negative human plasma.
Testing for each EBV DNA concentration was performed with 4 lots of amplification
reagents across multiple days. The results, representative of the analytical sensitivity
performance of Alinity m EBV, are summarized in Table 12.
Probit analysis of the data determined that the concentration of EBV DNA in plasma
detected with 95% probability (LoD by Probit) was 20 IU/mL with a 95% confidence
interval (CI) of (11.81 IU/mL, 18.22 IU/mL

9. Carry over
The carryover rate for Alinity m EBV was determined by analyzing 648 valid replicates
of EBV negative samples processed from alternating positions with 647 valid replicates
of high concentrated EBV positive samples greater than or equal to 20,000,000 IU/mL,
across a minimum of 27 runs. The carryover resulting in a detectable concentration
greater than or equal to LoD was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1% to 1.1%). The carryover resulting
in EBV detection was 1.2% (95% CI: 0.6% to 2.4%).
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Alinity m EBV results were compared to those of an FDA-cleared EBV nucleic acid test in a
representative study. A total of 558 EDTA plasma samples were tested (neat or diluted),
including 542 clinical specimens from hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid
organ transplant (SOT) subjects, and 16 contrived samples prepared by spiking inactivated
EBV virus into the individual clinical specimens. The Alinity m EBV assay testing was
performed at 3 clinical testing sites with 3 Alinity m EBV reagent kit lots.
Of the 558 samples, 550 produced valid results with Alinity m EBV and the comparator assay,
including 388 samples detected by Alinity m EBV and 162 samples not detected by Alinity m
EBV. Out of 550 valid samples, 168 were from HSCT subjects, 379 were from SOT subjects,
and 3 were from dual transplant (HSCT/SOT) subjects. The agreement between Alinity m EBV
and comparator results is shown in Table 15 (HSCT samples), Table 16 (SOT samples) and
Table 17 (HSCT and SOT samples combined).

a The LLoQ used here is the higher LLoQ between Alinity m EBV and comparator.
Discordant results were defined as those that are more than one box away from the diagonal
(indicated by shading). For Target Not Detected (TND) by Comparator Column Agreement, the
Alinity m EBV Target Not Detected and < LLoQ cells were combined. The rationale for adding
the adjacent < LLoQ and TND cells for the TND column was that the difference between a TND
and < LLoQ were not clinically meaningful and that these were analytically at the lower end of the
quantitation range, which may be impacted by random error.
Of the 550 samples, 44 were collected for the estimation of Negative Percent Agreement (NPA)
and were confirmed as EBV DNA negative. For this subset of confirmed EBV DNA negative
clinical specimens, the NPA with the comparator assay was 100.0% (44/44) with a 95% CI of
(92.0%, 100.0%
Agreement between Alinity m EBV assay and the comparator assay was also evaluated using
different clinical thresholds and is shown in Table 18 (HSCT samples). and Table 19 (SOT
samples) Table 20 (HSCT and SOT samples combined).

2. Matrix Comparison:
Compatibility of Alinity m EBV with specimens collected as plasma in Di-potassium
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (K2 EDTA) tubes, Tri-potassium EDTA (K3 EDTA)
tubes, and Plasma Preparation Tubes (PPT) was evaluated.
The acceptance criteria for each sample collection tube type at each EBV positive level
tested was met. All valid EBV positive samples targeted at 60-150 IU/mL reported a
“Detected” interpretation (100% “Detected” result). The mean difference between the test
condition and the control condition across tube types ranged from 0.03 to 0.05 Log
IU/mL.
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data:
Reproducibility performance of Alinity m EBV was evaluated by testing a 9-member
reproducibility panel, including 8 positive panel members and 1 negative panel member. The
positive panel members were prepared using an EBV positive clinical specimen, cultured
virus, or plasmid DNA diluted in human EDTA plasma. The concentration levels targeted for
the reproducibility panels spanned the quantitation range of the assay. A total of 3 Alinity m
EBV AMP Kit lots, 3 Alinity m EBV CAL Kit lots, 3 Alinity m EBV CTRL Kit lots and 3
Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2 lots were used. Three clinical sites each tested 2 unique reagent
lot combinations (consisting of 2 Alinity m EBV AMP Kit lots along with 1 lot of each Alinity
m EBV CAL Kit, Alinity m EBV CTRL Kit and Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2) on 5 non-
consecutive days for each lot combination. Six replicates of each panel member were tested on
each of 5 days to ensure a minimum of 5 valid replicates for analysis. The reproducibility
results are summarized in Table 22 and Table 23 (for the positive panel members) and Table
24 (for the negative panel member).
