advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do
not affect the intended use).
The Intended Use/Instructions for Use have not changed, but language has been harmonized
to align with recent VITEK 2 antimicrobials. In addition, The VITEK 2 Compact instrument
is now included in the Intended Use since the VITEK 2 Compact performance was similar to
VITEK 2 System as demonstrated in K050002.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams,
engineering drawings, photographs, user's and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to
demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified
device has not changed.
The change was for reanalysis of MIC results for Staphylococcus spp. with linezolid
using currently recognized interpretative criteria.
bioMérieux also tested 11 S. epidermidis clinical stock linezolid-resistant isolates and 20 S.
haemolyticus clinical stock isolates to assess performance. All testing was performed with
the auto dilution method at a single external clinical site. The methods used to provide data to
support this change were in conformity to those outlined in CLSI M07, Methods for Dilution
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard –
11th Edition; January 2018.
4. Comparison Information (i.e., similarities and differences) to the submitter's legally marketed
predicate device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics.
5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification
on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation
activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
The device performance for Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus spp. was evaluated in
K032766. Please refer to K032766 for results obtained with the bioMérieux VITEK 2 AST-
Gram Positive Linezolid when compared to results obtained with the CLSI reference agar
dilution method.
Staphylococcus spp. Performance Study:
A supplemental clinical study was conducted in accordance with the Class II Special Controls
Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry
and FDA, issued August 28, 2009 (AST Guidance document). Supplemental testing was
performed at one external clinical site. All reference method testing follows CLSI approved agar
dilution testing conditions, which consisted of:
• Medium: Mueller Hinton agar with the appropriate dilutions of antimicrobial solution
added
• Inoculum: Direct colony suspension
• Incubation: 35°C; 16-20 hours

Previously collected clinical and challenge data and newly collected clinical data of 390 isolates
of Staphylococcus spp. (337 clinical and 53 challenge isolates) were reanalyzed using the current
FDA-recognized breakpoints using auto dilution method. Results obtained with the auto dilution
method were acceptable (Table 1).

yielded an EA of 82.9% (29/35) and an CA of 97.1% (34/35). There was one major error (2.9%%, 1/35).
For supplemental testing, DensiChek was used for the preparation of inoculum for the VITEK 2
AST cards in the trial and standardized daily. Two quality control organisms, Enterococcus
faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, were tested throughout
comparative testing by both the VITEK 2 AST-GP Linezolid and reference agar dilution
methods. The QC organisms were tested a minimum of twenty times by both the VITEK 2 card
and reference method. QC results for the VITEK 2 AST-GP Linezolid were within expected
results’ range >95% of the time for automatic dilution mode of the VITEK 2.
Performance of all clinical and challenge isolates for linezolid using the automatic dilution
method were stratified by organism and the results were acceptable (Table 2). Performance of all
challenge isolates for linezolid using the manual dilution method stratified by organism remains
unchanged from K032766. A trending analysis was conducted using the combined clinical and
challenge data for all organisms. Evaluation of the results for S. haemolyticus showed a trend
toward higher MIC values using the auto-dilution method (Table 3).

To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GP Linezolid when revised breakpoints for
linezolid are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the
linezolid device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
The data included in this submission supported the sponsor’s proposal to revise the following
from the device instructions for use:
1. Updated performance for Staphylococcus spp. using the currently-recognized interpretive
criteria for linezolid and Staphylococcus spp. (as noted on the FDA Susceptibility Test
Interpretive Criteria website (STIC).

2. Added the following footnotes under the table Performance Characteristics
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing in the labeling:
“VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Linezolid MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or
at least one doubling dilution higher when testing Staphylococcus haemolyticus
compared to the CLSI reference agar dilution method.”
“When evaluating performance of the clinical and challenge isolates, testing with
Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates yielded an EA of 82.9% (29/35) and an CA of
97.1% (34/35). There was one major error (2.9%%, 1/35).”
3. Removed S. epidermidis from the limitation regarding lack of resistant isolate availability
in the labeling. The modified limitation is shown below:
“The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s) is
unknown because resistant strains were not available at the time of comparative testing:
• [lzn02n]
Linezolid: Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus
haemolyticus, Streptococcus agalactiae”
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter's description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information
between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific
technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as
specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined
substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their pre-amendment) device.
