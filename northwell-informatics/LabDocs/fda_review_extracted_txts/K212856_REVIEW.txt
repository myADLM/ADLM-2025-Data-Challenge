RT Medium. After the collected sample is placed into the transport media, it is transported to the
laboratory. The media can be maintained at room temperature but for optimal performance the
specimen should be refrigerated at 2 - 8°C while in transit.
B Principle of Operation:
The neutral environment (7.0~7.8) provided by Hank’s buffer aids in the stability of the viruses.
Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) acts as a protein stabilizer, forming a protective film on the
protein shell of the virus, making it less likely to break down and ensuring the integrity of the
virus. Gentamicin sulfate, amphotericin B, and colistin inhibit growth of bacteria or yeast. L-
glutamic acid serves as an auxiliary energy source to keep cell and virus stability. HEPES buffer
provides additional help to maintain a stable pH value environment thus increases the stability of
virus. Phenol red is a pH indicator which serves as a visual quality control mechanism. The
medium is isotonic and non-toxic to mammalian host cells.

Shelf Life:
The shelf life for the iClean VTM-RT kit was determined to be 12 months from the date of
manufacture when stored in a clean, dry, ventilated environment at 20 – 25oC. The shelf life
of the iClean VTM-RT kit was established using real-time aging performance test at time
points T = 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. At each time point, appearance, volume, pH, antibiotic
stability, and recovery study were assessed.

To evaluate appearance stability, three lots of iClean VTM were physically or visually
examined for real-time aging at timepoints T = 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The media
was stored in a clean, dry, ventilated environment at 20 – 25oC. At each time point,
appearance of the product was inspected visually to be clear (i. e. no turbidity, no cloudy
nor precipitation) and maintains a pink color (i. e. no color change from pink to yellow).
Media volume was assessed to ensure each tube was filled to 3.0 mL. All results were
acceptable and support the claim that the VTM-RT kit is physically or visually stable for
12 months.
b. pH Stability
The pH of the media was used as one of the indicators to support product stability. The
media was tested at time points T = 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the manufacturing
date. Three lots of VTM-RT media were stored in a clean, dry, ventilated environment
under the recommended temperature conditions (20 – 25oC) and at the specified time
intervals, 15 tubes from each of the three lots were removed from storage. The media
inside each of the vials was evaluated using a calibrated pH meter. For all the tubes at
each time point for each of the three lots, the pH was within the predefined pH range of
7.4 ± 0.4.
c. Antibiotic Stability:
iClean VTM-RT contains gentamicin sulfate, amphotericin B, and colistin to inhibit
growth of bacteria or yeast. Stability of these antibiotics was evaluated through
inoculating 5.0 x 105 – 4.5 x 106 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538,
Escherichia coli ATCC 8099, and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 into iClean VTM
media followed by appropriate storage and incubation. The inoculated media was tested
immediately or stored in VTM for 24 hrs. and 48 hrs. Spiked media was transferred by
pipetting 0.5 mL onto nutrient agar plates for S. aureus and E. coli and Sabouraud media
for C. albicans. All plates evaluated at time T = 0 had 9.0 x 104 cfu/mL growth or greater
while plates evaluated at 24 and 48 hrs. all had no growth.
d. Sterilization:
The iClean VTM kit is not claimed to be sterile nor is it intended to be sterilized by the
end user. To decrease the chances of contamination the media uses specific
manufacturing steps including sterilization of tubes and packaging by gamma radiation
set at a dose of 5.3 Kilo Gray (KGy), in accordance with ISO 11137-2:2015. The media
is filtered using a 0.22 µm sterile fiber membrane and then is aseptically filled into the
pre-sterilized tubes. The aseptic status of the filtered iClean VTM-RT was then validated
by a quality control process which evaluates the absence of growth of bacteria and fungi
by spreading 0.1 mL of the filtered VTM-RT medium on nutrient agar and Sabouraud
media plates and incubated at 35oC ± 2oC for 24 – 48 hours. No growth on any of the
plates tested was observed.
The results collectively for appearance, volume, pH, antibiotic stability support the 12-
month stability claim for the iClean VTM-RT kit.

Performance Testing - Recovery Studies:
Performance of the iClean VTM was evaluated by Culture-Based Recovery Studies for viral
and bacterial test strains. For Viral Recovery Studies, Fluorescent Foci Count method was
utilized to evaluate the recovery of Influenza A (ATCC VR-544), Parainfluenza 3 (ATCC
VR-93) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (ATCC VR-1401). This method was also utilized to
evaluate the recovery of Chlamydia pneumoniae (ATCC VR-53592) and C. trachomatis
(ATCC VR-880). For Bacterial Recovery Studies, Roll-Plate and Swab Elution Methods
were utilized to evaluate the recovery of Mycoplasma hominis (ATCC VR-14027).
Performance testing included nine lots of media. Each performance study summarized below
used media lots that represents “New” for newly manufactured media, “Mid” for middle aged
media (~5 months old) and “Old” for older media about to expire or recently expired media.
Viral and Chlamydial Recovery Studies:
Virus stocks were diluted in pooled negative clinical matrix and each chosen dilution was
inoculated into swab and placed into iClean VTM to store at 4ºC and 25ºC for 0, 24 and 48
hours respectively. For tissue culture, Hep-2 cells (ATCC CCL-23) or McCoy cells (ATCC
CRL-1696) were grown to 95% confluency. When tissue culture plates were ready, 200 µl of
each test samples were used to infect the monolayers and incubated. For detection, specific
immunofluorescent antibody staining was used. The number of infectious particles were
counted as Fluorescent Foci and calculated for each storage temperature and time points.
McCoy cell cultures were used for the recovery of Chlamydia pneumoniae (ATCC VR-
53592) and C. trachomatis (ATCC VR-880). The results are presented in the Table 1 and
Table 2 below. Any reduction in the foci count for the timepoints (0 to 48 hr.) was shown as
percent decline.

Bacterial Recovery Studies:
Performance of iClean VTM for bacterial recovery was determined using roll plate swab
elution methods. Both the roll plate and swab elution studies follow the FDA recognized
sections of CLSI M40-A2:2014 Quality Control of Microbiological Transport Systems;
Approved Standard – Second Edition.
Roll-plate method:
For the roll-plate method, Mycoplasma hominis suspensions were prepared to approximately
0.5 McFarland standard (1.5 × 108 CFU/mL) in 0.85% physiological saline followed by 10-
fold serial dilutions in pooled negative matrix. Swabs in triplicate were spiked with 100 µL
of each dilution and placed in the iClean VTM and maintained under refrigerated or at room
temperature. After 0, 24 and 48 hours, the swabs were removed and rolled directly onto agar
plates which were incubated to grow colonies. Average CFU/roll-plate calculated for each
timepoints were presented in Table 3 and Table 4. According to CLSI M40 A2 guidelines,
the inoculum dilutions yielding time-zero plates with closely approaching 300 CFU was used
to complete the viability studies. The acceptance criteria were set to a recovery of ≥ 10 CFU
following the specified maintenance time at the iClean VTM.

Swab Elution Method:
For the swab elution method, the Mycoplasma hominis inocula were prepared in a manner
similar to that for the roll-plate method. The initial bacterial suspensions were diluted by 10-4
and dispensed 100 µL onto swabs in triplicate. The swabs were then placed in the iClean
VTM and maintained under refrigerated or at room temperature for the specified timepoints.
After 0, 24, and 48 hours the swabs were removed, and 10-fold serial dilutions were
prepared. From each of the dilution, 50 µL was dispensed onto the agar plate and incubated
to allow the growth of colonies. The results calculated in average CFU/mL for the specified
time points are presented in Table 5 and 6. According to CLSI document M40-A2, the
acceptance criteria for viability in the swab elution method was considered to be no more
than a 3 log change in CFU count between the zero-time and the 48 hours – time points.
