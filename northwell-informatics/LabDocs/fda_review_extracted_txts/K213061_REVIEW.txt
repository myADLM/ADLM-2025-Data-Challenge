IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of:
• SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Meter
• SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Test Strips
• OKmeter Control Solution (Levels I and II)
OKmeter Control Solutions and SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Test Strips can be purchased
separately.
B Principle of Operation:
The SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System (Model OK-2MJB) quantitatively
measures the amount of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip and alternative
sites including the palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh. Blood is applied to the end tip of
the test strip, and is then automatically pulled into the reaction cell through capillary action. The
enzyme consisting of glucose dehydrogenase with its cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide
(GDH-FAD) and mediator deposited onto the reaction area of the test strip reacts with the
glucose in the blood sample to produce an electric current, which is proportional to the amount
of glucose in the sample. The meter measures the strength of the current and displays the
corresponding blood glucose concentration. The meter provides plasma-equivalent results.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Meter
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples are to be tested immediately upon collection.
4. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The meter is automatically
coded.
K213061 - Page 3 of 15

--- Page 4 ---
5. Quality Control:
The sponsor manufactures 2 levels of OKmeter Control Solutions (Levels I and II). Each test
strip vial is marked with a control solution range. The labeling includes instructions to use
the C key when conducting control solution testing to prevent the results from being included
in the blood result averages. The user is instructed in the labeling to compare the control
results with the expected control ranges printed on the strip vial. Users are given instructions
on when to conduct control solution testing and to call customer service if repeat testing with
control material is out of range.
This medical device product has functions subject to FDA premarket review as well as functions
that are not subject to FDA premarket review. For this application, if the product has functions
that are not subject to FDA premarket review, FDA assessed those functions only to the extent
that they either could adversely impact the safety and effectiveness of the functions subject to
FDA premarket review or they are included as a labeled positive impact that was considered in
the assessment of the functions subject to FDA premarket review.

2. Linearity:
The claimed measuring range of the candidate device is 20-600 mg/dL. Linearity was
evaluated using 3 lots of test strips, 10 meters, and 11 venous whole blood samples with the
following mean glucose concentrations when measured on the YSI 2300 comparator method:
19.8, 50.2, 90.0, 121.3, 149.3, 250.3, 351.5, 450.3, 548.8, 600.3, and 701.0 mg/dL. Blood
glucose concentration values obtained on the SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring
System were compared to those obtained using the YSI 2300 comparator method. The
results of linear regression analysis are summarized below:
Lot 1: y = 1.0055x - 1.4364; R2 = 0.9995
Lot 2: y = 0.9992x + 0.0577; R2 = 0.9999
Lot 3: y = 0.9993x + 1.3448; R2 = 0.9998
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20-600
mg/dL.
If a glucose result is less than 20 mg/dL, “LO” is displayed on the meter. If a glucose result
is more than 600 mg/dL, “HI” is displayed on the meter. The “LO” and “HI” functions were
validated and demonstrated to function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To assess potential interference from endogenous and exogenous substances on glucose
measurements from the SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System, a study was
conducted using venous whole blood samples adjusted to the following glucose levels as
measured by the YSI 2300 comparator method: 51-70, 111-130, and 225-270 mg/dL. Each of
these samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool, with each of the potential
endogenous and exogenous interfering substances added to the test pool. Four (4) levels of
each of the potentially interfering substances were prepared and tested using 3 lots of test
strips and 10 meters, for a total of 30 replicates per test sample. Control samples were tested
using 3 lots of test strips and 10 meters for a total of 30 replicates per control sample. The
differences in meter results between the test sample and the control sample were calculated.
The table below summarizes the results. At the following concentrations, the difference
between the test samples and control samples was ≤ ±10%.

The sponsor lists the following limitations in the SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring
System User Guide and the SuperCheck Pro Test Strip Insert:
• Do not use this device while taking acetaminophen or acetaminophen containing
drugs (such as certain cold and flu remedies or certain prescription drugs, when
acetaminophen in your blood >8 mg/dL). You may receive incorrect results if you
have recently taken any acetaminophen.
• If you are taking a high level of vitamin C (ascorbic acid level in your blood > 5
mg/dL), your blood glucose results may not be reliable. If you are unsure, ask your
doctor.
• If you have a disease or condition that elevates your blood uric acid level (Uric acid
level in your blood > 10 mg/dL) such as gout, your blood glucose results may not be
accurate with the system. If you are unsure, ask your doctor.
• Do not test blood glucose during or soon after a xylose absorption test. Xylose in the
blood can give falsely elevated results.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The system is traceable to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standard
reference material NIST SRM #917c. A method comparison was performed using the
candidate device and a YSI 2300 comparator method. The meter provides plasma-equivalent
results.
Test Strip Stability:
Test strip (vials and individually wrapped pouches of strips) stability was assessed using real
time stability studies. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable
to support the labeling claims that vialed test strips are stable for 180 days after first being
opened, and that closed vials and individually wrapped pouches are stable for 30 months
when stored between 39.2ºF to 104ºF (4ºC-40ºC) and 10-85% relative humidity.

Lay-user Performance study:
A lay user performance study was conducted with a total of 350 participants to assess the
performance of the SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The participants
were responsible for obtaining their own capillary sample and performing a blood glucose
test using only the instructions from the product labeling in English. Results were analyzed
by comparing blood glucose results from capillary whole blood on the SuperCheck Pro
Blood Glucose Monitoring System obtained by the lay user against results obtained on the
YSI 2300 comparator method. The glucose concentrations of the samples ranged from 43.3
to 456 mg/dL, which included 15 native samples with glucose levels < 80 mg/dL and 50
samples with glucose levels > 250 mg/dL, as measured by the YSI 2300 comparator method.

Accuracy at Extreme Glucose Study:
An accuracy study was performed to evaluate the performance of the SuperCheck Pro Blood
Glucose Monitoring System in the extreme lower and upper ends of the claimed glucose
measuring range using capillary whole blood samples from 10 volunteers. Each of the ten
volunteer capillary whole blood samples was used to prepare 10 samples for a total of 100
samples. Fifty (50) samples were altered by glycolysis to achieve glucose concentrations
below 80 mg/dL and the other 50 samples were spiked to achieve glucose concentrations
greater than 250 mg/dL. The 100 samples were tested using 3 test strip lots, and the glucose
results using the candidate device compared to results obtained on the YSI 2300 analyzer are
summarized below:

Usability:
At the end of the lay user performance study, each participant was asked to complete a
usability questionnaire regarding ease of understanding of information in the user manual and
the ease of use when performing a blood glucose test with the SuperCheck Pro Blood
Glucose Monitoring System. From the sponsor’s analysis of the questionnaire responses, the
participants were satisfied with the ease of operation following the instructions for use in the
labeling and with their overall ability to conduct testing with the candidate device.
Readability:
A Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted on the user manual and the test strip
insert and demonstrated that the overall readability was at an 8th grade level or lower.

D. Clinical Cut-Off:
Not Applicable.
E. Expected Values/Reference Range:
The following statements regarding expected glucose values for people without diabetes are
included in the device labeling:
“The fasting blood glucose range for a nondiabetic person is less than 100 mg/dL and less than
140 mg/dL up to 2 hours after meals. These are expected values for people without diabetes.
Users should cooperate with their healthcare professional to determine their target blood glucose
values.”

F. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit:
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, venous blood samples were adjusted to hematocrit levels of 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%,
42%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%. Each sample was then adjusted to achieve 5 glucose
concentrations within the following ranges (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, and 251-400
mg/dL). Each blood sample at each condition was tested using 10 SuperCheck Pro Blood
Glucose Meters using 3 lots of test strips, and was also tested on the YSI 2300 comparator
method. The values for each level of glucose were compared to results using the YSI 2300
comparator method, and to the normal hematocrit sample. The results support the claimed
hematocrit range of 20%-60% for the SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
2. Sample Volume:
A minimum sample volume study was performed to verify the minimum test strip sample
volume requirement and the test strip fill error function established for the candidate device.
Three lots of test strips on 10 meters were tested using venous blood samples at 3
concentrations (50-65, 100-120, and 200-250 mg/dL) at each condition. Blood at each
concentration was applied to strips at 4 target sample volumes of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 μL.
The study results supported the minimum sample volume claim of 0.5 μL for the system.
The meter either displays an error message or does not start the test if not enough blood is
added to the test strip. This feature was validated and was shown to function as intended.
3. Altitude Study:
To evaluate the effect of altitude on the SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System,
meters were tested in mountains at elevations of 298, 4,790, and 11,161 feet above sea level
using whole venous blood samples adjusted to 5 concentration levels of glucose ranging from
30-400 mg/dL. At each elevation, each glucose sample was tested using 10 meters and 3 lots
of test strips for a total 30 replicates. The results obtained on the candidate device were
K213061 - Page 13 of 15

--- Page 14 ---
compared with the results obtained with the YSI 2300 comparator method. The results
support the claim that glucose measurement performance of the SuperCheck Pro Blood
Glucose Monitoring System is maintained at altitudes up to 11,161 feet (3,402 meters).
4. Operating Conditions:
The effect of temperature and relative humidity on the SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose
Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples adjusted to
approximately 3 glucose concentration ranges: 30-50, 111-150, and 251-400 mg/dL. Testing
was conducted under the following temperature and relative humidity (RH) combinations:
46.4°F (8°C) at 5% and 90% RH; 50°F (10°C) at 10% and 85% RH; 104°F (40°C) at 10%
and 85% RH; 107.6°F (42°C) at 5 and 90% RH; 23°C at 50% RH. Each glucose
concentration at each condition was tested using 10 meters and 3 lots of test strips for a total
of 30 replicates. Values were compared to results from the YSI 2300 comparator method.
The study results support the operating conditions claim of 50-104°F (10-40°C) with relative
humidity of 10% to 85%.
5. Infection Control Studies:
The SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for single-patient use
only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the external meter materials by an
outside commercial testing laboratory to demonstrate complete inactivation of hepatitis B
virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, the PDI Super Sani-Cloth Germicidal Disposable
Wipe (EPA Reg. No. 9480-4).
Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor to demonstrate that there was no
change in performance or change in the external materials of the meter after 520 cleaning and
disinfection cycles with the PDI Super Sani-Cloth Germicidal Disposable Wipes. The
robustness studies were designed to simulate single-patient use with cleaning and
disinfection twice per week for five years.
Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection
procedures.
6. Flex Studies:
Flex studies were performed demonstrating that the SuperCheck Pro Blood Glucose
Monitoring System is robust to sample perturbation, testing with used test strips, intermittent
sampling, testing outside of the specified operation condition range, shipping, drop and
vibration.
7. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and EMC
testing had been performed and the system was found to be compliant.
8. Test Strip Lot Release
The test strip lot release protocols and criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
