VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run Precision (Repeatability):
A within-run precision study using 3 lots of Accu-Chek Guide Test Strips was performed.
Venous blood was spiked to 8 concentrations (i.e. 20, 40, 80, 130, 200, 325, 450, and 550
mg/dL). For each sample concentration, 10 meters were used, with 10 measurements taken
by each meter, and 3 lots tested (i.e. 100 measurements per concentration per lot). Glucose
reference results were determined using a comparator method.
Results for the within- run precision study are summarized below:

2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated using three reagent lots and 36 Accu-Chek Guide Solo diabetes
manager blood glucose meters by testing venous blood samples spiked with glucose at
concentrations ranging from 5.2 to 603.2 (5.2, 14, 38.8, 60.8, 89.7, 123.4, 155.7, 198.8, 289,
449.4, 603.2) mg/dL, as measured by the comparator method. One run (across all 36 meters)
was performed with each sample using each of the strip lots. The values from the meter were
compared with those obtained from the comparator method. The results from regression
analysis are summarized below:
Test Strip Lot Slope Y-Intercept R2
1 0.97 0.0969 0.9983
2 0.95 0.51 0.9976
3 0.96 1.55 0.9983
All Lots Pooled 0.96 0.7189 0.9981
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to 600
mg/dL. The meter will display “LO” when the result is less than 20 mg/dL and “HI” when
result is greater than 600 mg/dL. The sponsor validated the “LO” and “HI” functions and
demonstrated that they functioned as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used a venous whole blood sample adjusted to 3
different glucose levels, split into a control sample and a test sample. Various endogenous
and exogenous substances were then added to the test sample only. The % difference
between the test and control sample was calculated and the concentration tested at which no
significant interference was observed is presented in the table below:
Potential Interfering Highest Concentration with
Substance no Significant Interference
Acetaminophen 20 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid 6 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated and 60 mg/dL
unconjugated)
Cholesterol 500 mg/dL
Creatinine 30 mg/dL

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:
• Abnormally high concentrations (greater than 5 mg/dL) of ascorbic acid (vitamin C)
may cause inaccurate results. High-dose vitamin C therapy that would result in
abnormally high concentrations is typically prescribed by your healthcare
professional. If you are not sure if this applies to you, please check with your
healthcare professional.
• Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing since xylose may cause
inaccurate results. Xylose absorption testing is performed under the supervision of a
healthcare professional. Ask your healthcare professional how long to wait after
xylose testing before performing a blood glucose test.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1) Hematocrit Study:
The protocols and acceptance criteria for the Accu-Chek Guide Solo Diabetes Manager blood
glucose monitoring system are being leveraged from the previously cleared in K160944 and
found to be acceptable. Briefly, different hematocrit levels was evaluated using whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 10 – 65% (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 %) spiked
with glucose to achieve target concentrations between 30-50, 51- 110, 111-144, 150-250, 251-
400 mg/dL. A total of 10 replicates per run, per strip lot, per hematocrit level, and per glucose
level were tested on 30 Accu-Chek Guide meters. The results demonstrated that the Accu-Chek
Guide produces accurate results over the claimed hematocrit range of 10 – 65%.

2) Altitude Study:
The protocols and acceptance criteria for the Accu-Chek Guide Solo Diabetes Manager blood
glucose monitoring system are being leveraged from the previously cleared in K160944 and
found to be acceptable. Briefly, capillary fingerstick blood samples from 102 donors using three
lots of Accu-Chek guide glucose test strips were tested at 10,150 feet above sea level using
Accu-Chek Guide glucose meters. The meter results support the claims in the labeling that
altitudes up to 10,150 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurement.
3) Flex Studies:
The following additional flex studies were performed with the Accu-Chek Guide Solo Diabetes
Manager blood glucose monitoring system: system operating conditions testing, short sample
detection, sample perturbation, intermittent sampling, and used test strips, drop, and shipping
testing. The testing demonstrated that the device is robust under these conditions.
4) Infection Control Studies:
The device is intended for single patient use. Six Accu-Chek Guide Solo Diabetes Manager
meters were subjected to 208 cleaning cycles, representing one cleaning per week for four years.
Three meters were used for control/reference purposes that were not subjected to cleaning. The
study demonstrated that cleaning the meter did not impact device durability or function.
Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials compromising the meter with the
chosen disinfectant, Super Sani-Cloth (EPA registration #9480-4), demonstrating complete
inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Robustness studies were also performed by the
demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter after
208 cleaning and disinfection cycles (representing weekly disinfection for four years, the
expected lifetime of the meter).
5) Test strip lot release criteria:
The test strip lot release protocols and criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
6) Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and EMC testing
had been performed and the system was found to be compliant.
