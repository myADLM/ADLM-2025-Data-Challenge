C Type of Test:
A multiplexed nucleic acid test intended for use with the GenMark ePlex instrument for the
simultaneous qualitative in vitro detection and identification of multiple bacterial nucleic acids
from positive blood culture specimens.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The GenMark ePlex Blood Culture Identification Gram-Negative (BCID-GN) Panel is a
qualitative nucleic acid multiplex in vitro diagnostic test intended for use on GenMark’s ePlex
Instrument for simultaneous qualitative detection and identification of multiple potentially
pathogenic gram-negative bacterial organisms and, select determinants associated with
antimicrobial resistance in positive blood culture. In addition, the ePlex BCID-GN Panel is
capable of detecting, several gram-positive bacteria (Pan Gram-Positive assay) and several
Candida species (Pan Candida assay) in positive blood culture. The ePlex BCID-GN test is
performed directly on blood culture samples identified as positive by a continuous monitoring
blood culture system and which contain gram-negative organism.
The following bacterial organisms and genes associated with antibiotic resistance are identified
using the ePlex BCID-GN Panel: Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacteroides fragilis, Citrobacter,
Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter cloacae complex, Enterobacter (non-cloacae complex),
Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus
influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae group, Morganella morganii, Neisseria
meningitidis, Proteus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, Serratia,
Serratia marcescens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, CTX-M (blaCTX-M), IMP (blaIMP) ,
KPC (blaKPC) , NDM (blaNDM), OXA (blaOXA) (OXA-23 and OXA-48 groups only), and
VIM (blaVIM).
The ePlex BCID-GN panel contains assays for the detection of genetic determinants associated
with resistance to antimicrobial agents including CTX-M(blaCTX-M), which is associated with
resistance to extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-mediated resistance to penicillins,
cephalosporins and monobactams, as well as OXA (blaOXA) (OXA-23 and OXA-48 groups
only), KPC (blaKPC), and metallo-beta-lactamases IMP (blaIMP), VIM (blaVIM), and NDM
(blaNDM), which is associated with carbapenemase-mediated resistance. The antimicrobial
resistance gene detected may or may not be associated with the agent responsible for disease.
Negative results for these select antimicrobial resistance assays do not indicate susceptibility, as
there are multiple mechanisms of resistance in gram-negative bacteria.
The ePlex BCID-GN Panel also contains targets designed to detect a broad range of organisms
with a potentially misleading Gram stain result or organisms that may be missed by Gram
staining altogether, for example in the case of co-infections. These include a broad Pan Gram-
Positive assay (which is designed to detect Bacillus cereus group, Bacillus subtilis group,
K213236 - Page 2 of 14

--- Page 3 ---
Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus), as well as a Pan Candida assay, which is
designed to detect four Candida species: Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei,
and Candida parapsilosis.
The detection and identification of specific bacterial and fungal nucleic acids from individuals
exhibiting signs and/or symptoms of bloodstream infection aids in the diagnosis of bloodstream
infection when used in conjunction with other clinical information. The results from the ePlex
BCID-GN Panel are intended to be interpreted in conjunction with Gram stain results and should
not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.
Negative results in the setting of a suspected bloodstream infection may be due to infection with
pathogens that are not detected by this test. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with
other organisms; the organism(s) detected by the ePlex BCID-GN Panel may not be the definite
cause of disease. Additional laboratory testing (e.g. sub-culturing of positive blood cultures for
identification of organisms not detected by ePlex BCID-GN Panel and for susceptibility testing,
differentiation of mixed growth, and association of antimicrobial resistance marker genes to a
specific organism) and clinical presentation must be taken into consideration in the final
diagnosis of bloodstream infection.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
See K182619 for additional details. The ePlex Blood Culture Identification Gram-Negative
(BCID-GN) Panel is designed for use with the GenMark ePlex Instrument. The original BCID-
GN Panel was cleared for identification of microorganisms and resistance markers from positive
blood cultures in K182619. The modified BCID-GN panel adds primers and/or probes to
improve inclusivity of four assays in the original panel: E.coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Citrobacter and Enterococcus. The Panel is contained on a consumable cartridge which consists
of a printed circuit board (PCB) surface electrodes. This single use cartridge incorporates digital
microfluidics and eSensor technology to automate all assay steps. The cartridge chamber
contains immiscible fluid to facilitate sample transport and contains reagent droplets for sample
processing.
Nucleic acid extraction from whole blood samples occurs within the cartridge via cell lysis,
nucleic acid capture onto magnetic beads, and release for amplification. The nucleic acid
extraction is processed through microfluidic liquid handling. Once the nucleic acid targets are
captured and inhibitors are washed away, the magnetic particles are delivered to the
electrowetting environment on the PCB and the targets are eluted from the particles and
amplified by RT-PCR.
K213236 - Page 3 of 14

--- Page 4 ---
After amplification, the double-stranded PCR amplicons are digested with exonuclease to
generate single-stranded DNA suitable for hybridization. During hybridization, the single-
stranded target DNA binds to a complementary, single-stranded capture probe immobilized on
the working gold electrode surface. Single-stranded signal probes (labeled with
electrochemically active ferrocenes) bind to specific target sequence / region adjacent to the
capture probe. Simultaneous hybridization of target to signal probes and capture probe is
detected by alternating current voltammetry (ACV). Each working electrode on the array
contains specific capture probes, and sequential analysis of each electrode allows detection of
multiple analyte targets.
A summary of microorganisms and resistance markers detected by the ePlex BCID-GN Panel are
presented in Table 1:

use ePlex cartridge, no further operator intervention is necessary, and the following automated
procedures occur inside the cartridge. Nucleic acids are extracted and purified via magnetic solid
phase extraction. For each of the BCID-GN Panel analytes, there are one or more forward or
reverse primer pairs. PCR amplification of DNA targets occurs in eight reaction mixes or drops.
After amplification double stranded DNA is digested with lambda exonuclease to generate single
stranded DNA, to which ferrocene-labeled signal probes and gold electrode-bound capture
probes hybridize. The presence of each target is determined by voltammetry which generates
specific electrical signals from ferrocene-labeled signal probe which is measured by gold
electrodes. Sequential analysis of each electrode allows detection of multiple analyte targets. The
ePlex Instrument measures and interprets this electrical output to determine the results for each
target on the BCID-GN Panel (Detected or Not Detected).

Analytical specificity of all oligonucleotides in the original ePlex BCID-GN Panel was
evaluated previously (refer to K182619). An in silico analysis was conducted to evaluate off-
panel and on-panel targets for potential cross-reactivity with the newly added primers/probes.
A BLASTN search for the amplicon sequence matching newly added primers and/or probes
while filtering out the correctly identified species (P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Citrobacter or
Enterococcus) was performed. Results for organisms that are predicted to generate false
positive results with the ePlex BCID-GN Panel are presented in Table 2.

5. Detection Limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) for each target on the ePlex BCID-GN Panel was determined
previously (refer to K182619).
For the new target strains that were not tested with the original panel (E.coli JHU01-
D80401147, P. aeruginosa SDx071, H. influenzae ATCC33930, and N. meningitidis
NCTC10026), LoD was determined using samples prepared in negative blood culture matrix
and tested with the ePlex BCID-GN Panel. Organisms were pooled together and serially
diluted to create 11 organism mixes containing two organisms in negative blood culture
matrix. At least ten replicates were tested at four dilutions and the lowest concentration that
resulted in ≥95% detection was selected as the estimated LoD. A minimum of 20 replicates
per organism mix were tested to confirm the final LoD for each assay target. The limit of
detection was defined as the lowest concentration at which each target is detected at least
95% of the time. Results from the study demonstrated that all targets were detected in ≥ 95%
of tested replicates at ≤1 x 108 CFU/mL (see Table 3).

P. aeruginosa SDx071 1 x 105
Additional wet testing was conducted to assess the impact of the newly incorporated primers
and probes on the LoD for the organism targets on the BCID-GN Panel. LoD verification
testing was conducted to evaluate the original organism targets of the modified PCR mixes:
Citrobacter sp., E. coli, P. mirabilis, A. baumannii, Serratia sp., Enterococcus sp., P.
aeruginosa, H. influenzae, N. meningitidis, M. morganii, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis. Panel
targets were tested in twenty replicates each of at least two different strains per target
organisms at the LoD concentration (CFU/mL) previously determined for the BCID-GN
panel (refer to K182619). Two strains from the original study were not available for
verification of LoD and were replaced with new strains: H. influenzae ATCC33930
(replacing ATCC19418 evaluated with the original BCID-GN panel), N. meningitidis
NCTC10026 (replacing ATCC13102 evaluated with the original BCID-GN panel). All
organisms were detected in ≥ 95% of tested replicates at ≤1 x 108 CFU/mL with the modified
panel. The results are shown in Table 4.

*LoD established for additional target strains using a range finding study and confirmation of detection ≥95% of the
time.
Additional evaluations were performed to demonstrate that the incorporation of the
oligonucleotides in two PCR reaction mixes do not adversely impact the performance of the
assay targets in other PCR mixes on the BCID-GN. Specifically, performance was assessed
for several targets using a multianalyte test mix that contained one representative target from
each of the eight multiplex PCR mixes in the previously cleared BCID-GN panel. At least 20
replicates per target were tested at the following three concentrations: HIGH (target levels
10X above LoD), MED (target levels near the LoD) and LOW (target levels 10X below the
LoD).
The study acceptance criteria were as follows: detection of ≥95% replicates at HIGH and
MED concentrations and detection of ≤95% replicates at the LOW concentration. Results
from the study are shown in Table 5.

the bottle positive concentration and LoD concentration. Therefore, the same concentration was used for the HIGH
and MED levels for this organism.
Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity:
Inclusivity of all oligonucleotides in the original BCID-GN Panel was evaluated previously
(refer to K182619). The performance of the modified ePlex BCID-GN Panel for the detection
of strains targeted by the modified PCR mixes was evaluated in a clinical agreement study to
support inclusivity. The study included testing with multiple unique clinical specimens and
contrived specimens prepared from unique isolates targeted by the PCR mixes that were
modified by the addition of new oligonucleotides. A total of 122 clinical samples collected
from multiple sites and 138 individually contrived blood culture bottles were used. A
minimum of ten unique clinical patient samples or strains were tested per target, with the
exception of Neisseria and H. influenzae for which six and eight samples were evaluated,
respectively. The results showed acceptable positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative
percent agreement (NPA) of 95% or more for all targets. These results support the inclusivity
of the modified panel. See Table 7 below.

New oligonucleotides were added to PCR reaction mixes that include the following organism
targets: Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae,
Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Neisseria meningitidis, Proteus mirabilis,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia, Pan-Gram positive Enterococcus faecalis, and Pan-Gram
positive Enterococcus. The new oligonucleotides were added to detect additional strains of E.
coli (JHU01-D80401147) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (SDx071) and to increase detection
of Citrobacter and Enterococcus strains.
Additional testing was conducted to demonstrate that the modified ePlex BCID-GN Panel
detects the targeted strains not detected by the original ePlex BCID-GN Panel and to verify
that the clinical performance of the modified ePlex BCID-GN Panel for other organism
targets is not adversely impacted by the introduction of the additional oligonucleotides. The
performance of the modified device was evaluated by testing a total of 20 samples for each
organism target that included a combination of unique clinical specimens and contrived
blood culture specimens as indicated in Table 6 and Table 7. The identity of strain E. coli
JHU01-D80401147 was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The other organism targets
evaluated in the study were obtained from previously collected frozen samples. Equivalence
between fresh and frozen specimens on the ePlex BCID-GN Panel was previously
established in K182619.
Contrived specimens were prepared by independently inoculating low concentrations of
organism into blood culture bottles and incubating on a continuously monitoring blood
culture system until the bottle was identified as positive. The inoculated concentrations
(CFU/mL) were at least four logs below the load observed at bottle positivity. The strains
used to prepare contrived specimens are shown in Table 6.

Overall, two hundred forty negative clinical samples were tested for NPA determination.
These samples were collected previously as part of the clinical agreement study for the
original device (refer to K182619 for details).
A summary of the modified ePlex BCID-GN Panel performance for each organism target for
clinical and contrived specimens is shown in Table 7. Performance is based on comparison of
ePlex BCID-GN Panel results to results from comparator methods for clinical specimens and
based on comparison of ePlex BCID-GN Panel results to the expected result for contrived
specimens.
