IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
VITEK 2 AST-YS Fluconazole has the following concentrations in the card: 2, 4, 8, 16,
32, and 64 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL).
The MIC result range for VITEK 2 AST-YS Fluconazole on the VITEK 2 card for is
≤0.5 – ≥64 μg/mL. For all species, the MIC result range indicates that the VITEK 2 system is
capable of producing the following MIC results ≤0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ≥64 μg/mL for AST-YS
Fluconazole test. This means the VITEK 2 systems does not provide results lower than 0.5
μg/mL or greater than 64 μg/mL for the AST-YS Fluconazole test.
The MIC interpretive criteria and equivalent concentrations are as follows:

Fluconazole 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64
≤ 2 4 ≥ 8
B Principle of Operation:
The principle of the VITEK 2 AST cards is based on the microdilution minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) technique reported by MacLowry and Marsh and
Gerlach. The VITEK 2 AST card is essentially a miniaturized, abbreviated and
automated version of the doubling dilution technique.
Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well which only contains
microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain
premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture media. The bacterial
or yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45 – 0.5%
saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader.
The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The
VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of
time. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the
MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the
card.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were performed using the ten isolate study design in triplicate at three
external clinical sites on three separate days. The studies included both the automated and
manual dilution methods with the VITEK 2 instrument system and the manual dilution
method with the VITEK 2 Compact instrument system. Greater than 95% reproducibility was
demonstrated with both the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems. There are no
concerns.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Inoculum Density Check: Inoculum density control was monitored using the DensiCHEK
Plus instrument.
Purity Check: Verification of isolate purity was conducted on all clinical, challenge and
reproducibility organism suspensions.
Growth or Device Failure: The VITEK 2 AST-YS Fluconazole trial had several device
failures including isolated mechanical failures that did not repeat (host communication error,
mechanical jam, failure to eject, and an optics failure) and user errors. These errors did not
raise concerns since they were isolated and did not reflect systematic issues.
Quality Control Testing: The CLSI recommended QC strains Candida krusei (ATCC 6258)
and Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) were tested a minimum of 20 times at each site by
the reference method, the VITEK 2 instrument platform using both auto- and manual dilution

methods, and the VITEK 2 Compact instrument platform using the manual dilution method.
A summary of the QC performance is provided in Table 1.
The quality control results for the VITEK 2 AST-YS Fluconazole were within the
recommended range ≥95% which is acceptable.

The performance of the VITEK 2 System was established for Candida spp. based on a
previously conducted clinical study at three external sites and one internal site. Performance
data for the three claimed Candida species was reanalyzed using updated STIC breakpoint
criteria for 367 clinical isolates and 64 challenge isolates of C. candida, C. parapsilosis, and
C. tropicalis that were previously tested. Due to the updated STIC recognized organisms for
Fluconazole, the challenge isolates fell to 64 isolates from the previous submission. To
compensate for the lack of challenge isolates and meet FDAs recommended criteria of 75

challenge organisms, the sponsor tested 11 new C. albicans challenge isolates and combined
the analysis with the reanalyzed clinical and challenge data. All comparisons were made to
the 24-hour broth microdilution reference method as described in CLSI documents M27-A3
and M27-S4. The clinical isolate specimens were composed of 282 (76.8%) fresh and 85
(23.2%) stock samples. Both automated and manual dilution methods were tested on the
VITEK 2 System. Challenge isolates were also tested with the manual dilution method on the
VITEK 2 Compact.
Essential agreement (EA) was calculated for when the VITEK 2 system results were within
+/- two doubling dilutions of the reference method results. Evaluable results were defined as
when both the reference method results and the VITEK 2 system results were on-scale.
Evaluable results were also defined as when the reference method results were on-scale
and off-scale VITEK 2 system results clearly did not agree within the accepted
+/- two doubling dilutions. Category agreement was calculated for when the VITEK 2 system
result interpretations agreed exactly with the reference method result qualitative
interpretations. Results are summarized in Table 2 below.

“An overall essential agreement rate of 99.1% and an overall category agreement rate of
94.5% were observed for Candida parapsilosis when tested with VITEK 2 Fluconazole.
Compared to the reference broth microdilution, two of 14 results for Candida
parapsilosis (one of which was in essential agreement) resulted in very major errors.”
The sponsor added a limitation in their labeling addressing the major errors observed for C.
tropicalis:
“Perform an alternative method of testing prior to reporting of results when a resistant
result is obtained with the following antibiotic/organism combination(s):
• Fluconazole (flu02n): Candida tropicalis”
MIC Trends:
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data. This
trending calculation considers MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling
dilutions lower or higher compared to the reference method irrespective of whether the
device MIC values are on-scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower,
at least one dilution higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not
considered in the trending analysis.
Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs. lower
MIC reading was ≥ 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined to be
statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that provides
higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in labeling.
A trend toward lower MIC readings was observed for all C. albicans, C parapsilosis, and C.
tropicalis when compared to the CLSI broth microdilution reference method, as summarized
in Table 3. The following statement is included as a footnote to the performance table in the
device labeling to address the observed trending:
“VITEK 2 Fluconazole MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one doubling
dilution higher when testing C. albicans, C parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis compared to the
broth microdilution reference method.”

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the BioMerieux VITEK2 AST-Yeast Fluconazole (≤0.5 - ≥64 µg/mL)
when revised breakpoints for Fluconazole are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The
breakpoint change protocol included with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are
met, BioMerieux will update the Fluconazole device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2)
an updated performance section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the
new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
