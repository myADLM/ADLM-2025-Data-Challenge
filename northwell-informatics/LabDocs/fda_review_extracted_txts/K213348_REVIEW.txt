deficient for the protein. The presence of staining elicited by the primary antibody in an internal positive
tissue control indicates the following:
1. The tissue of the patient specimen has been subjected to suitable processing and fixation to allow the
epitope of the target protein to be detected via IHC.
2. The staining procedure has been performed correctly on the slide mounted with the patient specimen.
3. The primary antibody is performing as intended and staining the corresponding protein.
Negative Reagent Control: For each patient specimen, a negative reagent control must be used to stain an
additional slide-mounted tissue section to that stained with the primary antibody. This will determine
whether the primary antibody is reacting with the patient tissue in a non-specific manner. BOND Ready-
to-Use Negative Control Negative (Mouse) is recommended as the negative reagent control for use in
conjunction with MLH1 (Mismatch Repair Protein) (ES05) and MSH2 (Mismatch Repair Protein)
(79H11). BOND Ready-to-Use Negative Control Negative (Rabbit) is recommended as the negative
reagent control for use in conjunction with MSH6 (Mismatch Repair Protein) (EP49) and PMS2
(Mismatch Repair Protein) (EP51).
Instrumentation and Software:
The BOND MMR Antibody Panel is intended for use on the BOND-III or BOND-MAX fully automated
systems. The BOND-MAX and BOND-III instruments are fully automated slide stainers that perform
automated deparaffinization (dewaxing), antigen retrieval, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining/in situ
hybridization (ISH) staining, and counterstaining. The major components of the BOND staining
platforms are the processing module, computer (BOND controller), handheld ID scanner, and slide label
printer. The BOND staining platforms are composed of a number of discrete software components
including the BOND application software, BOND instrument/processing module software, BOND
service software, and Laboratory interface system - integration package (LIS-IP).
L. Test Principle:
Immunohistochemical techniques can be used to demonstrate the presence of antigens in tissue and cells.
MLH1 (Mismatch Repair Protein) (ES05), MSH2 (Mismatch Repair Protein) (79H11), MSH6 (Mismatch
Repair Protein) (EP49) and PMS2 (Mismatch Repair Protein) (EP51) primary antibodies are Ready-to-
Use products that have been specifically optimized for use on the automated BOND-MAX or BOND-III
systems in combination with BOND Polymer Refine Detection.
The BOND Polymer Refine Detection Process is as follows:
• The specimen is incubated with hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
• The BOND Ready- to-Use Primary Antibody is applied.
• A post primary antibody solution enhances penetration of the subsequent polymer reagent.
• A poly-HRP anti-mouse/rabbit IgG reagent localizes the primary antibody.
• The substrate chromogen, 3,3’- diaminobenzidine (DAB), visualizes the complex via a brown
precipitate.
• Hematoxylin (blue) counterstaining allows the visualization of cell nuclei.
M. Interpretation of Results
Hematoxylin and Eosin stained slides are used to assess the overall quality of the sample for each case.
An assessment should be made of the quality and quantity of the tumor content of the CRC sample. Cases
should be voided if there is insufficient tumor (less than 50 viable tumor cells) available to score or if the
sample is poorly fixed or otherwise of a poor enough quality that renders interpretation of the case
impossible. The MMR protein status for each IHC marker shall be assigned following the decisi4o n

summary illustrated in the flowchart below.
*Any staining seen in the Negative Isotype Controls should be taken into account when interpreting the MMR antibody stained test sections.
If any staining is judged to be of sufficient intensity to adversely affect the interpretation of the test sections then this should be classed as
unacceptable and the case voided.
** Weaker than internal positive control cells
To obtain the BOND MMR Antibody Panel results, each individual marker (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and
PMS2) will be scored as protein loss or protein intact according to the device’s prespecified scoring
criteria. The loss of one or more of these proteins within one specimen will be considered an MMR loss.
5
To obtain an intact panel result, all four proteins must be scored as intact.

VII Performance Characteristics:
Q. Analytical performance
a. Precision
Three studies were performed to evaluate the precision of the BOND MMR Antibody Panel.
i. Precision across Lots and Days on the BOND-III and BOND-MAX Instruments
This study was conducted at 1 site using 3 lots of BOND Ready To Use MMR Primary Antibody for
each of the 4 MMR proteins. Slides from 40 FFPE CRC tissue cases, 10 cases per MMR protein, with
5 cases being protein deficient and 5 cases expressing intact protein were tested. Each case was
stained 18 times [3 Slide Staining Assembly (SSAs) x 6 days] on 1 BOND-III and 1 BOND-MAX
instrument. Testing was performed over 6 nonconsecutive days following a randomized testing order.
Therefore, a total of 1440 slides (4 antibodies x 10 samples x 3 SSAs x 2 instruments x 6 days) were
evaluated. A single pathologist read and scored all stained slides.
Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA) and overall percent agreement
(OPA) were calculated, comparing the antibody status of each processed slide determined by the
pathologist to the majority score. Point estimates along with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals were
calculated separately by instrument and by antibody. All slides from one case for MSH2 staining
were excluded from BOND-III data analysis (n = 18) and from BOND-MAX data analysis (n = 18)
because the case had insufficient tumor.
Intra-run Repeatability:
Intra-run repeatability was evaluated using 40 FFPE CRC tissue cases, 10 cases per MMR protein,
with 5 cases being protein deficient (protein loss) and 5 cases expressing intact protein (intact). Six
(6) slides were stained using each panel antibody. Data were obtained using 1 lot of each panel
antibody from 60 total observations (10 cases x 3 replicates x 2 days x 1 instrument) for each panel
antibody on BOND-III and from 60 total observations (10 cases x 3 replicates x 2 days x 1
instrument) for each panel antibody on BOND-MAX. Intra-run repeatability OPA was 100% for each
panel antibody on both instruments except MSH2 on BOND-III (OPA 98.1%, PPA 100%, NPA
95.8%) and PMS2 on BOND-MAX (OPA 98.3%, PPA 100%, NPA 96.7%). Results for individual
panel antibodies are shown in Table 1 below.

Between-lot Precision:
The study evaluated lot to lot repeatability with 3 final lots of each of the 4 panel antibodies using the
same CRC cases as intra-run testing. Three (3) slides per case were stained using each panel antibody
across 6 non-consecutive days (2 days per lot) on BOND-III and BOND-MAX. Data were obtained
from 180 total observations (10 cases x 3 replicates x 2 days x 3 lots) for each panel antibody on
BOND-III and from 180 total observations (10 cases x 3 replicates x 2 days x 3 lots) for each panel
antibody on BOND-MAX. [Note: MSH2 evaluation was conducted with 4 intact and 5 loss s9t atus

The results support that the BOND MMR Antibody Panel on BOND-III and on BOND-MAX have
acceptable levels of precision (repeatability) across lots and days.
ii. Reproducibility across Laboratories and Pathologists on the BOND-III and BOND-MAX
Instruments
This study was conducted at 3 sites using 1 lot of the BOND MMR antibody for each of the 4 MMR
proteins. Slides from 30 FFPE CRC tissue cases were tested, including cases being protein deficient
and cases expressing intact proteins. Each case was stained on 1 BOND-III and 1 BOND MAX
instrument per site, for a total of 6 times (3 sites x 2 instruments). Testing was performed on 6 non-
consecutive days over a minimum 20-day testing period, following randomized testing orders. A
single pathologist per site read and scored all stained slides from that site. In addition, 3 pathologists
read and scored a set of 30 cases stained at 1 site in 3 scoring sessions separated by a washout period
of at least 14 days.

PPA, NPA and OPA were calculated for point estimates along with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals
to evaluate intra-pathologist, inter-pathologist, inter-laboratory and inter-instrument precision.
Results of the study are summarized in Tables 5 to 8. The results support that the BOND MMR
Antibody Panel on BOND-III and on BOND-MAX have acceptable levels of precision
(reproducibility).
Intra- and Inter-Pathologist Reproducibility:
Intra-pathologist and inter-pathologist reproducibility were assessed by evaluating concordance of
marker status across 3 pathologists and within individual pathologists using 30 cases of CRC stained
at 1 site on BOND-III and BOND-MAX. These 30 CRC specimens consisted of varying number of
cases with loss or intact MMR protein status as shown in Table 4. Each reader scored all 30 cases in
three rounds that were separated by a two week wash out period. Data was obtained from 270 total
observations (30 cases x 3 replicate x 3 pathologists) for each of the 4 panel antibodies for BOND-III,
and from 270 total observations (30 cases x 3 replicate x 3 pathologists) for each panel antibody for
BOND-MAX. Intra-pathologist reproducibility OPA ranged from 99.3% to 100%, PPA ranged from
99.2% to 100%. The results are shown below in Table 5. Inter-pathologist reproducibility OPA
ranged from 99.3% to 100%, PPA ranged from 99.2% to 100%. The results are shown below in Table
6. The studies met the pre-specified acceptance criteria.

Inter-Instrument Reproducibility:
Instrument to instrument reproducibility was evaluated by one pathologist using the same cases as
Inter-pathologist and Intra-pathologist reproducibility. One slide was stained using each of the 4 panel
antibodies, one slide was stained with Negative Control (Mouse), and one slide was stained with
Negative Control (Rabbit) for each case across 3 different BOND-III and 3 different BOND-MAX
instruments. Data was obtained from 90 total observations (30 cases x 1 replicate x 3 instruments) for

Inter-laboratory Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the BOND MMR Antibody Panel was assessed at 3 sites using the same cases
as Inter-pathologist and Intra-pathologist reproducibility. Multiple tissue sections were cut from each
case. Three (3) sites (2 external and 1 internal) stained all cases with the designated antibody and the
appropriate negative reagent control (NRC) antibody spanning a period of at least 20 days. One
pathologist at each site independently evaluated each case to determine the status (intact or loss).
Data was obtained from 90 total observations (30 cases x 1 replicate x 3 sites) for each of the 4 panel
antibodies for BOND-III, and from 90 total observations (30 cases x 1 replicate x 3 sites) for each
panel antibody for BOND-MAX. Reproducibility OPA ranged from 98.9% to 100%, PPA ranged
from 98.8% to 100%. The study met pre-specified acceptance criteria. Results for the overall panel
and each panel antibody on BOND-III and BOND-MAX are shown in Table 8 below.

iii. Reproducibility across Days and Laboratories on BOND-III
To evaluate the inter-day and inter-site reproducibility of the BOND MMR Antibody Panel on the
BOND-III Instrument, 24 FFPE CRC tissue cases were tested, including 3 intact and 3 loss cases for
each of the 4 MMR proteins, at 3 testing sites. At each site, slides were stained with 1 reagent lot of
the antibodies using 1 BOND-III instrument. Two staining runs were performed each day to test slides
from the 24 cases on each of 5 nonconsecutive test days at each site. A total of 360 slides (6 cases × 4
antibodies × 3 sites × 5 days) were evaluated. At each site, one pathologist read and scored stained
slides stained at their site in accordance with the scoring guidance. The slides stained on the same day
were scored together in the same scoring session. Different scoring sessions occurred on
nonconsecutive days. 13

PPA, NPA and OPA were calculated for point estimates along with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals
by comparing the antibody status of each processed slide determined by the pathologist to the
majority score. The majority score was determined by combining runs across all sites. At one site, 12
slides failed due to temperature error. New unstained slides were repeat stained and read and scored
successfully.
Results of the study are summarized in Table 9 to Table 13. The overall reproducibility OPA ranged
from 94.4% to 100%, PPA ranged from 91.7% to 100%, NPA ranged from 97.8% to 100%. The
lower bound of the two-sided 95% Confidence Interval for OPA, PPA and NPA for each antibody are
≥ 85% with 1 exception. For MSH6, PPA was 91.7% (95% CI: 81.9% - 96.4%). All 5 discordant
results were from one case and 4 of the 5 slides were stained at a single site. This case was
investigated, and the study pathologists agreed that it was challenging to interpret due to the very
focal staining impacting scoring.
The results support that the BOND MMR Antibody Panel on BOND-III have acceptable levels of
precision (reproducibility) across days and testing sites.

antibody underwent transport simulation as preconditioning. The Transport Simulation Batches
were stored for a minimum of 24 hours at 2-8°C, the required aliquots were removed from
recommended storage conditions and transferred to 27-33°C for 2 days, then returned to
recommended storage conditions for at least 1 day, then transferred to 37-43°C for 2 days.
A Day 0 test was performed where a minimum of 3 cases were stained and a 0-4 scale used as
the reference. Day 0 slides were required to have a staining intensity of at least 2+ in the most
intensely-staining tumor region to be included in the study.
Accelerated Stability
Following transport cycling, the lot of the antibody was stored at 34-40 oC and at 24-30°C.
Timepoints for testing at 34-40 oC were 7 and 10 weeks; timepoints for testing at 24-30°C were
14 and 20 weeks. If a testing failure occurred at either timepoint for 34-40 oC then the study
reverted to testing units stored at 24-30°C. If units stored at 24-30°C failed then accelerated
stability was discontinued and real time data used. At each time point, staining intensities of the
slides were compared with the ones stained at Day 0. The intensity had to be at least 2+ for all
slides to pass the acceptance criteria.
Real Time Shelf-Life Tests
Real time stability was evaluated for three conditions: long term stability (Real-time Shelf Life
Test), in-use stability (In Use Test), transport simulation (Transport Test). The study was
continued up to 545 Days (18-month timepoint including a safety margin)
1. The in-use stability test batch was stored at 2-8oC until required for testing where an 'In
Use' aliquot of the antibody for each time points was cycled for 35 cycles by storing at
34-40°C for 7 hours. At the end of each 7 hour period containers were returned to 2-8°C.
The units were tested on or after 35 cycles.
2. The transport simulation batches were stored for a minimum of 24 hours at 2-8°C, the
required aliquots were removed from recommended storage conditions and transferred to
27-33°C for 2 days, then returned to recommended storage conditions for at least 1 day,
then transferred to 37-43°C for 2 days. Units were returned thereafter to their
recommended storage conditions for a period of at least 24 hours before testing.
3. The real time stability test for the three batches were performed on Day 0 and then
subsequent time points. Tissues stained at each time point were compared to a Day 0
control tissue and a -77 - -83°C control.
Freeze-Thaw Tests
The freeze-thaw batch underwent freeze-thaw preconditioning prior to day 0 testing. Three vials
of the batch were stored at -77 - -83°C for a minimum of 24 hours. The aliquots were then
placed at 2-8oC to thaw overnight and were tested alongside and compared to an aliquot stored
only at 2-8°C. The freeze-thaw batch was not subjected to transport simulation.
At each time point, staining intensities of the slides were compared with the ones stained at Day
0. The intensity was required to be at least 2+ for all slides to pass the acceptance criteria. If the
test failed, then study either reverted to the lower temperatures or in the case of a real time
failure the study would be aborted.
Results
All four antibodies passed the transport simulation testing and the freeze-thaw testing. The anti-
17

--- Page 18 ---
MLH1, anti-MSH2 and anti-PMS2 antibodies passed the accelerated stability testing at 7 and 10
weeks, supporting that the maximum shelf life for these antibodies is 12 months. Real time
stability studies have passed at 545 days. The antibody of anti-MSH6 passed the accelerated
stability testing at 7 weeks but failed at 10 weeks. The antibody also failed the 24-30oC
accelerated stability testing at 20 weeks. However, anti-MSH6 passed the real time stability
testing at 365 days, supporting that the maximum shelf life for this antibody is 7 months.
b) Cut slide Stability:
To evaluate the stability of the cut slides, 60 x 3µm sections were cut from each of three FFPE
CRC tissue cases for a total of 180 slides. Six slides of each FFPE CRC tissue case were stained
on Day 0 on the BOND-III system with one lot of each of the four antibodies along with the
negative reagent controls, scored on a 0-4+ scale and used as the reference. All three cases are
intact for all four MMR proteins with the staining intensity being at least 2+ in the most
intensely-staining tumor region. The remaining slides of each FFPE CRC tissue case were stored
at ambient/room temperature for 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 77 days. At each timepoint, six slides
of each FFPE CRC tissue case were stained the same way as above and compared with the ones
stained at baseline. In addition, at each of these timepoints, freshly cut sections of the same three
tissue cases were stained with each of the four antibodies as a quality control. The intensity was
required to be at least 2+ to pass the acceptance criteria. Results of the study showed that the
epitopes recognized by each of the four antibodies in FFPE CRC tissue cases remain stable for a
period of time up to and including 11 weeks post sectioning when the tissue sections are
mounted onto slides and stored at ambient/room temperature, therefore supporting epitope
stability claims in cut sections of up to 10 weeks.
d. Detection Limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity was addressed in two separate studies for each of the MMR panel antibodies.
The first addressed antibody specificity and the second addressed immunoreactivity in normal and
neoplastic tumor specimen.
i. Western Blot and IHC:
Western blot analyses were conducted to demonstrate that the antibodies specifically detect the
proteins of predicted molecular weight for each of the 4 BOND MMR antibodies using cell lines
with known MMR loss or intact status. Cell lines used in the study were generated using lysates
from the PANC-1 (human epithelial pancreas/duct carcinoma) for MLH1 and MSH2 and lysates
from the A431 (human epidermoid carcinoma) for MSH6 and PMS2. Western Blots confirmed
presence of reactive bands at expected molecular weighs for each of the 4 MMR proteins.
IHC tests were conducted using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell lines described in the
table below to assess nonspecific binding in the context of use. The results of the IHC with
engineered cell lines was consistent with expected reactivity.

The combined results from western blots and cell line IHC demonstrated specific antibody
reactivity for each of the 4 MMR proteins included in the BOND MMR antibody panel.
ii. Immunoreactivity:
Immunoreactivity of the BOND MMR antibodies was tested across multiple cases of normal and
tumor tissue types. The summary of staining results with the panel antibodies is shown in Table
14 to 16. Staining of these ubiquitously expressed nuclear proteins was observed in normal and
neoplastic tissues as expected.

S. Clinical Performance:
The clinical validity of the BOND MMR Antibody Panel was determined in a study that assessed
agreement between test results obtained from the BOND MMR Antibody Panel and a molecular test
based on a DNA sequencing panel validated for detecting presence of pathogenic mutations likely to
affect MMR protein expression in CRC. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the ability of the panel
to correctly aid in the identification of patients needing additional Lynch syndrome genetic testing.
Eligible remnant FFPE CRC tissues (“cases”) were procured, with at least 100 sequential cases with
unknown mismatch repair (MMR) status (also referred to as the Sequential cohort) and at least 48 cases
with known MMR protein deficiencies (also referred to as the Enrichment cohort). Specimens from the
two cohorts were combined, randomized and processed to create slides evaluation with BOND MMR
Antibody Panel testing and the DNA sequencing testing. Staining with the BOND MMR Antibody Panel
was performed on BOND-III system in accordance with the instructions for use (IFUs). One pathologist
at the testing site read and scored BOND MMR Antibody Panel stained slides in accordance with the
scoring guidance.
Inclusion Criteria:
• FFPE CRC tissue block with matched normal blood, saliva, or FFPE tissue and
• (Sequential cohort) With unknown MMR protein status, sequentially obtained from a single US
site or
• (Enrichment cohort) With known immunohistochemistry (IHC) MMR protein status obtained
from multiple sites, including:
MLH1 and PMS2 loss
o
MSH2 and MSH6 loss
o
isolated PMS2 loss
o
isolated MSH6 loss
o
Exclusion Criteria:
• Tissue requirements for comparator DNA sequencing panel were not met
• Lack of sufficient tumor.
There were 155 cases procured for the study. One case was excluded due to not meeting the Enrichment
cohort inclusion criteria. Of the remaining 154 cases eligible for the study, One case had insufficient
tumor for both DNA sequencing and BOND MMR Antibody Panel testing, three cases had insufficient
tumor for DNA sequencing, and seven cases did not have MMR Stained Slides interpreted due to the
H&E Slide showing less than 50 viable tumor cells present for evaluation, not meeting the tissue
requirements required by the BOND MMR Antibody Panel,. Therefore, of the 154 eligible cases, 143
were tested by both methods (94 sequential cases and 49 enriched cases). Assessment of the demographic
data associated with the study specimens determined that it was consistent with the intended use
population.

BOND MMR Antibody Panel results (MMR loss or MMR intact) were compared to the DNA sequencing
panel results for pathogenic mutation(s) in the combined cohort (Sequential and Enrichment cohorts), and
23
in the Sequential cohort and the Enrichment cohort, respectively. PPA, NPA, and OPA along with 2-

sided 95% Wilson score confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.
Of the 143 specimens tested by the BOND MMR Antibody Panel and the DNA sequencing panel, ten
(10) cases had invalid DNA sequencing panel results due to testing not meeting quality control standards
and were excluded from the agreement analysis. The remaining 133 of 143 cases had valid results by
both methods and were evaluable. Results of the study are summarized in Tables 17 to 19. The point
estimates of agreement between the BOND MMR Antibody Panel and the DNA sequencing panel in the
combined cohort were PPA 93.3%, NPA 95.9% and OPA 94.7%.

Accuracy by MMR proteins: The concordance for MMR gene mutation status by the DNA sequencing
panel and MMR protein loss by the BOND MMR Antibody Panel was also compared individually for
each antibody. When compared to the results to the DNA sequencing panel, the OPA of each MMR
protein ranged from 94.0% to 98.5%, the PPA ranged from 65.0% to 97.5%, the NPA ranged from 95.7%
to 99.2%. Results are summarized in Tables 20 to 22.
MLH1: Of the 37 MLH1 mutation positive cases, 33 had MLH1 protein loss when assessed by the
BOND MMR Antibody Panel. Of the 4 MLH1 mutation positive cases with discordant BOND MMR
Antibody results (i.e., intact), the following was found:
• One case had MLH1 promoter hypermethylation
• One case had a single somatic MLH1 pathogenic mutation with Copy-neutral loss of
heterozygosity (CN-LOH)
• One case had 2 MLH1 somatic mutations as well as MLH1 promoter hypermethylation
• One case had a single somatic MLH1 pathogenic mutation and microsatellite instability-high
(MSI-H) status.
Three of the cases also showed PMS2 protein loss.
MSH2: Of the 13 MSH2 mutation positive cases, 12 had MSH2 protein loss when assessed by the BOND
MMR Antibody Panel. A single MSH2 mutation positive case with discordant BOND MMR Antibody
results (i.e., intact) was identified. This case was characterized by a single MSH2 pathogenic mutation
combined with MSI-H status; an MSH2 Variant of Unknown Significance (VUS) was also identified.
MSH6 protein was also intact.
MSH6: Of the 20 MSH6 mutation positive cases, 13 had MSH6 protein loss when assessed by the BOND
MMR Antibody Panel. Of the 7 MSH6 mutation positive cases with discordant BOND MMR Antibody
results (ie, MSH6 intact), the cases were characterized as follows:
• A single MSH2 pathogenic mutation combined with MSI-H status; an MSH2 VUS was also
identified. MSH2 protein was preserved.
• One pathogenic variant of somatic origin in the MSH2 gene, MSI-H status and MSH2 protein
loss. 25

• Germline pathogenic mutation in MSH2 with CN-LOH and MSH2 protein loss, as well as a
single germline pathogenic mutation in PMS2 and a single somatic pathogenic mutation in
MSH6.
• A germline and a somatic mutation in MSH6 as well as multiple VUS.
• Two somatic mutations in MSH6 consistent with biallelic somatic mutations as well as a single
germline mutation in PMS2 with PMS2 protein loss.
• Two pathogenic variants of somatic origin in MSH6 gene, and one pathogenic mutation of
somatic mutation in MSH2, MSI-High status, and a PMS2 VUS was also identified.
• One pathogenic variant of somatic origin in MSH6 gene with MLH1 and PMS2 protein loss, as
well as MSI-High.
Of the 7 MSH6 mutation positive cases with discordant BOND MMR Antibody results (i.e. MSH6
intact), 4 demonstrated IHC loss when stained using the BOND MMRS Antibody Panel and these cases
should receive additional diagnostic testing consistent with clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis of
Lynch syndrome.
PMS2: Of the 40 PMS2 mutation positive cases, 39 had PMS2 protein loss when assessed by the BOND
MMR Antibody Panel. A single PMS2 mutation positive cases with discordant BOND MMR Antibody
results (i.e., intact) was identified. This case was characterized by a MLH1 promoter hypermethylation
combined with MSI-S status. MLH1 protein staining was also intact.
