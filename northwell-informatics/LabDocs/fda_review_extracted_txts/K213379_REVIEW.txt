III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Clearblue® Early Pregnancy Test is an over-the-counter chromatographic immunoassay for
the qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. This test is intended
for use as an aid in early detection of pregnancy, in some cases as early as six (6) days before the
day of the missed period, i.e. as early as five (5) days before the day of the expected period. The
test is intended for home use.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Clearblue® Early Pregnancy Test employs an immunochromatographic sandwich assay to
detect hCG on a lateral flow test strip. The result is displayed to the user in the test window as
two lines for a ‘Pregnant’ result and one line for a ‘Not Pregnant’ result. The lateral flow test
strip is housed in a cassette.
B Principle of Operation:
The Clearblue® Early Pregnancy test is a lateral flow sandwich immunoassay employing
monoclonal antibodies that are specifically directed against the alpha and beta sub-units of hCG.
After the application of urine, the test result is shown in the result window and is read visually
after 5 minutes. If hCG is present in the urine sample, it is bound by a conjugated monoclonal
anti beta-hCG antibody forming a visible red line indicating a Pregnant result (two lines must
appear within five minutes). A ‘Not Pregnant’ result will have a red line in the control window
and no line in the results window. The device also includes a follicle stimulating hormone
(FSH)-mediated scavenger zone. This may reduce the risk of false positive results in a small
number of women who have low levels of hCG in urine but are not pregnant.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A pooled negative female urine sample was spiked with hCG (traceable to the 4th WHO
International Standard (IS) for hCG) to obtain eight urine samples with hCG concentrations
of <1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 mIU/mL. One hundred and thirty-five (135) devices were
tested per hCG concentration by three technicians, on five non-consecutive days (spread over
11 days), using the two methods of sampling (dip and simulated in-stream) and 3 lots of the
device. On each test day, 3 technicians tested 3 devices each per lot, per hCG concentration,
per sampling method. A total of 2160 Clearblue® Early Pregnancy Test devices were tested
(3 technicians x 3 replicates x 3 lots x 5 days x 8 hCG concentrations x 2 sampling methods).
The results are summarized in the tables below.

The sponsor also provided information to show no significant differences in performance
between device lots.
2. Linearity:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Urine specimens from non-pregnant females were pooled and used to prepare samples with
hCG levels <1 mIU/mL and 10 mIU/mL that were then spiked with the potentially interfering
exogenous and endogenous substances. Control samples containing no test substance were
also tested to compare to the test samples. Each condition was tested in five replicates on
three lots (for a total n of 15) for each of the two hCG concentrations using the dip method.
No interference effect was observed at the tested concentrations shown in the table below.

Cross-reactivity of structurally related compounds:
The candidate device was evaluated for potential cross-reactivity from FSH, luteinizing
hormone (LH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Urine pools negative for hCG were
used to prepare samples with hCG concentrations <1 mIU/mL, 4 mIU/mL and 10 mIU/mL.
These samples were spiked with the potential cross reactants at the concentrations described
in the table below and tested using 5 devices from each of 3 lots per testing condition (n of
15 per test condition). The results show that all the devices tested returned the expected
result.

A study was performed to evaluate the number of false positive test results obtained using the
Clearblue® Early Digital Pregnancy Test. Urine samples were collected from 150 women
from each of four cohorts: non-pregnant pre-menopausal women between the ages of 18-40,
non-pregnant peri-menopausal women between the ages of 41-55, post-menopausal women >
55 years of age, and 51 pregnant women. Urine samples were collected from individual
women from each cohort and were tested by technicians with three lots of the candidate
device using both sampling methods (dip and simulated in-stream). The results are
summarized in the tables below.
