IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent consists of 10 multiplexed immunoassays that utilize
particle-based multi-analyte technology (PMAT) in a cartridge format. Each Aptiva CTD
Essential reagent kit contains the following reagents for 250 determinations:
• dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro60, Ro52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere, Ribo-P and Control
paramagnetic particles, preserved.
• Assay Buffer – colored pink, containing protein stabilizers and preservatives.
• PE Tracer IgG – PE labeled anti-human IgG antibody, containing buffer, protein
stabilizers and preservative.
• Rehydration Buffer - containing protein stabilizers and preservatives.
K213403 - Page 3 of 46

--- Page 4 ---
The Aptiva CTD Essential Calibrators and Aptiva CTD Essential Controls are sold separately.
• The Aptiva CTD Essential Calibrators includes six calibrators. The calibrators contain
human antibodies to dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro60, Ro52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere,
and Ribo-P in stabilizers and preservatives.
• The Aptiva CTD Essential Controls includes two controls. The controls contain human
antibodies to dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro60, Ro52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere, and Ribo-
P in stabilizers and preservatives.
B Principle of Operation:
The Aptiva CTD Essential reagent utilizes particle based multi-analyte technology (PMAT). Ten
unique populations of microparticles coated with dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro60, Ro52, SS-B, Scl-70,
Jo- 1, Centromere or Ribo-P autoantigens, along with one for the control microparticle, are
stored in the reagent cartridge under conditions that preserve the autoantigens in their reactive
states. When the assay cartridge is ready to be used, the reagent tube seals are pierced, and the
reagent cartridge is then loaded onto the Aptiva Multi-Analyte Instrument.
The Aptiva System dilutes the patient sample 1:44.4 fold with Aptiva system rinse by the
instrument in a disposable cuvette and a small amount of the diluted sample is combined with
reagent into a second cuvette. The mixture is incubated at 37°C. After a series of wash cycles,
phycoerythrin-conjugated polyclonal anti-human IgG (known as PE Tracer IgG) is added to the
particles and this mixture is incubated at 37°C. Excess conjugate is removed in another wash
cycle, and the particles are re-suspended in Aptiva system fluid.
Following the wash steps, the microparticles are transferred to the optical module of the
instrument, where a charge coupled device (CCD) camera takes multiple images to identify and
count the microparticle regions and determine the amount of conjugate on the microparticles. A
control microparticle coated with goat anti-human IgG is present in the reagent as a control to
flag low concentrations of IgG in the patient serum sample as an assay verification step. The
median fluorescent intensity (MFI) is proportional to the amount of PE tracer that is bound to the
human IgG, which is proportional to the amount of IgG antibodies bound to the corresponding
microparticle regions.
For quantitation, each of the 10 assays in the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent utilizes a predefined
lot specific master curve that is uploaded onto the instrument through the RFID tag on the
reagent cartridge. The first time a reagent cartridge of a new lot of Aptiva CTD Essential is
placed in the instrument, it must be calibrated. The calibration process utilizes the six calibrators
that are included in the calibrators kit to adjust the predefined lot specific dsDNA, RNP, Sm,
Ro60, Ro52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere and Ribo-P master curves into instrument specific
working curves. These working curves are used to calculate Fluorescent Light Units (FLU) or
IU/mL for dsDNA values from the measured MFI. The working curves are lot and instrument
specific and stored in the system for use with any reagent cartridge from that lot.
Based on the defined cut-off value for each analyte, the test results are reported for each sample
as “positive” or “negative” with a test value in FLU for the semi-quantitative assays or in IU/mL
for quantitative dsDNA assay.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision and reproducibility of the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent were evaluated in
accordance with the CLSI guideline EP05-A3.
Within-Laboratory Precision:
To evaluate within-laboratory precision of the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent, a variable
number of samples containing various concentrations of antibodies were assayed in
duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days, for a total of 80 measurements per sample, using one
reagent lot at one laboratory site, by one operator.
The resulting data was analyzed using Analyze-it for Excel software by analysis of variance
(ANOVA) methods and the within-run (repeatability), between-run, between-day, and
within-laboratory precision were determined. As the number of samples and the values of
measurand assayed varies by analyte, the study results are summarized on a per-analyte basis
below:

The reproducibility of the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent was conducted at three sites using a
variable number of samples containing various concentrations of antibodies. Samples were
assayed in quintuplicate, once a day, for five days to generate 25 data points per sample per
site using one reagent lot and a total of 75 replicates per sample. Instrument and operator
variables were nested within the multiple site component – i.e., a different operator and
instrument was used at each of the three sites.
The resulting data was analyzed using Analyze-it for Excel software by ANOVA methods
and precision between sites was determined. As the number of samples assayed varies by
analyte, the results are summarized on a per analyte basis below.

Lot-to-lot imprecision:
To evaluate the between-lot imprecision of the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent, a variable
number of samples containing various concentrations of antibodies were assayed in
quintuplicate, once a day, for 5 days, using three reagent lots, using one instrument, for a
total of 75 replicates per sample.
The resulting data was analyzed using Analyze-it for Excel software by ANOVA methods
and precision between lots was determined. As the number of samples assayed varies by
analyte, the results are summarized on a per analyte basis below:

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the analytical measuring range was calculated separately for each of the
Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent analytes (dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro60, Ro52, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1,
Ribo-P and Centromere).
The linearity for all analytes was evaluated by a study following CLSI EP06-Ed2. Various
samples were prepared as overlapping dilution series by mixing human serum samples with
high antibody concentrations and samples with low antibody concentrations to cover portions
of the analytical measuring interval (AMI) of each analyte. Each sample was tested in
duplicate and the results from each sample were analyzed separately using a weighted least
squares regression analysis.
The percent deviation from the weighted least squares regression analysis was used to assess
the fit of the regression for each sample and each analyte. For values on the low end of the
measuring interval, absolute deviations were used in lieu of the percentage. The results are
summarized on a per analyte basis below.

analytical measuring range by performing a 10-fold dilution to bring the measured value to
within the AMI, followed by a software calculation to account for the additional 10-fold
dilution. To validate the auto-rerun function with 1:10 dilutions, two positive samples for
each analyte, with concentrations well above the assay measuring range, were run with the
auto-rerun function enabled on the Aptiva Instrument. The same set of samples were
manually diluted 1:10, tested, and used as reference values. A percent recovery comparison
of the values obtained by the auto-rerun and the manual dilution was conducted to determine
the highest Auto-rerun values.
The highest value that is ≤15% of the manual concentration for each measurand is listed in
the table below:

Interference:
An interference study was performed based on the recommendations contained in CLSI
EP07-A2. A set of three human serum specimens − one positive specimen, one specimen
near the cutoff, and one negative specimen, were assessed as vehicle-control or interferent-
spiked contrived specimens in triplicate using the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent assays
(dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro52, Ro60, SS-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere and Ribo-P). The percent
recovery for each sample that was spiked with the potential interfering substance was
calculated by comparing its result to that of the corresponding control sample without the
interfering substance.
Endogenous:
The following endogenous interferents were tested: bilirubin, hemoglobin, triglycerides,
cholesterol, rheumatoid factor IgM and human IgG. The Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent
showed <±15% recovery with bilirubin up to 1 mg/mL, hemoglobin up to 2 mg/mL,
triglyceride up to 1000 mg/dL, cholesterol up to 332.5 mg/dL, RF IgM up to 153.4 IU/mL
and human IgG up to 35 mg/mL.
Exogenous:
The following exogenous interferents were tested: ibuprofen, acetaminophen, prednisone,
warfarin, diltiazem, azathioprine, sildenafil, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and
heparin. The Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent showed <±15% recovery up to 21.9 mg/dL
ibuprofen, 15.6 mg/dL acetaminophen, 0.0099 mg/dL prednisone, 7.5 mg/dL warfarin, 0.09
mg/dL diltiazem, 0.258 mg/dL azathioprine, 0.271 mg/dL sildenafil, 54.9 mg/dL
cyclophosphamide, 1.125 mg/mL mycophenolate mofetil and 330 units/dL heparin.
Rituximab was not evaluated for interference with the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent.

Assay Analytical Measuring Interval (AMI)
dsDNA 2.3 – 814.10 IU/mL
RNP 0.50 – 181.99 FLU
Sm 0.25 – 256.00 FLU

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
For Aptiva dsDNA, the Master Curve Standards are traceable to the First International
Standard Preparation (WHO code: Wo/80). Based upon this standardization, results are
reported in International Units (IU)/mL. There are no international reference standards for
the other analytes that allow the standardization of the assays. Calibrator and control values
are directly traceable to in-house reference materials that are used to create the master curves
for the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent.
No international reference serum panel for anti-ANA antibodies is available that allows for
the standardization of anti-ANA antibody assays.
Sample Stability
To determine the stability of patient samples, three samples were tested for each analyte in
the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent assay. The samples used in the study were contrived by
combining native high and low measurand (auto-antibody) serum samples to yield a desired
reactivity. The samples were assayed in duplicate for up to 21 days while stored at 2-8°C, up
to 48 hours while stored at room temperature (e.g., 20–25°C), and after repeated freeze/thaw
cycles up to 5 cycles. The results were compared to the result obtained from control samples
and conditions (i.e., timepoint zero / zero cycles).
Based on these results, serum samples may be stored up to 48 hours at room temperature, up
to 14 days at 2–8°C, and may be frozen/thawed for up to 5 cycles when stored at or below -
20°C.
Reagent Stability
Shelf life:
A Real Time stability study was conducted at 3-month intervals using Aptiva CTD Essential
Reagent stored at 2–8°C. At each timepoint, a low-negative sample, a mid-range positive

sample, and a high-range positive sample were tested at time 0, 6, 9, and 12-months with
additional testing scheduled to be performed up to 24 months. The currently available results
support a 12-month stability claim.
An accelerated stability study was performed for 5 weeks at 37°C ± 3°C to simulate 30-
months at 5 ± 3°C. The recovery of the measured values relative to the control stored at 5 ±
3°C was determined and a linear regression analysis was performed between recovery values
and the number of days for each bead component of the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent. At
each timepoint, a minimum of six samples were tested, including low-negative sample, mid-
range positive sample, and high-range positive samples. The accelerated stability testing
results support that the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent may be stable for up to 24-months.
In use (onboard) stability:
To establish the in-use stability of the Aptiva CTD Essential reagent cartridge onboard the
Aptiva instrument, one lot of reagent cartridge was tested using human serum samples for all
analytes. The specimens were tested periodically for 45 days. At day 21, the reagent cartridge
was recalibrated, and a new cartridge specific working curve was generated. Percent
recoveries were calculated compared to the day zero average values, and a linear regression
analysis was performed by plotting percent recovery against time.
The test results support an in-use (onboard) stability for the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent as
36 days with an 18-day recalibration.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
assessed for each analyte in the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent and were calculated
separately based on the recommendations contained in CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB:
To determine the Limit of Blank, four blank samples were prepared using three lots of Aptiva
system rinse, and were run in quintuplicate, once a day, for three days using two reagent lots
for a total of 60 data points per lot. The LoB was determined for each assay, on each reagent
lot separately using Analyse-it for Excel, at the 95th percentile, using the non-parametric
method for all analyses. The higher LoB result between the two lots was selected for the final
LoB value.
LoD:
To determine the LoD for each analyte, four low level samples were contrived for each
analyte by mixing human serum samples with high and low levels of antibodies, and were
assayed in quintuplicate on two reagent lots, twice per day, for three days, for a total of 120
data points for each assay on each reagent lot. The LoD was determined separately for each
assay on each reagent lot and the highest LoD result was selected for the final LoD value.
LoQ:
To determine the LoQ for each analyte, four low level samples were contrived by mixing
human serum samples with high and low levels of antibodies, which were run in
quintuplicate, using two reagent lots, twice per day for three days, to generate 120 data points
for each assay on each reagent lot. The LoQ was determined separately for each assay on
K213403 - Page 30 of 46

--- Page 31 ---
each reagent lot, by calculating the total imprecision of each sample. The LoQ was defined to
be the lowest concentration level that meets the within laboratory imprecision of <20% for
each lot. The LoQ for each assay was determined as the greatest LoQ across the two lots and
set as the lower limit of the AMR.
The LoB, LoD, and LoQ for each measurand is summarized as follows:

(section §VII.D) below.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Samples for the method comparison analysis included the samples from the clinical
validation study (see VII.C below). Samples were tested on both the Aptiva CTD Essential
Reagent and their respective predicate devices. Positive percent agreement (PPA) and
negative percent agreement (NPA), with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each
analyte comparison, excluding values that were outside of the measuring ranges of either
assay. The following tables summarize these method comparison results:

D Clinical Cut-Off:
The cut-off for the dsDNA, SS-B, Ro60, Ro52, Sm, RNP, Scl-70, Jo-1, Centromere and
Ribo-P assay was determined using a cohort of 120 native serum samples from subjects
consisting of 16 patients with celiac disease, 18 patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, 25
patients with infectious diseases, 7 patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), 2
patients with PBC/autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), 8 patients with primary sclerosing
cholangitis (PSC), 1 patient with PSC/AIH, 30 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 13
patients with Lyme disease. This cohort was used to determine a preliminary cut-off value.
The preliminary cut-off was verified using samples from the intended use population to
ensure optimal differentiation for the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent analytes.
The following cutoff is used for the RNP, Sm, Ro52, Ro60, SS-B, Scl-70, Centromere and
Ribo-P assays in the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent:
Negative <5.00 FLU
Positive ≥5.00 FLU
For the dsDNA assay, the following cutoff is used in the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent:
Negative <27.00 IU/mL
Indeterminate 27.00 – 35.00 IU/mL
Positive ≥35.00 IU/mL
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A negative Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent test result is expected for apparently healthy
individuals. To determine the expected values for the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent, a panel of
115 apparently healthy blood donors (71 females/44 males, ages 18 to 59 years, with an average
and median age of 33 years) were tested on the Aptiva CTD Essential Reagent. The results are as
follows:
Number of
Assay Mean concentration Range
samples positive
dsDNA 0 (0.0%)* 5.84 IU/mL 2.30 – 27.71 IU/mL
RNP 2 (1.7%) 0.97 FLU 0.50 - 31.32 FLU
Sm 0 (0.0%) 0.26 FLU 0.25 – 1.12 FLU
Ro52 1 (0.9%) 0.40 FLU 0.25 – 5.64 FLU
Ro60 2 (1.7%) 2.84 FLU 0.50 – 214.80 FLU
SS-B 0 (0.0%) 0.67 FLU 0.40 – 4.84 FLU
Scl-70 1 (0.9%) 1.14 FLU 0.50 – 6.58 FLU
