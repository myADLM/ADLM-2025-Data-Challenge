ACL TOP Family 50 Series of Analyzer (K150877)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The HemosIL ReadiPlasTin kit contains the HemosIL ReadiplasTin Reagent and HemosIL
ReadiPlasTin Diluent. The HemosIL ReadiPlasTin Reagent is a tissue thromboplastin reagent,
and the Diluent is a liposomal preparation that contains recombinant human tissue factor (RTF),
re-lipidated in a synthetic phospholipid blend.
B Principle of Operation:
In the Prothrombin Time (PT) test, the addition of the tissue thromboplastin (ReadiPlasTin
reagent) to the patient citrated plasma in the presence of calcium ions initiates the activation of
the extrinsic pathway. This ultimately results in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, with
formation of a solid gel. Fibrinogen results are quantitated (PT-based method) by relating the
absorbance or light-scatter during clotting to a calibrator.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intermediate precision testing for PT, INR, and Fibrinogen was performed at a single internal
location by a single operator on one ACL TOP 700 and one ACL TOP 750. The study was
conducted for 20 days, with two runs per day and two replicates per run. Each run was at
least two hours apart. Three lots of reformulated HemosIL ReadiPlasTin reagent were used
with tri-level controls to evaluate PT and Fibrinogen. Six native patient samples were tested
for PT/INR at various INR ranges seen in the tables below. Six fibrinogen clinical samples
were used and two sample pools at each concentration were tested, ~100 mg/dL, ~300
mg/dL, and ~600 mg/dL. The acceptance criteria were met for all samples in the studies.

prepare 10 samples ranging from ~60 mg/dL to ~800 mg/dL. The result demonstrates that
HemosIL ReadiPlasTin reagent is linear within the range of 60 to 700 mg/dL for fibrinogen.
A factor linearity study for extrinsic factors II, V, VII and X was performed with one lot of
reformulated HemosIL ReadiPlasTin on an ACL TOP 700 analyzer and an ACL TOP 750
analyzer. Results met acceptance criteria.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference Study
An interference study was performed for unfractionated (UF) heparin, low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH), hemoglobin, triglycerides, bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), and
daptomycin with one lot of reformulated HemosIL ReadiPlasTin for prothrombin time and
fibrinogen on an ACL TOP Family Analyzer.
Two levels of plasma were used: 1) a commercially available normal pooled plasma 2) a
commercially available pool of oral anticoagulant patient samples with an INR 2.0–3.0. The
two sample levels were spiked with multiple levels of the indicated interferent and tested in
quadruplicate. The data was then compared to the un-spiked control result. Interference limits
are found in the table below.

prothrombin time rises above the upper limit of the reference interval. Samples were
prepared by mixing HemosIL factor deficient plasma with normal pool plasma of known
assayed factors to create eight dilutions. Concentrations ranged from 7.8% to 95.1% factor
activity. Prothrombin time was determined on each plasma dilution in duplicate on an ACL
TOP 700 analyzer.

Vial Stopper Compatibility
Five vials of each prototype ReadiPlasTin reagent (P1119220) and diluent (P1119221) were
packed into HemosIL ReadiPlasTin kit cartons (4 kits total) and stored inverted at 2–8°C.
One kit per timepoint (7, 14, 21 and 51 days) was removed and tested for PT recovery of tri-
level controls (Normal, Low Abnormal, and High Abnormal). Vials were reconstituted by
pouring the contents of the diluent directly into the reagent. The mean of five inverted vials
were compared to the mean of five vials stored upright. There was no observed change or
deposits on the stoppers. The results from the study indicate that the reagent and diluent are
compatible with the stopper material.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Real-time Shelf-Life (closed vial)
Real-time shelf-life stability testing was performed using three lots of reformulated HemosIL
ReadiPlasTin tested on one ACL TOP 700 analyzer. Prothrombin time (PT) was tested using
low, normal, and high PT controls as well as four native PT patient samples (1.5–4.0 INR).
Fibrinogen was tested using normal and low fibrinogen controls, as well as two samples at
each of the following three levels of pooled fibrinogen: ~100 mg/dL, ~300 mg/dL, and ~600
mg/dL. The HemosIL ReadiPlasTin reagent was stored at 2–8℃ and tested for eight
replicates at different time points. The shelf-life test is ongoing and the current results
support a 15-month shelf-time claim for HemosIL ReadiPlasTin at 2–8℃.
Open Vial Stability
Open vial stability testing at 2–8℃ was performed using three lots of reformulated HemosIL
ReadiPlasTin tested on one ACL TOP 700 analyzer. PT was tested using low, normal, and
high PT controls as well as four native PT patient samples (1.5–4.0 INR). Fibrinogen was
tested using normal and low fibrinogen controls, as well as two samples at three levels: ~100
mg/dL, ~300 mg/dL, and ~600 mg/dL pooled fibrinogen. The HemosIL ReadiPlasTin
reagent was stored at 2–8℃ and tested for eight replicates at different time points. The
results support an open vial stability claim of 10 days at 2–8℃.

On-Board Instrument Stability
On-board instrument stability testing was performed using three lots of reformulated
HemosIL ReadiPlasTin tested on one ACL TOP 700 analyzer. PT was tested using low,
normal, and high PT controls as well as four native PT patient samples (1.5–4.0 INR).
Fibrinogen was tested using normal and low fibrinogen controls, as well as two samples at
three levels: ~100 mg/dL, ~300 mg/dL, and ~600 mg/dL pooled fibrinogen. The HemosIL
ReadiPlasTin reagent was stored on-board the analyzer and tested for eight replicates at
different time points. The test results support an on-board stability claim of 10 days.
Simulated Shipping Study
Two lots of reformulated ReadiPlasTin were subjected to simulated shipping conditions of
vibration and drop, and summer thermal shipping stress based on the ISTA summer
temperature profile. In addition, a separate set of vials with reformulated ReadiPlasTin were
subjected to -20℃ freeze/thaw stress. After the simulated stress, the same vials were tested
for functionality with plasma controls. The results demonstrate transport stability of
reformulated ReadiPlasTin at temperatures ≤ -20℃ and 35℃.
37℃ Thermal Stability with EDTA Concentration Study
A thermal stress stability study at 37℃ for 28 and 35 days was conducted using two lots of
HemosIL ReadiPlasTin. The HemosIL ReadiPlasTin liquid reagent was spiked with EDTA at
different concentrations (0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5 1.0, 1.5 mM EDTA) prior to the addition of
the diluent and tested for PT. Three levels of quality control material, HemosIL normal, low
abnormal, and high abnormal were ran in duplicate with three reagent vials at each time point
(Day 0, 7, 14, 20, and 28; Day 35 for 1 lot). To determine the optimal EDTA concentration,
the % drift was calculated from the baseline PT (sec) at 2–8℃. This study indicated that 0.5
mM is the optimal amount of EDTA that can be added to the HemosIL ReadiPlasTin reagent.
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Analysis
Two pilot lots with 0.5 mM EDTA and without EDTA, were tested for lipid concentration by
HPLC for 28 and 35 days respectively. Lipid concentration was evaluated quantitatively for
change in concentration over time at 37℃ (Day 0, 7, 14, 20, and 28; Day 35 for 1 lot). Lipid
content was evaluated qualitatively by comparing peak shapes from HPLC chromatograms of
reagent from unstressed vials and stressed vials, with and without EDTA. Pilot vials with 0.5
mM EDTA compared to 0 mM EDTA showed minimal change in lipid content over the 28
and 35 days.
Phospholipase Tolerance
Two pilot lots, with and without EDTA added, were spiked with phospholipases and
thermally stressed at 37°C and then reconstituted with ReadiPlasTin kit matched diluent and
tested with three levels (normal, low abnormal, and high abnormal) of quality control for
PT(s) recovery. Percent (%) drift was calculated and demonstrated pilot lots without EDTA
added do not exhibit tolerance against phospholipases after three days or less of stress. Pilots

with EDTA added demonstrated resistance against phospholipase effects, with 0.5 mM
EDTA showing the greatest tolerance.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison:
An in-house method comparison study was performed to compare the performance of the
reformulated HemosIL ReadiPlasTin assay versus the RecombiPlasTin 2G assay (K070005),
on both one ACL TOP 700 and one ACL TOP 750. The reformulated HemosIL
ReadiPlasTin performed comparably to the HemosIL RecombiPlasTin 2G. All acceptance
criteria were met, including when only vitamin K antagonists (VKA) samples were
evaluated.
