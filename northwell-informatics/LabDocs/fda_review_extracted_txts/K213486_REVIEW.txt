Alinity c ICT Sample Diluent to demonstrate the GLP systems Track barcode sample ID
transmission to the analyzer and analytical equivalence to manual sample introduction versus
automated sample introduction on the analyzer.
B Measurand:
Sodium, Potassium, Chloride
C Type of Test:
Quantitative, potentiometric
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The GLP systems Track is a modular laboratory automation system designed to automate pre-
analytical and post-analytical processing, including sample handling, in order to automate
sample processing in clinical laboratories. The system consolidates multiple analytical
instruments into a unified workflow.
The Alinity c System is a fully automated, random/continuous access, clinical chemistry analyzer
intended for the in vitro determination of analytes in body fluids.
The Alinity c ICT (Integrated Chip Technology) is used for the quantitation of sodium,
potassium, and chloride in human serum, plasma, or urine on the Alinity c analyzer.
Sodium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism (excessive
secretion of the hormone aldosterone), diabetes insipidus (chronic excretion of large amounts of
dilute urine, accompanied by extreme thirst), adrenal hypertension, Addison's disease (caused by
destruction of the adrenal glands), dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, or
other diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.
Potassium measurements are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and treatment
of diseases conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium levels.
Chloride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic
disorders such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The GLP systems Track is a modular laboratory automation system (LAS) used to perform
multiple pre-analytical and post-analytical steps to automate sample preparation and distribution
processes in clinical laboratories. These processes include bar code identification of samples,
centrifugation, aliquoting of samples, decapping of samples, transport of samples between
processes (modules), delivery of samples to Abbott Alinity c-series laboratory analyzers, capping
of samples, and storage of samples. The GLP systems Track consists of the track, modules, and
specific analyzer interfaces used to connect analyzers and the control system. Each module
includes a built-in touchscreen, a user interface that functions as a central operating and display
element. Due to the modular nature of the LAS, customers may select modules and
configurations to fit their laboratory needs.
B Principle of Operation:
Ion-selective electrodes (ISE) for sodium, potassium, and chloride utilize membranes selective to
each of these ions. An electrical potential (voltage) is developed across the membranes between
the reference and measuring electrodes in accordance with the Nernst equation. The voltage is
compared to previously determined calibrator voltages and converted into ion concentration.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
GLP systems Track
2. Specimen Identification:
Barcode identification of patient samples. GLP systems Track reads sample bar codes and
electronically communicates sample identification number to the analyzers.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The patient’s sample tubes are loaded onto the GLP systems Track Input/Output Module
(IOM) or BulkLoader Module to be centrifuged, de-capped, aliquoted, recapped and stored.
The sample bar codes are read to direct the sample to a specific analyzer.
4. Calibration:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed based on recommendations in CLSI EP09c.
The method comparison study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between results for
samples processed using the GLP systems Track and delivered to the Alinity c analyzer
(investigational method) and samples directly loaded on the Alinity c analyzer by the
operator (comparator method).
A total of 100 human serum and plasma samples (50 of each specimen type) were obtained.
The samples were tested for sodium, potassium, and chloride. A subset of samples were
contrived, (either spiked with chemicals containing sodium, potassium, or chloride or diluted
with deionized water) to obtain samples with concentrations at the upper end/lower end of
the measuring interval of the assays.
For the investigational and comparator method, the samples were tested using one lot of
reagent, two lots of calibrator, and one lot of controls. For the investigational method
samples were tested using one GLP systems Track SAL Alinity c-series module and
processed using one Alinity c analyzer. For the comparator method, the samples were tested
using one Alinity c analyzer. Each sample was tested in singlicate using both methods.
Only samples with results that were within the respective measuring interval for both
methods were included in the analysis. A Passing-Bablok evaluation was performed using all
samples by comparing the result from the investigational method versus the result from the
comparator method. The regression analysis results for each assay and specimen type are
summarized in the table below:
