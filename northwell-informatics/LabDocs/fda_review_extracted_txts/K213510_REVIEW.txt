IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA and IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA has been modified
from the previously cleared assay which is susceptible to interference from biotin. The
modification was made to add additional biotin to blocking buffer during solid phase
manufacturing, which eliminates the risk of biotin interference.
B Principle of Operation:
The IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA and IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA are solid-phase
chemiluminescent immunometric assays. The solid phase consists of polystyrene latex beads
coated with anti-CA 125 antibody (Ab). The patient sample incubated with beads and alkaline
phosphatase antibody conjugate which results in a bead pair immunocomplex sandwich
consisting of capture Ab-antigen-detection Ab (30-minute incubation cycle). Next, a wash buffer
is added to remove unbound conjugate (30-minute cycle). Unbound conjugate is removed by
centrifugal wash, following by addition of chemiluminescent substrate to the beads and
incubated for 10 minutes. The chemiluminescent substrate undergoes hydrolysis in the presence
of the alkaline phosphatase to yield an unstable intermediate, which then emits photons. The
sustained emissions are measured by the luminometer. The resulting relative light units (RLU)
are proportional to the concentration of CA 125 in the sample, which is expressed as U/mL.

Within-laboratory precision
Five serum samples were assayed in two replicates per sample per run, two runs per day for
20 days using one lot of reagents on one instrument (N=80 per sample). Sample 1 was native
serum sample, and Samples 2–5 were pooled samples prepared by pooling high CA 125
serum samples with low CA 125 serum samples. The data was analyzed using ANOVA for
standard deviation (SD), % coefficient of variation (%CV) to evaluate within-run, between-
run, between-day, and within-laboratory. The results are summarized below:

2. Linearity:
The linearity study was conducted following CLSI EP06-Ed2. A panel of nine samples was
prepared by mixing high serum native sample with a low native serum sample to cover the
claimed analytical measuring range of each of two assays, IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000
OM-MA and IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA. For each assay, the samples were tested on four
replicates per sample using three reagent lots of each assay on one instrument. The data was
analyzed using weighted least squares linear regression. Percent deviations from linearity
were calculated as differences between the observed values (mean values) and the predicted
values divided by the predicted values. Results are summarized below.

Automatic dilution versus manual dilution (IMMULITE 2000)
To verify the auto-dilution function on IMMULITE 2000 instrument platform, one high
sample (> 500U/mL) was diluted using the onboard dilution function and compared with
dilution of the same sample that was manually diluted by the same dilution factor. The high
native serum pool was diluted using assay diluent 10x, 20x and 40x. The study was
conducted on three kit lots of the modified IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA kits on one
IMMULITE 2000 platform. The dose by onboard dilution was compared to the dose obtained
by manual dilution and % bias calculated and compared to the acceptance criteria. The study
results demonstrated % bias within 10%.
Hook Effect
Hook effect was evaluated by testing samples above the analytical measuring interval: from
500 to 146,000 U/mL. Three lot of reagents of each IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA
and IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA were used. The results showed no hook effect up to 84,500
U/mL for IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA and up to 80,000 U/mL for IMMULITE
2000 OM-MA.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity
The cross-reactivity of the modified IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA and
IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA assays with AFP, CA15-3, CA19-9, and CEA was evaluated by
testing two patient sample pools at low level (between 8–12 U/mL) and one at a mid-level
close to the cut-off (between 17–25 U/mL). Each substance was spiked into test samples, and
control samples were prepared by spiking solvent into the samples. Samples were run in
replicates of five using three lots of the modified IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA,
and three lots of the modified IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA. The results confirmed that the
modified devices have the same cross reactivity information for AFP, CA15-3, CA19-9 and
CEA as presented in K981297 and K983391, respectively. The package insert has the
following table for the cross reactivity:
Compound Concentration
AFP 10,000 IU/mL
CA15-3* 1753 U/mL
CA19-9 4000 U/mL
CEA** 10,000 ng/mL
*Cross-reactivity at 0.41% at analyte concentration of 7.1 U/mL
**Cross-reactivity at 0.05% at analyte concentration of 4.8 U/mL
Interference
The interference of the modified IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA and IMMULITE
2000 OM-MA assays was performed following recommendations of CLSI EP07, 3rd ed.

Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies (HAMA) interference was evaluated by testing two patient
sample pools at ~35 U/mL and ~175 U/mL. The samples were spiked with the commercially
available HAMA Serum Type I (2680 µg/L) and HAMA Serum Type II (3960 µg/L). The
samples were assayed in duplicate on one lot of modified IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000
OM-MA and two lots of modified IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA.
Alkaline phosphatase interference was evaluated by testing three patient sample pools with
CA 125 level at ~10 U/mL, ~21 U/mL, and ~100 U/mL. Alkaline phosphatase was spiked
into test samples to attain a concentration of 700 U/L, control samples were spiked with
solvent used for preparation of test samples. Samples were run in replicates of five on three
lots of modified IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA, and three lots of modified
IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA.
Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), hemoglobin, intralipid (triglycerides), and biotin
interference was evaluated by testing two patient sample pools at low level (~17 U/mL) and
high level (~185 U/mL). Control samples were prepared by spiking of the solvent used to
prepare the test substance into patient sample pools. Test samples were prepared by spiking
working stocks containing the different interferent materials. Samples were run on one lot of
modified IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA, and two lots of modified IMMULITE
2000 OM-MA.
The results for all interference studies were evaluated by calculation % bias between control
and test samples. No significant interferences were observed up to the concentrations listed in
the table below:
Compound Concentration
HAMA 792 µg/L
Alkaline phosphatase 700 U/L
Conjugated Bilirubin 200 mg/L
Unconjugated Bilirubin 200 mg/L
Hemoglobin 381 mg/dL for IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA
192 mg/dL for IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA
Intralipid (Triglycerides) 3000 mg/dL
Biotin 3500 ng/mL

Stability
The shelf-life of the modified reagents were tested using the representative assay,
IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA assay. The study was performed following CLSI EP25-A. Three
native serum sample pools at ~10 U/mL, ~21 U/mL, and ~100 U/mL were prepared and
conditioned by stressing the kits over a period of 30 days at the following temperatures: 15,
25 and 37 °C. Three lots of each of the modified reagent kits were stored over a period of 30
days at the following temperatures: 15, 25 and 37 °C, and assayed at the following
timepoints: 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 days, using one IMMULITE 2000 instrument. The results
were analyzed by calculation first-order degradation kinetics using the Arrhenius equation
approach. The study results supported kit stability for 365 days at 2–8 °C.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) was
established for IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA and IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA
following recommendations of CLSI EP17-A2.
The LoB was determined from the measurement of four analyte-free serum samples tested in
six replicates per sample over three days using two reagent lots. LoB was calculated using
the classical non-parametric approach by establishing the 95% rank.
The LoD was determined from the measurement of five native low-level samples in five
replicates, two runs per day over five days using two lots of reagents on two instruments.
LoD was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of the replicates for the low level samples.
The LoQ was determined based on the LoD study described above using the precision
profile. LoQ was defined as the level meet the %CV of the within-lab imprecision of 20%.
The results are summarized in table below:
IMMULITE/IMMULITE IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA
1000 OM-MA
LoB 0.14 U/mL 0.18 U/mL
LoD 0.38 U/mL 0.43 U/mL
LoQ 2.00 U/mL 3.00 U/mL

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA
A total of 253 native serum samples were tested one run per sample over eight days using
three lots of the modified IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA and one lot of the
predicate device (K981297) on one IMMULITE platform. The samples included 103 samples
from patients with ovarian cancer, 35 samples from patients with non-ovarian cancer (20
prostate cancer, 15 breast cancer), 40 samples from patients with nonmalignant diseases (12
gastrointestinal disease, 4 fibroma, 3 adenoma, 21 genitourinary), 50 samples from healthy
females (25 pre-menopausal, 25 post-menopausal), and additional 25 contrived samples to
cover the upper end of the measuring range. The contrived samples were prepared by mixing
high CA 125 native samples (5% by volume) into low CA 125 native samples. Only the
samples within the measuring ranges of both the modified device and the predicate were
analyzed by Passing-Bablok regression, and the results are summarized below:

C Clinical Studies:
Clinical studies were conducted in K981297 and K983391.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Clinical cut-offs were established in K981297 and K983391.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
To verify the reference range of the modified IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA and
IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA remaining the same as that established in K981297 and K983391, a
total of 50 samples (21 pre-menopausal and 29 post-menopausal female) from apparently healthy
female individuals were tested by following recommendations of CLSI EP28-A3c. Samples were
from subjects representing three major ethnic groups (16 Caucasian, 16 African-American, and
34 Asian). The samples were run in duplicate, three lots of each of the modified reagent kits on
each platform (six lots total). Five samples were excluded due to insufficient volume, three
samples were found elevated (greater than 21 U/mL). The results are summarized in the Table
below.
IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA
Lot 1 Lot 2 Lot 3*
n 50 50 45
n ˂ 21 U/mL 47 47 42
% ˂ 21 U/mL 94% 94% 93%
* five samples were not tested due to insufficient sample volume
IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA
Lot 1 Lot 2 Lot 3
n 50 50 50
n ˂ 21 U/mL 47 47 47
% ˂ 21 U/mL 94% 94% 94%
The result supports that there is no change of reference range established previously in K981297
and K983391 for the modified IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 OM-MA and IMMULITE 2000
OM-MA.
