B Principle of Operation:
The Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic
(“sandwich”) assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel with paramagnetic particles coated
with the thyroglobulin protein. The thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) in the sample bind to
the thyroglobulin. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are
held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. The thyroglobulin-alkaline
phosphatase conjugate is added and binds to the TgAb. After the second incubation, materials
bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away.
Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is
measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration
of TgAb in the sample. The amount of TgAb in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-
point calibration curve.

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the modified Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II assay was assessed in
accordance with the CLSI guideline EP06-Ed2. Low and high pooled native samples were
used to prepare six overlapping linearity series for the AMI. For each series, the lowest
sample was tested in replicates of eight, while all other samples were tested in replicates of
four on one Access 2 Immunoassay System using one reagent lot. The data were analyzed for
weighted linear regression by comparing observed results to expected concentrations for each
sample level. Deviation from linearity was calculated by determining the difference between
observed and linear fit values. The results are summarized in the table below:
Dilution Range
Slope Intercept R2 % Deviation from Linearity
(ng/mL)
< 15 IU/mL: -0.5 to 0.2 IU/mL
0.39 – 20.38 0.93 0.009 0.99
≥ 15 IU/mL: 1.8% to 7.0%
< 15 IU/mL: -0.02 to 0.69 IU/mL
0.85 – 69.40 1.08 -0.05 0.98
≥ 15 IU/mL: -7.7% to 6.5%

211.24 – 850.53 1.26 -47.18 0.90 -16.8% to 17.4%*
459.43 – 1418.88 1.10 -24.97 0.96 -7.7% to 11.0%
961.35 – 2774.13 1.01 -43.97 0.93 -13.0% to 16.1% ^
* one sample with concentration of 607.1 IU/mL showed 16.8% of deviation from the linearity, and one
sample with concentration of 728.2 IU/mL showed 17.4% of deviation from the linearity. The rest of the
samples had %deviation from the linearity within ±10%.
^ one sample with concentration of 1807.8 IU/mL showed -13.0% of deviation from the linearity, and one
sample with concentration of 2943.1 IU/mL showed 16.1% of deviation from the linearity. The rest of the
samples had %deviation from the linearity within ±10%.
The data support the linearity of the claimed analytical measuring interval (AMI) of 1.5
IU/mL to 2,500 IU/mL for the modified Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II assay.
High Dose Hook Effect:
High dose hook effect of the modified Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II assay was
evaluated by testing five serum samples with analyte concentration above the analytical
measuring interval: 3,000, 15,000, 27,000, 39,000 and 51,000 IU/mL. Each sample was
tested in replicates of five using three lots of reagents on one Access 2 Immunoassay System.
The results showed no high dose hook effect up to an analyte concentration of 50,000 IU/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference
Interference studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI guidelines EP07 3rd Ed and
EP37.
Patient sera representing two clinically relevant concentrations (4 IU/mL and 100 IU/mL) of
TgAb were spiked with endogenous and exogenous interfering substances including biotin.
Paired spiked and unspiked (control) samples were assayed in six replicates with three

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
i) Traceability:
Refer to K112933. No change to the traceability of the modified Access Thyroglobulin
Antibody II assay.
ii) Kit stability:
Shelf-life stability ̶ A real-time stability study was performed in accordance with the
CLSI guideline EP25 Ed2 to determine the shelf-life of the modified Access
Thyroglobulin Antibody II kit stored at 2–10°C. One of the reagent pack lots was pre-
stressed to environmental test conditions that simulated potential winter and summer
transport. Five serum samples with TgAb concentrations spanning the AMI in five
replicates was tested using three reagent pack lots on five Access 2 Immunoassay
Systems at multiple time points throughout the claimed stability period and at least one
month past the expiration date. Three quality controls were run in duplicate on each day
to qualify each test run. Results support the 12-month shelf-life stability at 2–10°C for the
modified Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II assay.
In-use reagent stability ̶ In-use stability of the modified Access Thyroglobulin Antibody
II assay was evaluated by testing samples using three lots of reagent packs which were
opened and stored at 2–10°C. The commercial control samples and patient samples,
representing low, medium, and high TgAb concentrations, were tested in duplicate at 10
time points over 58 days. The data supports the open vial stability of the modified Access
Thyroglobulin Antibody II up to 56 days stored at 2–10°C after initial use.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
studies were conducted in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A2. The studies
evaluated two reagent pack lots of the modified Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II assay on
two Access 2 Immunoassay Systems.
The LoB was determined with analyte-free samples including four serum, four lithium
heparin (LiHep) plasma and four EDTA samples. Each blank sample was tested over three
days with one run per day and five replicates per run to obtain a total of 60 replicates per
sample type per reagent lot. The LoB was estimated as the 95th percentile of the
measurements and determined to be 0 IU/mL for all sample types across two lots of reagent
pack. The claimed LoB is 0 IU/mL.
The LoD were determined using 11 serum or LiHep plasma samples with low TgAb levels.
Each sample was tested over five days with one run per day and nine replicates per run to
obtain a total of 45 replicates per sample type per lot. The LoD was calculated as the LoB +
1.645 x SD of the replicates for the low-level samples and determined as 0.4 IU/mL for both
serum and LiHep plasma. The claimed LoD is 0.4 IU/mL.
LoQ used the same samples and testing protocol as described for LoD study. The LoQ,
defined as the mean TgAb value of the sample which fulfills the specification of ≤ 1.5 IU/mL
K213517 - Page 8 of 10

--- Page 9 ---
that corresponds to the TgAb concentration that can be quantitatively determined with ≤ 20%
CV, was estimated as 1.5 IU/mL for serum, and 0.9 IU/mL for LiHep plasma. The claimed
LoQ is 1.5 IU/mL which is the lower limit of the AMI for the modified Access
Thyroglobulin Antibody II.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Refer to K112933
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP09c.
The study evaluated a total of 123 native serum samples and native sample pools spanning
the AMI of the modified Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II assay. Each sample was assayed
in one replicate on a single Access 2 Immunoassay System using three lots of the candidate
device and one lot of the predicate. Three commercial quality controls were run in duplicate
on each day to qualify each test run. Results based on Passing-Bablok regression analysis are
summarized in table below:

2. Matrix Comparison:
To demonstrate that lithium (Li)-Heparin and EDTA plasma samples yield results
comparable with serum samples tested by the modified Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II
assay, 38 matched samples with TgAb concentration across the claimed AMI of the assay
were tested in singlicate with one reagent lot on one Access 2 Immunoassay System.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The reference range for unmodified Access Thyroglobulin Antibody assay (predicate) was
previously established based on a study in which 137 samples from males < 30 years of age were
screened for their serum TSH, and absence of personal or family history of thyroid disease and
non-thyroid autoimmune disease. The 95% non-parametric upper reference limit was determined
to be < 4 IU/mL. Additionally, 519 normal samples collected in the U.S. from both males and
females ranging in age from 18–74 years old were tested. The results indicated that 96% of these
samples < 4 IU/mL.
To verify this reference range, a total of 30 serum samples collected from apparently healthy
donors were tested with modified Access Thyroglobulin Antibody on Access 2 Immunoassay
System. The results showed that 28 of 30 (93.3%) have value < 4 IU/mL with the established
95% non-parametric upper reference limit was < 4 IU/mL. Similar results were also observed for
the predicate using this sample cohort.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
