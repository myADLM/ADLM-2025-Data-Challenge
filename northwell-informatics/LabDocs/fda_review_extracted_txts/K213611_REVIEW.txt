III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Fenom Pro is a portable, non-invasive device to measure fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)
in human breath. FENO is increased in some airway inflammatory processes, such as asthma,
and decreases in response to anti-inflammatory treatment. Fenom Pro measures fractional
exhaled nitric oxide according to guidelines established by the American Thoracic Society.
Measurement of FENO by Fenom Pro is a non-invasive quantitative method to measure the
decrease in FENO concentration in asthma patients that often occurs after treatment with anti-
inflammatory pharmacological therapy as an indication of therapeutic effect in patients with
elevated FENO levels. FENO measurements are to be used as an adjunct to established clinical
assessments. Fenom Pro is suitable for adults and children 6 years and older.
Fenom Pro should be used in a point-of-care healthcare setting under professional supervision.
Fenom Pro should not be used in critical care, emergency care or in anesthesiology.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Fenom Pro may not be used by children under the age of 6 years, including infants, or by patients
who are unable to understand and execute the instructions given by healthcare providers, as
measurement requires patient cooperation.
Fenom Pro should not be used in critical care, emergency care, or in anesthesiology.
All subjects should refrain from eating or drinking for at least 60 minutes before the FENOM
test. Recent intake of nitrate rich food, such as lettuce, spinach, beets, walnuts, peanuts, and
animal organs, can lead to increased FeNO levels.
Smoking reduces exhaled NO levels. Fenom results obtained from subjects who smoke should
only be considered after considering the subject’s smoking history and the potential impact on
NO levels.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Fenom Pro
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Fenom Pro is a point-of-care (POC) breath analyzer that quantitatively measures fractional
exhaled nitric oxide (NO) in expired human breath.
K213611 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
The device is comprised of three major components (main unit, handpiece, and mouthpiece).
The main unit contains a touch screen interface for the user as well as the nitric oxide sensor and
pneumatics needed to sample the patient’s breath. The patient interfaces with the device through
the mouthpiece which is attached to the handpiece. The handpiece is connected to the main unit
via a breath tube. The mouthpiece is a single patient use, disposable component that contains an
anti-bacterial/anti-viral filter. The mouthpiece has an ergonomically designed oval interface to
aid in creating a proper seal during the breath maneuver.
To measure the fraction of exhaled FeNO in human exhaled breath using the Fenom Pro, the
patient performs a breath maneuver by grasping the handpiece attached to the main unit of the
device and exhaling into it. A graphical user interface (GUI) display assists the patient in
keeping their breath flow rate within acceptable limits.
B Principle of Operation:
The candidate device uses solid-state electrochemical sensor technology sensitive to nitric oxide
(NO) compounds. The solid state sensor is preceded by a reactive filter material that renders
(oxidizes) potentially confounding species such as carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH ), and
4
methanol (CH O) inactive, or inert, to the NO sensor. Fenom Pro provides visual and audible
4
feedback during its use. A user performs a breath maneuver by exhaling into the device, and the
graphical user interface (GUI) displays an indication of the user’s breath flow rate, such that the
user can modulate their breath flow rate to be within the acceptable limits. An electrochemical
potential difference between the electrodes of the sensor develops and is proportional to the
amount of NO in the breath sample.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Fenom Pro
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no mechanism to identify the specimen, as it is analyzed at the point and time of
collection. Results are stored in the order they are performed, cataloged by date and time. No
patient information is entered or stored on the device.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user obtains a breath sample by having the subject exhale into the device.
4. Calibration:
The device is calibrated by the manufacturer; no calibration is required by customers.
K213611 - Page 3 of 11

--- Page 4 ---
5. Quality Control:
The device utilizes internal and external quality control procedures. For external quality
control, two measurements (a positive and a negative control) are required to validate device
performance. Quality control should be performed each day of device use.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Analytical precision
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate the within-device precision and repeatability of
the candidate device, based on CLSI EP05-A3. Target values for the precision samples were
measured using a chemiluminescence device calibrated against a NIST traceable NO tank.
Data were collected using 5 candidate devices, over 5 operating days, 2 sessions per day, 4
runs per session with 2 replicates for each concentration, at concentrations of 10, 25, 75 and
200 ppb, by multiple operators. Repeatability is an estimate of variation within one test run in
one day. Within-device precision is an estimate of variation between test runs and days. The
repeatability and within-device precision over the five days was determined for each
concentration.
Precision was evaluated for the 10-second mode and 6-second mode separately and the
results are summarized in the tables below:

2. Linearity:
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate the linearity performance of the candidate device.
Nitric oxide was mixed to create simulated breath gas to obtain 10 NO concentration
levels ranging from 5-330 ppb (5, 10, 15, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, and 330 ppb).
Five replicates were obtained at each level, and ten candidate devices were evaluated in both
the 6-second and the 10-second modes. The range of slope, intercept, and R2 values obtained
are listed in the tables below.
Range of Slopes Range of Intercepts Range of R2
6-second mode 0.96 – 1.03 -1.11 – 1.87 0.99 – 1.00
10-second mode 0.96 – 1.05 -1.58 – 1.23 0.99 – 1.00
Effect of extreme temperature and relative humidity
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the effects of extreme temperature and humidity
conditions on the performance of the candidate device. Two devices were tested in an
environmentally controlled chamber at the four corners of temperature and humidity
extremes (15-30° C and 20-80% RH) at three NO concentrations (15, 75, and 200 ppb) in air
with 5 replicates at each combination of temperature and humidity:

All subjects refrained from eating or drinking for 60 minutes prior to the baseline testing. The
results of the study are shown below and support that there is no significant effect of these
exogenous substances on the measurement of FeNO by the candidate device, if users allow
one hour to pass before a FeNO measurement. The device labeling recommends that no food
or beverage be consumed, and no smoking be done, for at least one hour before taking a
FeNO measurement.

9. Carry-Over:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the potential for carryover from a high
concentration FeNO sample to a subsequent sample. Five devices were evaluated using both
the 6-second and 10-second modes and the FeNO concentrations applied to assess carryover
ranged from approximately 10 to 200 ppb. The results showed no carryover effect.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not applicable. A clinical study was conducted to validate the clinical performance of the
candidate device.
2. Matrix Comparison:
Not applicable. The assay can be run using breath samples only.
C Clinical Studies:

adults 18 years of age and older and 32 children ages 6 – 17) participated in the study where
measurements for FeNO, spirometry, and asthma control questionnaires (ACQ) were
completed at baseline (Visit 1) and two weeks later (Visit 2) after therapeutic agents were
administered. The study included data from a total of 11 sites, and 17 healthcare providers
(operators) assisted with the data collection.
The American Thoracic Society (ATS) defines elevated FENO as >25 ppb for adults and
> 20 ppb for children. The initial (visit 1) FENO inclusion criteria for this study were >30
ppb for adults and >25 ppb for children.
A meaningful decline is defined by ATS as >20% for initial FENO values >50 ppb and >10
ppb for initial FENO values <50 ppb. Among the pediatric subjects, 84.4% showed a
meaningful decline in FeNO. Among the adult subjects, 70.3% showed a meaningful decline
in FeNO. Overall results showed a mean FeNO change of -28.2 ppb (-41.12%) with a mean
SD of 30.89 ppb.
The decline in FeNO was accompanied by the following changes in subjective and objective
asthma measures.
The following secondary outcome measures showed the following after 2 weeks of
corticosteroid therapy that accompanied the fall in FeNO described above.
ACQ: Mean ACQ score fell by 50.0% after corticosteroids.
FEV1: There was a mean FEV change of 12.5% after corticosteroids.
