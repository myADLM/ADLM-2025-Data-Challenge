IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack:
• 100 coated wells (antibody, sheep anti-AFP, binds ≥25 IU AFP/well)
• 20.6 mL conjugate reagent (HRP-mouse monoclonal anti-AFP, binds ≥156 IU AFP/mL)
in buffer with bovine serum and antimicrobial agent
• 15.8 mL assay reagent (buffer containing bovine serum albumin and antimicrobial agent)
Calibrators:
• 1 set of VITROS AFP Calibrators 1, 2 and 3 (human cord serum/plasma derived AFP in
human plasma with antimicrobial agent, 2 mL); nominal values 2, 22 and 220 IU/mL (1st
International Reference Preparation 72/225) (2.42, 26.6 and 266 ng/mL)
• Lot calibration card
• Protocol card
• 24 calibrator bar code labels (8 for each calibrator)
The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack has been modified from the
previously cleared assay which is susceptible to interference from biotin. The modification was
made to allow the biotinylated antibody capture conjugate to be pre-bound to the well, which
eliminates the risk of biotin interference. In addition, the factor used for converting IU/mL to
ng/mL has been changed from 1.04 to 1.21 in order to align the VITROS Immunodiagnostic
Products AFP Reagent Pack to other vendors using the same conversion factor.
K213626 - Page 2 of 10

B Principle of Operation:
An immunometric chemiluminescent immunoassay is used. AFP present in the sample reacts
with a biotinylated antibody (sheep anti-AFP) bound to streptavidin on a microwell. Unbound
sample is removed by washing. In a second incubation, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled
antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti-AFP) binds to the immobilized AFP. Unbound
materials are removed by washing. The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent
reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt)
and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes
the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted
acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are
read by the system. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is directly proportional to the
concentration of AFP present.

Dilution Study
Studies of dilutional recovery were performed. For automatic dilution, five samples were
diluted on the VITROS 5600 System using VITROS High Sample Diluent A (HSDA). Each
sample was diluted 1:20 (1-part sample to 19-parts diluent) and 1:400 (1-part sample and
399-parts diluent) and run in five replicates, on one reagent lot of the updated VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack and one lot of the predicate using one
VITROS 5600 System. For manual dilution, five samples were each diluted by two
laboratory scientists using VITROS HSDA at 1:1000 (1-part sample to 999-parts diluent) and
1:4000 (1-part sample to 3999-parts diluent). Each sample was tested using one reagent lot of
the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack and one reagent lot of
the predicate on one VITROS 5600 System.
The results support an automatic sample dilution ratio up to 1:400 and a manual sample
dilution ratio up to 1:4000 for the updated VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP
Reagent Pack.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Potential interfering and cross-reacting substances were tested for their ability to cross react
or interfere with the performance of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent
Pack using procedures based on the guidelines CLSI EP07 and CLSI EP37.
Interference:
Each potential interfering substance was tested at two analyte concentrations: 4.8 IU/mL
(5.81 ng/mL) and 19.2 IU/mL (23.2 ng/mL). Test samples were prepared by spiking with the
potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances at two different levels. Results
were compared to matched control samples which were spiked with an equal volume of
solvent (blank) where appropriate. The AFP in the test samples and control samples were
measured in five replicates using each of three reagent lots on the VITROS 5600 System.
The recovery was calculated by comparing measurements of the test and control samples. No
interference (≤ ±10% difference of test from control) for the VITROS Immunodiagnostic
Products AFP Reagent Pack up to the concentrations of the potential interfering substances
tested as shown in the tables below:

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The calibration traceability of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack
has not changed since the original clearance K983031. This assay has been standardized
against the WHO/NIBSC First International Reference Preparation 72/225.
Stability:
Shelf-life (unopened) of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack was
evaluated using three lots of kit reagents according to the recommendation of CLSI EP25-A.
Each lot was stored at 2–8 °C and tested in four runs at baseline and monthly thereafter for
12 months with one month post expiration. The data support a shelf-life of the VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack up to 32 weeks when stored at 2–8 °C.
On-board stability of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack was
assessed using three lots of kit reagents stored opened and refrigerated (2–8 °C). Each lot was
tested in four runs at baseline and six additional time points over 12 weeks. Fresh reagent
packs were tested at each time point as reference. The data support an on-board stability of
the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack up to 8 weeks.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack were verified based on the
guideline CLSI EP17.
The LoB was determined by testing four stripped serum pools containing no measurable AFP
using three reagent lots. For each lot, LoB samples were run in two replicates per run, two
runs per day for five days. LoB was defined as the value corresponding to the 95th percentile
of rank position of the distribution of values. The highest LoB value observed across three
lots was 0.112 IU/mL. The claimed LoB is 0.229 IU/mL.
The LoD was determined by testing five samples containing low levels of AFP at 1 to 5
times the LoB concentration using three reagent lots. For each lot, the samples were run in
six replicates per run, two runs per day for five days. The LoD was calculated using a
parametric approach. The highest LoD value observed across three lots was 0.161 IU/mL.
The claimed LoD is 0.476 IU/mL.
The LoQ was determined by testing the same samples used for the LoD study using three
reagent lots on one VITROS 5600 System over eight calendar days. The LoQ was defined as
the value with precision less than or equal to the precision of 20% CV. The results support
the claimed LoQ as 0.800 IU/mL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were conducted by testing 150 serum samples in singlicate using
three reagent lots of the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack
(candidate device) and in duplicate using two reagent lots of the unmodified VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack (predicate device) on one VITROS 5600
System. For the modified device, each sample was tested with each of three reagent lots. For
the unmodified device, each sample was tested using each lot and the mean for each sample
was used in the comparison analysis. Weighted Deming regression was performed, and the
results are summarized in the following table:
Range Y-Intercept (95% CI)
N Slope (95% CI) R2
(IU/mL) (IU/mL)
Lot 1 vs Predicate 150 0.87 to 458 0.99 (0.99; 1.00) 0.02 (-0.03; 0.07) 1.00
Lot 2 vs Predicate 150 0.87 to 458 1.00 (0.99; 1.00) 0.05 (0.02; 0.08) 0.99

< 7.22 < 8.74
To verify this reference range, serum samples from a total of 60 apparently healthy non-smoking
individuals including 30 females and 30 males were each tested on three lots of the modified
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack (candidate device) according to CLSI
EP28-A3c. The results indicated that one male sample (1.67%) tested as 8.19, 8.77 and 8.42
IU/mL for three lots, and another male sample tested as 6.98, 7.26 and 7.00 IU/mL for three lots.
The rest of the samples are all below <7.22 IU/mL across three lots. The established reference
range was verified.
The labeling of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AFP Reagent Pack includes the
following expected values for AFP in malignant and non-malignant conditions, in addition to the
values for AFP in 408 health subjectss:
AFP concentration
0 – 7.22 7.23–15 15.1–100 101–500 >500
N IU/mL IU/mL IU/mL IU/mL IU/mL
(0–8.74 (8.75–18.2 (18.3–121 (122–605 (>605
ng/mL) ng/mL ng/mL) ng/mL ng/mL)
Cancer
Primary Liver 36 2 2 1 7 24
Testicular non- 117 25 10 24 17 41
seminomatous
Non-malignant liver disease
Hepatitis A 50 47 3 0 0 0
Other 53 49 3 1 0 0
Healthy Subjects
Males 210 202 8 0 0 0
Females 198 195 11 0 0 0
The conversion factor from IU/mL to ng/mL has changed from 1.04 to 1.21; the reference
interval and expected ranges in clinical categories are increased by 16% when the result
interpretation uses ng/mL. The labeling states: “AFP results must be interpretated by comparison
with the updated intervals.”; “Serial testing for monitoring of patients should be reported and
interpreted with the same conversion factor and cutoff values.”; “It is recommended that each
laboratory establish its own expected values for the population it serves.”
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
