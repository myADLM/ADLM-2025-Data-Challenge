IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
BD Vacutainer K2EDTA Blood Collection Tubes and BD Vacutainer K3EDTA Blood Collection
Tubes are for collecting, transporting, and centrifuging blood. The blood collection tube consists
of a closure assembly (Vacutainer Hemogard Closure), a plastic (for BD Vacutainer K2EDTA) or
glass tube (for BD Vacutainer K3EDTA) and EDTA additive (dipotassium or tri-potassium). The
EDTA anticoagulant is either spray coated in the dipotassium (K2) form or added as a liquid in
the tri-potassium (K3) form. The EDTA additive prevents specimen coagulation.

The tube is manufactured from either plastic (Polyethylene terephthalate, PET) or glass. The
standard closure assembly is a basic rubber stopper. The tube is also available with the
Vacutainer Hemogard Closure Assembly which consists of a rubber stopper and protective
plastic shield to reduce user exposure to blood. All stopper/closures are color coded to reflect
additive type. The closures included in this submission are either pink or lavender to indicate the
presence of EDTA additive.
B Principle of Operation:
The BD Vacutainer K2EDTA Blood Collection Tubes are plastic, evacuated, and sterile (2 to 10
mL) tubes. The interior of the tube wall is spray coated with K2EDTA which binds calcium ions
thus blocking the coagulation cascade.
The BD Vacutainer K3EDTA Blood Collection Tubes are glass, evacuated, sterile with large
sample volume (7 mL) tubes. The interior of the tube wall is coated with liquid K3EDTA which
binds calcium ions thus blocking the coagulation cascade.

tube-to-tube variation using selected hematology parameters (white blood cells (WBC), red
blood cells (RBC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), hemoglobin (HgB), hematocrit
(HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and platelets). This study was conducted at
one single site. Blood from twenty subjects was collected into the study tubes, which
consisted of three lots of each tube type. Samples were tested for the hematology parameters
within 4 hours of collection at room temperature on the Beckman Coulter LH750 and
Sysmex XE 2100. Performance of the BD Vacutainer K2EDTA Blood Collection Tubes with
Hemogard closure for between-lot variation and between-tube variation showed non-
inferiority for all tube comparisons for the hematology parameters tested on two instrument
platforms when compared with the comparator device.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Shelf-Life Stability
Shelf-life stability studies were conducted by using BD Vacutainer K2EDTA and K3EDTA
Blood Collection Tubes at 12 months and 11 months from date of manufacture, respectively,
comparing with BD Vacutainer K2EDTA and K3EDTA Blood Collection tubes that were
recently manufactured. The studies were conducted by testing selected routine hematology
parameters. Forty-eight apparently healthy subjects with 18 years of age or older were
enrolled in this study. The results showed that the shelf-life for the BD Vacutainer K2EDTA
and K3EDTA Blood Collection Tubes is 10 months when stored at 4–25 °C.
Within-Tube Stability
Within-tube stability was evaluated by using BD Vacutainer K2EDTA and K3EDTA Blood
Collection Tubes for the routine hematology test parameters. Storage conditions included: 12
and 24 hours at room temperature (15–25°C), 24 and 48 hours stored refrigerated (2–8°C),
and 48 hours storage at mixed temperatures (i.e., first 24 hours at room temperature and then
refrigerated for an additional 24 hours). Fifty-seven apparently healthy subjects 18 years of
age or older, were enrolled in this study. The within-tube stability showed that the samples
are stable at 12 and 24 hours when stored at room temperature, 24 hours when stored
refrigerated at 2–8°C, and 48 hours storage at mixed temperatures (i.e., first 24 hours at room
temperature and then refrigerated at 2–8°C for an additional 24 hours).

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison Study:
The method comparison study was conducted at one clinical site including 101 subjects 18
years of age or older. Nine study tubes (three BD Vacutainer K2EDTA Blood Collection
tubes, one BD Vacutainer K3DTA Blood Collection tube, three Greiner Bio One Vacuette
K2EDTA tubes, one Greiner Bio-One Vacuette K3EDTA tube) were collected from each
subject. Samples were tested for the routine hematology parameters (White Blood Cell
Count, Red Blood Cell Count Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Platelet count, Neutrophil%,
Lymphocyte%, Monocyte %, Eosinophil% and Basophil %) on two platforms (Abbott-Cell
Dyn Ruby and Sysmex XN 9100)). For each analyte on each platform, Deming or Passing
Bablok Regression was used to estimate average differences between the evaluation tube
(BD Vacutainer K2EDTA Blood Collection Tubes, BD Vacutainer K3EDTA Blood
Collection Tubes) and the comparator tube (Greiner K2EDTA, Greiner K3EDTA) at
medically relevant points for each analyte on each platform. The results are summarized in
the following tables:
The following tube comparisons were performed for clinical equivalence:
• BD Vacutainer K2EDTA 2 mL vs 2 mL Greiner K2EDTA
• BD Vacutainer K2EDTA 6 mL vs 6 mL Greiner K2EDTA
• BD Vacutainer K3EDTA vs 6 mL Greiner K3EDTA

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
A. Draw Volume Performance
The draw volume study is conducted to demonstrate functional draw volume performance of
BD Vacutainer Blood Collection tube products to confirm retention of vacuum at time-zero
and over shelf life. A sample size of n=90, evenly divided between each of the three product
lots was collected at each test interval for each sterilization dose and storage condition. The
results showed that the BD Vacutainer 2 mL, 3 mL, 4 mL, 6mL and 10 mL K2EDTA Blood
Collection tube met the draw volume acceptance criteria for all intervals over 13 months of
accelerated aging to support a shelf life of 11 months and the BD Vacutainer 7 mL K3EDTA
Blood Collection tube met the draw volume acceptance criteria for all intervals over 13
months of accelerated aging to support a shelf life of 10 months.
B. Breakage Resistance During Drop and Centrifugation Testing
This study is conducted to demonstrate functional breakage resistance performance during
drop testing for plastic tubes and during centrifugation for plastic and glass tubes.
Drop Breakage Resistance: The test article is filled, centrifuged, stored at frozen and
refrigerated temperatures, and then dropped from a set height. Samples are subsequently
inspected for breakage and leakage. A sample size of n=183, evenly divided between each of
the 3 product lots, was collected at each test interval for each sterilization dose and storage
condition.
Centrifugation Breakage Resistance: The test article is filled, centrifuged, and subsequently
inspected for breakage and leakage. a sample size of n=300, evenly divided between each of
the three products lots, was collected at each test interval for each sterilization dose and
storage condition.
The results showed that the BD Vacutainer 2 mL, 3 mL, 4 mL, 6mL and 10 mL K2EDTA
Blood Collection tube met the drop and centrifugation breakage acceptance criteria for all
intervals over 13 months in real time to support the current claimed shelf life of 11 months
and the BD Vacutainer 7 mL K3EDTA Blood Collection tube met the drop and

centrifugation breakage acceptance criteria for all intervals over 13 months in real time to
support the current claimed shelf life of 10 months.
C. Stopper Pullout
Stopper Pullout testing is to demonstrate functional stopper performance in the event that the
stopper is removed from the tube to access the sample and then reinserted. 90 samples were
measured for First Stopper Pullout Force, and n=90 samples were measured for Needle
Withdrawal Force. Results demonstrate that the force holding the stopper in the tube is
greater than the force required to remove the collection needle from the stopper during
sample collection. Second Stopper Pullout testing is to demonstrate functional stopper
performance in the event that the stopper is removed from the tube to access the sample and
then reinserted.
D. Ship Testing
This study was performed to evaluate packaging efficacy and safety during simulated
shipping and handling conditions. Shipping and handling were simulated for temperature
fluctuations, vibrations during shipping, and dropping. A sample size of at least n=30 shelf
packs, evenly divided between each of the three products lots, was collected. The results
showed that the BD Vacutainer 2 mL, 3 mL, 4 mL, 6mL and 10 mL K2EDTA Blood
Collection tube and BD Vacutainer 7 mL K3EDTA Blood Collection tube met the Ship
testing acceptance criteria. Results indicated no occurrence of damage from ship testing.
