III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems is a real-time RT-PCR
test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acids from SARS-CoV-2 in nasal and
nasopharyngeal specimens collected from symptomatic individuals suspected of COVID-19 by
their healthcare provider.
Results are for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Positive results are indicative of the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic
information is necessary to determine patient infection status. Positive results do not rule out
bacterial infection or co-infection with other pathogens.
Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis
for patient management decisions. Results are meant to be used in conjuction with clinical
observations, patient history, recent exposures and epidemiological information, and laboratory
data, in accordance with the guidelines provided by the relevant public health authorities. cobas
SARS-CoV-2 is intended for use by qualified clinical laboratory personnel specifically instructed
and trained in the techniques of real-time PCR and on the use of the cobas 6800/8800 Systems.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
This test is to be used with the Roche cobas 6800/8800 system only.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative is based on fully automated sample preparation (nucleic acid
extraction and purification) followed by PCR amplification and detection. The cobas 6800/8800
Systems consists of two separate instruments, the cobas 6800 System and the cobas 8800
System, which both are fully integrated and allow users to perform multiple PCR-based in vitro
nucleic acid amplification tests. The cobas 6800/8800 Systems consist of the sample supply
module, the transfer module, the processing module, and the analytic module. Automated data
management is performed by the cobas 6800/8800 Systems software(s), which assigns test
results for all tests. Results can be reviewed directly on the system screen and printed as a report.

cobas 8800 instrument
The main system functionality is provided by two Software components: the cobas 6800/8800
System Software and Assay Specific Analysis Packages (ASAPs). The cobas 6800/8800 System
Software provides basic functionality such as a Graphical User Interface (GUI), instrument
management, database functionality, report engines, and LIS interfaces. ASAPs are built using a
common Software framework and provides the assay test run conditions (sample preparation and
PCR parameters), result analysis functionality (result calculation and algorithms), and result
report formatting.
Nucleic acid from patient samples and added internal control RNA (RNA IC) molecules are
simultaneously extracted. Nucleic acid is released by addition of proteinase and lysis reagent to
the sample. The released nucleic acid binds to the silica surface of the added magnetic glass
particles. Unbound substances and impurities, such as denatured protein, cellular debris, and
potential PCR inhibitors, are removed with subsequent wash steps and purified nucleic acid is
eluted from the magnetic glass particles with elution buffer at elevated temperature. External
controls (positive and negative) are processed in the same way.

Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the sample is achieved using target specific
forward and reverse primers for ORF1 a/b non-structural region that is unique to SARS- CoV-2.
Additionally, a conserved region in the structural protein envelope E-gene were chosen for pan-
Sarbecovirus detection. The pan-Sarbecovirus detection sets will also detect SARS-CoV- 2 virus.
Selective amplification of RNA IC is achieved using non-competitive sequence specific forward
and reverse primers which have no homology with the coronavirus genome. A thermostable
DNA polymerase enzyme is used for amplification.
B Principle of Operation:
The cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative master mix contains detection probes which are specific for
the coronavirus type SARS-CoV-2, members of the Sarbecovirus subgenus, and the RNA IC
nucleic acid. The coronavirus and RNA IC detection probes are each labeled with unique
fluorescent dyes that act as a reporter. Each probe also has a second dye which acts as a
quencher. When not bound to the target sequence, the fluorescent signals of the intact probes are
suppressed by the quencher dye. During the PCR amplification step, hybridization of the probes
to the specific single-stranded DNA template results in cleavage of the probe by the 5' to 3'
exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase resulting in separation of the reporter and quencher
dyes and the generation of a fluorescent signal. With each PCR cycle, increasing amounts of
cleaved probes are generated and the cumulative signal of the reporter dye increases
concomitantly. Each reporter dye is measured at defined wavelengths, which enables
simultaneous detection and discrimination of the amplified coronavirus target and the RNA IC.
The master mix includes deoxy uridine triphosphate (dUTP), instead of deoxythymidine
triphosphate (dTTP), which is incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA (amplicon). Any
contaminating amplicons from previous PCR runs are destroyed by the AmpErase enzyme
[uracil-N-glycosylase], which is included in the PCR mix, when heated in the first thermal
cycling step. However, newly formed amplicons are not destroyed since the AmpErase enzyme
is inactivated once exposed to temperatures above 55°C.
Reagents loaded onto the cobas 6800/8800 Systems are stored at appropriate temperatures and
their expiration is monitored by the system. The cobas 6800/8800 Systems allow reagents to be
used only if all the conditions are met. The system automatically prevents use of expired reagents
via encoded radio frequency identification (RFID) tags that are placed on the reagent cassettes,
RMC cassettes and reagent bottles. RFID Labels are used to apply information on test specific
and generic reagent cassettes, control tube containers and generic reagent bottles utilized on the
cobas 6800/8800 Systems.

Within-laboratory precision was examined using a panel of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2
(USA-WA1/2020) cultures diluted in simulated clinical matrix stabilized in UTM. Sources of
variability were examined with a panel consisting of three concentration levels (0.3x, 1x and
3x LoD), using three lots of cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative reagents and three instruments
over a course of 15 testing days (2 runs/day x 3 instruments x 5 days/instrument) for a total of
30 runs. A total of 90 replicates per concentration level were tested over the course of the
study. A negative panel was tested along with the positive panel members. The tables below
summarize the results from the inter-lot precision study, showing the mean Ct values and
calculated SD and % CV for each panel member.

b) Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative was evaluated at three testing sites,
using three reagent lots, with a four-member panel of positive and negative samples resulting
in a total number 216 tests per concentration (not including controls). The positive panel
members contained the SARS-CoV-2 target in negative simulated clinical matrix stabilized
in UTM at three different concentrations (0.3x, 1x, 3x LoD). Each site tested two reagent lots
for six days. Two runs were performed each day and three replicates of each panel member
were performed for each run. An overall SARS-CoV-2 positive result was determined by a
positive detection in either or both SARS-CoV-2 or/and pan-Sarbecovirus channels. The
study results are summarized in Table below.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable; this is a qualitative assay.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a) Cross-Reactivity:
The potential for cross-reactivity (analytical specificity) for cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative
assay was evaluated in a study testing samples containing organisms that are commonly
found in the respiratory tract and might cause similar clinical symptoms as SARS-CoV-2. A
panel of 47 viruses, bacteria, and fungi were included in the study, with each organism tested
in three replicates. The organisms were spiked at concentrations of 1x105 units/mL for
viruses and 1x106 units/mL for bacteria and fungi. Testing was performed with each potential
interfering organism in the absence and presence of SARS-CoV-2 target (spiked at ~3xLoD).
No cross reactivity or microbial interference was observed with the organisms at the
concentrations tested, as shown below. Additional in-silico analysis confirmed no homology
was found between any primers or probes for Bordetella parapertussis, Aspergillus sp, and
Fusobacterium necrophorum, however no wet testing with these organisms was performed.

addition, the test utilizes external controls- cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative Control Kit (low
titer positive control) and cobas Buffer Negative Control Kit (negative control), provided
separately. Three lots of Positive Control were included in the clinical evaluation of the
cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative conducted at three testing sites. The summary of the Ct
values for valid positive and negative control results obtained for each target, combined for
sites and lots, is presented below.

b) Clinical Specimen stability:
The stability of SARS-CoV-2 viral targets during handling, transportation, and storage, was
evaluated using NS and NPS specimens collected in different collection media. Five pools of
NS specimens (collected in cobas PCR media, 0.9% saline and copan UTM) and five pools
of NPS specimens (collected in UTM) were spiked with the inactivated quantified SARS-
CoV-2 virus at 3xLoD. Three replicates per specimen type/storage condition were used. The
study data supported storage for specimens collected in UTM and 0.9% physiological saline
at 2-25°C for up to 48 hours followed by up to 3 days at 2-8°C and
at ≤ -70°C for up to 30 days. Specimens collected in cobas PCR Media can be stored at 2-
25°C for up to 24 hours followed by up to 3 days at 2-8°C and at ≤ -70°C for up to 30 days.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative was determined using an
inactivated quantified SARS-CoV-2 virus (WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2,
NIBSC code: 20/146). LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that can
be detected at a rate of at least 95%. A total of 5 concentration levels (500, 250, 125, 62.5 and
31.25 IU/ml) were prepared by diluting the SARS-CoV-2 target in negative simulated clinical
matrix stabilized in UTM. Three independent dilution series with three lots of reagents were
tested with a total of 24 replicates per concentration.
The concentration level with observed hit rates greater than or equal to 95% was determined to
be the LoD for each of the two targets (SARS-CoV-2 and pan-Sarbecovirus) as described below.

7. Matrix equivalency study:
Because some analytical studies were conducted using simulated matrix, equivalency between
simulated and real clinical matrix was evaluated. SARS-CoV-2 target was diluted to make the
test panel of four concentration levels (0x, 0.3x, 1x and 3x LoD) in each of three matrices
(simulated clinical matrix, nasopharyngeal swab specimen and nasal swab specimen). 25
replicates were tested per each combination.

8. Collection media equivalency (UTM, cobas PCR Media and 0.9% physiological saline)
Equivalency between copan UTM, cobas PCR Media (CPM) and 0.9% physiological saline was
evaluated during the development of the subject IVD device. Paired individual negative nasal
swab samples were collected and tested before and after spiking heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2
virus (WHO International Standard). At least 20 low positive (1.5-2x LoD) and 10 moderate
positive (4x LoD) samples was prepared for each collection media. All negative and positive
samples generated expected results for SARS-CoV-2 in the three collection media tested. The
mean Ct differences between the three collection media was less than 2.
9. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
The inclusivity of cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 was
confirmed by testing nine SARS-CoV-2 strains, including six variant strains. Qualified stocks of
different SARS-CoV-2 were used to prepare concentration levels at and around the LoD. Each
level was tested with four replicates. The lowest concentration at which all four replicates tested
positive are reported in below.

10. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay cut-off for this device was established based on variety of parameter thresholds taken
together by the algorithm to make the qualitative decision whether a curve is to be considered
positive or negative. These parameters (e.g., Ct, max. RFI, max. slope, sigmoidality of curve
shape) are initially set by the algorithm. As the product development progresses, the data is
annotated, and the algorithm is adjusted (“trained”) accordingly. This iterative process in the end
leads to a final set of parameter cut-offs. Selected data from testing of clinical specimens or
cultures spiked into clinical background were used to confirm adequate separation between the
latest Ct value observed in positive specimens in each target detection channel and the assay cut-
off.

Clinical Study Design
The performance of cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative was evaluated in a multi-center study with
three external testing sites evaluating prospectively collected clinical specimens in UTM-RT or
UVT from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. Participants from 12
geographically distributed enrollment centers each provided nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and
nasal swab (NS, anterior nares) specimens as part of a dual collection where (a) the collection
order (first specimen collected) was alternated between the NPS and NS specimen, and (b) the
collection method for NS specimens was also alternated with 50% of the NS specimens were
self-collected on-site with healthcare provider (HCP) instructions while the other 50% were
collected by the healthcare provider. The study used a composite comparator method wherein
laboratory sites used up to three highly sensitive EUA SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays, testing
NPS specimen from each subject. The composite comparator result was defined as the
concordant results from two comparator assays (test A and test B). In case of discordance
between the initial two comparator assays, the sample was tested by a third assay (test C) and the
result of the third test determined the composite comparator result. The composite comparator

result was indetermined when valid results could not be obtained from two assays (i.e.,
insufficient volume for repeat testing of invalid/failed results).
From March to June 2021, a total of 1,154 participants were enrolled, of which samples from
968 participants were included in the evaluation. Samples from 186 participants were not
included: 184 specimens were excluded due to issues associated with specimen shipments and/or
being unable to complete testing within the times identified by manufacturer’s instructions, and
two subjects were excluded for being previously enrolled in the study (exclusion criteria). When
self-reporting COVID-19 vaccination status, 207 (21.4%) of the 968 participants were fully
vaccinated.
Of the 968 participants, 961 contributed a NPS specimen which resulted in 942 participants with
a confirmed infected status. For NPS, 4 specimens had failed/invalid cobas SARS-CoV-2
Qualitative results, resulting in 938 evaluable NPS results. For NS, 8 specimens were
invalid/missing cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative NS results, resulting in 934 evaluable results.
When compared with the NPS composite comparator result, cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative
yielded a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 98.7% for NPS and 97.4% for NS specimens. The
negative percent agreement (NPA) was 99.7% and 99.9% for NPS and NS specimens,
respectively.
