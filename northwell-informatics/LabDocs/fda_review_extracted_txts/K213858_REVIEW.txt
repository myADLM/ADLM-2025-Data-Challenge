A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The DiaSorin LIAISON Calprotectin assay is an in vitro diagnostic chemiluminescent
immunoassay (CLIA) intended for the quantitative measurement, in human stool, of fecal
calprotectin, a neutrophilic protein that is a marker of mucosal inflammation. The LIAISON
Calprotectin assay can be used as an aid in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD),
specifically Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, and as an aid in differentiation of IBD from
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Test results are to be used in conjunction with information
obtained from the patients’ clinical evaluation and other diagnostic procedures. The test has to be
performed on the LIAISON Analyzer Family.
The DiaSorin LIAISON Q.S.E.T. Device Plus (Quantitative Stool Extraction and Test) is
intended for use in the preparation of human stool specimens for testing in the LIAISON
Calprotectin assay.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
LIAISON XL Analyzer (K181464)
LIAISON XS Analyzer (K193532)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Refer to K182698 for the DiaSorin LIAISON Calprotectin reagent system. Reagent formulations
for the LIAISON Calprotectin assay are unchanged.
LIAISON Q.S.E.T Device Plus (optional): The device consists of a polypropylene tube
containing 6.0 mL of LIAISON Q.S.E.T. extraction buffer, and a stick shaped with grooves for
collecting the sample. The blue upper cap end of the device contains the sample wand, and can
be separated from the black inner cap which eliminates excess material from the collection tube
containing extraction buffer. Separate instructions are provided for pipetting 12 μL of liquid
sample (e.g. Bristol Stool Form Scale [BSFS] type 7) directly into the collection tube of the
LIAISON Q.S.E.T. Plus from liquid stool samples. Design, manufacturing, and materials are
similar to the Q.S.E.T. extraction device cleared in K182698.
B Principle of Operation:
Refer to K182698 for Test Principle of the LIAISON Calprotectin assay.
K213858 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
The optional Q.S.E.T. Plus device collects the amount of stool required to perform the LIAISON
Calprotectin assay directly from a primary specimen container instead of manually weighing the
sample, or using the alternate, cleared Q.S.E.T. device. Following extraction with the Q.S.E.T.
Plus device, the sample can be used the LIAISON Calprotectin assay procedure, per K182698.
Pre-analytical processing of fecal samples is accomplished by either manual weight
normalization, followed by homogenization in Q.S.E.T. buffer (per K182698); or by using the
optional Q.S.E.T (per K182698) or Q.S.E.T. Plus devices for sample collection and
homogenization. The Q.S.E.T Device Plus may be loaded directly onto LIAISON XL or
LIAISON XS analyzer sample racks.
Following measurement, the assay reports calprotectin concentrations in units of microgram-per-
gram of starting fecal sample material (μg/g). Interpretation of fecal calprotectin concentration
[fCal] is as follows:
[fCal] (μg/g) Interpretation

Q.S.E.T. Device Plus Sample Weight Validation
The manufacturer performed a study evaluating the precision of the amount of the sample
collected by the Q.S.E.T. Device Plus sample collection device. Five stool specimens ranging
from Types 2‒7 on the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) were sampled by three operators
with five replicates per sample per operator, using three lots of the Q.S.E.T. Device Plus
sample collection device. Samples on the Q.S.E.T. Device Plus sample collection device
were weighed against the empty weight of the Q.S.E.T. Device Plus device. Results of the
