III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The DRI™ Tricyclics Serum Tox Assay is a homogenous enzyme immunoassay intended for the
qualitative and/or semiquantitative determination of the presense of tricyclic antidepressants
(TCAs) in human serum, plasma, or urine of patients at a cutoff concentration of 300 ng/mL in
patients suspected of drug overdose.
The semi-quantitative mode is for the purpose of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method sych as Liquid
Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or permitting laboratories to
establish quality control procedures.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Liquid Chromatography/Tandem
Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.
Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particulary
when preliminary positive results are used.
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Architect c4000 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The DRI TM Tricyclics Serum Tox Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay used to detect
tricyclic antidepressants in serum, plasma, or urine. The DRI TM Tricyclics Serum Tox assay is
supplied as a two liquid reagent kit (Reagent A and Reagent E). They are bottled separately
within the same kit, as described below:
K213875 - Page 2 of 18

--- Page 3 ---
• Antibody/Substrate Reagent (Reagent A) 1 bottle of 25 mL (1 x 25 mL): Contains
polyclonal anti-tricyclics antibodies (sheep), glucose-6- phosphate (G6P), and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in Tris buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.
• Enzyme Conjugate Reagent (Reagent E) 1 bottle of 8 mL (1 x 8 mL): Contains glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled with nortriptyline in Tris buffer with sodium
azide as a preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
The test is based on the competition of an enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PDH), labeled-drug and the drug from the sample for a fixed amount of specific antibody
binding sites. In the absence of the drug from the sample, the specific antibody binds the
enzyme-labeled drug and the enzyme activity is inhibited. This phenomenon creates a direct
relationship between drug concentration in the sample and the enzyme activity. The enzyme
activity is determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by measuring its ability to convert
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.

2. Linearity:
Drug-free serum or drug-free urine was spiked with Nortriptyline to the concentration of the
high calibrator level and diluted with drug-free serum or drug-free urine to generate 9
intermediate levels. Five (5) replicates of each sample using one (1) lot of reagents,
calibrators, and controls were run in semi-quantitative mode and the average was used to
determine percent recovery compared to the expected target value.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The cross-reactivity of tricyclic antidepressants as well as their metabolites was evaluated by
adding known amounts of each compound to drug-free serum and urine. The specificity
(cross-reactivity) study was performed using one lot of reagents, calibrators and controls in
both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Two (2) replicates of each cross-reactant
sample were run in qualitative and semi-quantitative modes on the Architect c4000 clinical
chemistry analyzer. Percent cross-reactivity was calculated as (cut-off concentration / lowest
concentration observed that provides a reliably positive result) x 100. Results are
summarized in tables #6 and #7 below:

A specificity study of structurally unrelated compounds/or concurrently used drugs was
evaluated by adding known amounts of each compound to low and high controls (225 and
375 ng/mL) in serum and urine. The study was performed using one lot of reagents,
calibrators and controls in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Two (2) replicates
of each cross-reactant sample were run in qualitative and semi-quantitative modes on the
Architect c4000 clinical chemistry analyzer. Results are summarized in tables #8 and #9
below:

concentrations of 4,000 ng/mL in serum, positive results were observed. Device labeling
includes the following limitation: “Patient samples containing tricyclic antidepressants in the
presence of carbamazepine may yield falsely elevated results in the TCA immunoassay.
Results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical
examinations, and other clinicopathological findings.”
Interference Testing of exogenous and endogenous compounds
Interference from various compounds was evaluated by adding known amounts of each
compound to drug free serum and urine samples containing near cutoff negative (225 ng/mL)
and near cutoff positive (375 ng/mL) concentrations of Nortriptyline. Testing was performed
in both qualitative and semiquantitative modes. The compounds listed in the table below did
not cause any positive or negative interference at the concentrations shown:

Interference Testing of Specific Gravity and pH (Urine):
Drug free urine samples with specific gravity ranging in value from 1.004 to 1.030 were split
and spiked with Nortriptyline to near cutoff negative (225 ng/mL) and near cutoff positive
(375 ng/mL) concentrations. Samples were evaluated in qualitative and semi-quantitative
modes. The following specific gravities did not cause any positive or negative interference:

Sample APP9489-2 contains the following parent Tricyclic antidepressants: Amitriptyline
at 8.08 ng/mL, Imipramine at 18.35 ng/mL, Desipramine at 46.35 ng/mL, and
Nortriptyline at 17 ng/mL by LC-MS/MS which cross-react at 100%, 158% 120% and
100% respectively by immunoassay. In addition to the tricyclic antidepressants identified,
another cross-reacting drug compound was detected in the sample, as below:
Drug Class Drug Name LC-MS/MS value (ng/mL)
Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine 4275
Sample APP9474-2 contains Amitriptyline at 9.08 ng/mL, Imipramine at 19.9 ng/mL and
Desipramine at 49.8 ng/mL, and Nortriptyline at 19.65 ng/mL by LC-MS/MS and cross-
reacts at 100%, 158% 120%, and 100% by immunoassay accordingly. In addition to the
tricyclic antidepressants identified, another cross-reacting drug compound was detected in
the sample, as below:
Drug Class Drug Name LC-MS/MS value (ng/mL)
Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine 5285
2. Matrix Comparison:
50 Patient specimens were run in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. The testing
specimens consisted of matched sets of; Serum, K2-EDTA, K3-EDTA, Lithium Heparin,
Sodium Citrate, Potassium Oxalate samples; as well as 45 secondary matched sets of Serum
and Sodium Heparin samples. The Nortriptyline concentrations of the samples tested
spanned from approximately 135 ng/mL to approximately 930 ng/mL. The study
demonstrates Nortriptyline concentrations obtained in different test plasma matrices with
different anticoagulants are equivalent to those measured in the primary or control matrix,
serum across the assay’s measuring range.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
2. Clinical Specificity:
Not applicable.
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Not applicable.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Qualitative results
A sample that exhibits a change in absorbance (ΔA) value equal to or greater than the cutoff
calibrator is considered positive. A sample that exhibits a change in absorbance (ΔA) value
lower than the cutoff calibrator is considered negative.
Semiquantitative results
A rough estimate of drug concentration in the samples can be obtained by running a standard
curve with all calibrators and measuring samples off the standard curve.
Immunoassays that produce only a single result in the presence of a class of drugs such as
Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) cannot accurately measure the concentration of each
individual component. For a qualitative application, a positive result indicates only the presence
of TCAs. For a semiquantitative application, the assay gives an approximate, cumulative
concentration of TCAs.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
