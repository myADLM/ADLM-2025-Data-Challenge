D Special Instrument Requirements:

software (or later)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the organism
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-YS Caspofungin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.125, 0.5, 2,
and 8 (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The caspofungin MIC
result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤0.125 – ≥8 μg/mL. For all species, the VITEK 2 system is
capable of reporting the following MIC results: ≤0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and ≥8 μg/mL for the
AST-YS Caspofungin test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

In summary, the FDA and CLSI recommended QC strains, Candida krusei (ATCC 6258) and
Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019), were tested a minimum of 20 times at each site by the
reference broth microdilution method, the VITEK 2 (auto- and manual dilution methods),
and the VITEK 2 Compact using the manual dilution method.
The quality control results for the VITEK 2 AST-YS Caspofungin were within the expected
range ≥95% of the time, which is acceptable.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Performance after reanalysis and additional testing:
The VITEK 2 AST-YS Caspofungin was originally cleared in premarket submission
K151817. Since there were no changes to the design or dilution range of the VITEK 2 AST
card, performance evaluation was achieved via reanalysis of the MIC data provided in the
original 510(k) submission (K151817) using revised interpretive criteria currently recognized
by FDA for caspofungin against Candida spp. In summary, performance data for the five
currently claimed Candida species (599 clinical isolates and 50 challenge isolates of C.
candida, C. guilliermondii, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis) were reanalyzed. An
additional 31 challenge isolates were tested with both the automatic and manual dilution
methods on the VITEK 2 and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact to
address the insufficient number of challenge isolate results due to the removal of C. glabrata
from the intended use and exclusion of the corresponding data, for a total of 75 challenge
isolate results.

EA – Essential Agreement min – minor errors
CA – Category Agreement maj – major errors
EVAL – Evaluable isolates vmj – very major errors
R – Resistant isolates
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the MIC result of the reference
method and that of the VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus two serial two-fold dilutions of the
antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the VITEK 2 test card and the
reference method or those in which an off scale result is at least two doubling dilutions from the on
scale result. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference
method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK 2 test card.

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the MIC result of the reference
method and that of the VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus two serial two-fold dilutions of the
antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the VITEK 2 test card and the
reference method or those in which an off scale result is at least two doubling dilutions from the on
scale result. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference
method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK 2 test card.
The updated breakpoints for casponfungin with Candida spp. lowered the susceptible
breakpoint by three-fold dilutions for some species and established the intermediate and
resistant breakpoints for all Candida spp. As summarized in Table 1, applying the updated
breakpoints with the VITEK 2 automatic dilution method for Candida spp. and excluding
data from C. glabrata did not affect the combined Essential Agreement, but did reduce the
combined Category Agreement from 99.8% in K151817 to 97.5% in the current submission
due to an increase in minor errors from 0 (0%) to 15 (2.2%). As summarized in Table 2,
applying the updated breakpoints with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact with the manual
dilution method for Candida spp. and excluding data from C. glabrata reduced the combined
Essential Agreement from 100% in K151817 to 98.8% in the current submission as well as
the Category Agreement from 100% to 91.4% for the VITEK 2 and 92.6% for the VITEK 2
Compact due to an increase in minor errors from 0 (0%) to 5 (6.3%) and very major errors
from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%).
When evaluating performance data at the individual species-level, C. krusei had 11 (36.7%)
minor errors with the VITEK 2 automatic dilution method, three (50%) minor errors with the
VITEK 2 manual dilution method, and two (33%) minor errors with the VITEK 2 Compact.
All C. krusei minor errors occurred at a VITEK MIC value of ≤0.125 or 0.25 µg/mL and
were in essential agreement with the reference method.
C. albicans had one (100%) very major error at a VITEK MIC value of 0.25 µg/mLwith the
VITEK 2 automatic dilution method and one minor error with both the VITEK 2 and VITEK
2 Compact with the manual dilution method.
C. tropicalis had two minor errors with the VITEK 2 (automatic and manual dilution) and
VITEK 2 Compact and one (100%) very major error at a VITEK MIC value of 0.25 µg/mL
with the VITEK 2 (automatic and manual dilution methods) and a VITEK MIC value of
≤0.125 µg/mL with the VITEK 2 Compact.
The following limitation was added to the package insert to address the minor and very major
errors errors observed:

“Perform an alternative method of testing prior to reporting of results for the following
antibiotic/organism combination(s):
• Caspofungin (cas02n): Candida krusei when the MIC is 0.25-0.5 µg/mL (if
critical to patient care)
• Caspofungin (cas02n): Candida albicans when the MIC is 0.25 µg/mL (if critical
to patient care)
• Caspofungin (cas02n): Candida tropicalis when the MIC is 0.25 µg/ with the
VITEK 2 and when the MIC is ≤0.125 µg/mL with the VITEK 2 Compact (if
critical to patient care)”
In addition, to explain the very major errors observed, the following statement is included as
a footnote to the performance table in the device labeling:
“One very major error was observed for C. albicans and one very major error was
observed for C. tropicalis using the VITEK 2 (both the automatic and manual dilution
methods). Each very major error was the only resistant isolate tested and was within
essential agreement with the reference method. One very major error was observed for C.
tropicalis using the VITEK 2 Compact. This very major error was the only resistant
isolate tested and was not within essential agreement with the reference method.”
Due to the lack of resistant organisms available for testing, the following limitation statement
was added to the package insert:
“The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s) is
unknown because resistant strains were not available at the time of comparative testing:
• Caspofungin (cas02n): Candida albicans, C. guilliermondii, C. krusei, C.
parapsilosis, C. tropicalis”
As required under 511A(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the
following statement was added to the package insert to address testing of non-indicated
species:
“Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those found
in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of susceptibility
information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for specific
antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.”
MIC Trending Analysis:
An analysis of trending was conducted using the combined clinical and challenge data. This
trending calculation considers MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling
dilutions lower or higher compared to the reference method irrespective of whether the
device MIC values are on-scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower,
at least one dilution higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not
considered in the trending analysis.
K213899 - Page 9 of 11

--- Page 10 ---
Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs. lower
MIC values was ≥ 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined to be
statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that showed
higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in labeling.

A trend toward lower MIC values was observed for C. albicans, C. guilliermondii, C. krusei,
C parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis when compared to the CLSI broth microdilution reference
method, as summarized in Table 3. The following statement is included as a footnote to the
performance table in the device labeling to address the observed trending:
“VITEK 2 Caspofungin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one
doubling dilution lower when testing Candida albicans, Candida guiliermondii, Candida
krusei, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis compared to the broth
microdilution reference method.”

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the BioMerieux VITEK2 AST-Yeast Caspofungin (≤0.125 - ≥8
µg/mL) when revised breakpoints for Caspofungin are published on the FDA STIC webpage.
The breakpoint change protocol included with the submission indicated that if specific criteria
are met, BioMerieux will update the Caspofungin device label to include (1) the new
breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket
notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined by their
evaluation.
