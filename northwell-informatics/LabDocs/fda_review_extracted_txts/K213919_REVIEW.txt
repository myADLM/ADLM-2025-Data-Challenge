III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System is a real time, continuous
glucose monitoring device indicated for the management of diabetes in persons 2 years and
older.
The Dexcom G7 CGM System is intended to replace fingerstick BG testing for diabetes
treatment decisions. Interpretation of the Dexcom G7 CGM System results should be based on
the glucose trends and several sequential sensor readings over time. The Dexcom G7 CGM
System also aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating
both acute and long-term therapy adjustments.
The Dexcom G7 CGM System is also intended to autonomously communicate with digitally
connected devices, including automated insulin dosing (AID) systems. The Dexcom G7 CGM
System can be used alone or in conjunction with these digitally connected medical devices for
the purpose of managing diabetes.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
• Users of the Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System can take a standard
dose of acetaminophen (up to 1 gram every 6 hours in adults) and still use the Dexcom
G7 System readings. Sensor glucose readings will be falsely higher if the user is taking
more than a standard acetaminophen dose.
• Sensor glucose readings will also be falsely higher if the user is taking hydroxyurea.
Users should not use the Dexcom G7 System for diabetes treatment decisions if they are
taking hydroxyurea.
• Don't wear any Dexcom G7 CGM System component during magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. However, it's safe
to have a CT scan if you keep the sensor out of the scanned area and cover the sensor
with a lead apron during the scan.
• Don't ignore low/high symptoms: Use BG meter to make treatment decisions when the
sensor readings don't match the user's low/high symptoms. If needed, seek immediate
medical attention.
• Use BG meter to make treatment decisions when the Dexcom G7 CGM System doesn't
show both a number and trend arrow as well as during the 30-minute sensor warmup
period.
• Don't use if on dialysis or critically ill: The Dexcom G7 CGM System performance hasn't
been evaluated in these populations and sensor readings may be inaccurate.
• Don't ignore broken or detached sensor wires. If this happens, contact 24/7 technical
support.
K213919 - Page 2 of 25

--- Page 3 ---
• Insert only in the arm or buttocks: Don’t wear it on other sites as it may not work as
expected.
• Store sensors at room temperature or in the refrigerator, between 36° F and 86° F, but
not in the freezer.
• Check settings: Make sure the smart device volume is turned up, not muted, and the
speaker works. When a headphone is connected, alerts will only sound through the
headphone, not on the smart device speaker.
• Make sure Bluetooth is on. Otherwise, the user won't get readings or alerts.
• Make sure the smart device settings follow Dexcom’s recommended settings.
Certain phone settings such as Android's Digital Wellbeing and Apple’s Screen
Time may prevent notifications if enabled.
• Allow Dexcom G7 CGM System app notifications to show on Lock screen. This
will ensure the user can receive Dexcom notifications and allow the user to see
notifications without unlocking the phone.
• Android users must allow Location Permission, Do Not Disturb Access, and
Notifications to use the app.
• Apple users must allow Critical Alerts to use the app.
• Battery: Keep the battery charged.
• Quiet Mode (Vibrate): When this setting is enabled all System alerts will vibrate. The
Urgent Low Glucose and technical alerts will still escalate to sound if not acknowledged.
• Quiet Mode (Silence All): When this setting is enabled, all System alerts will be silent.
The user won't receive sound or vibration for any alerts. The user will still receive visual
alerts on the display device. (Exceptions: App Stopped alerts will still sound.) Check the
display device frequently to avoid missing a low/high event.
• Before upgrading the smart device or its operating system, check
dexcom.com/compatibility. Always update manually and verify correct device settings
afterward.
• Let the date and time on the smart device automatically update when traveling across
time zones or switch between standard and daylight saving times. Don’t manually change
the smart device time because the user may not get readings or alerts and it may make the
time on the trend screen wrong.
Use electrical equipment as directed:
Portable radio frequency communications equipment (including peripherals such as antenna
cables and external antennas) should be used no closer than 12 inches to any part of the Dexcom
G7 CGM System including cables specified by the manufacturer. Otherwise, degradation of the
performance of this equipment could result.
Use of this equipment adjacent to, or stacked with, other equipment should be avoided because it
could result in improper operation.
Not using supplied USB charger and cable may cause the receiver battery to not charge. Don't
use if the supplied USB charger or cable is damaged. Store supplied USB charger and cable
safely. Misuse of the USB cable can be a strangulation risk.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (G7 System) is an interoperable
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system intended to continuously measure the glucose in
the interstitial fluid, calculate the glucose reading and make this value available to the user. It
consists of the following components:
• G7 Glucose Sensing Subsystem (GSS)
• G7 Mobile Applications Subsystem (MAS)
• G7 Receiver Subsystem (RVS)
To achieve the intended functions and performance of the G7 System, one GSS and one
receiving device (MAS or RVS) must be used together. The receiving device acts as the primary
display device and the user may choose to use only the MAS or only the RVS as the sole display
device; they may also choose to use both display devices simultaneously (MAS and RVS). The
user must pair the receiving device(s) with each unique GSS to enable communication and start a
sensor session. During an active session, the GSS reports new glucose data to a receiving device
every 5-minutes. The receiving device then displays glucose data and provides alerts and
information signals to the user. The reportable glucose range for the G7 System is 40 mg/dL to
400 mg/dL. Glucose values below this range are reported as ‘LOW’ and glucose values above
this range are reported as ‘HIGH’. The sensor has an expected wear period of up to 10 days with
an extended 12-hour grace period after the sensor session. The grace period allows additional
time for the user to change the sensor at a convenient time.
The Dexcom G7 System is an interoperable connected device that can communicate glucose
readings and other information wirelessly and securely to and from interoperable electronic
interfaces; including compatible AID systems.
B Principle of Operation:
The Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System detects glucose levels from the fluid
just beneath the skin (interstitial fluid). The sensor probe continuously measures glucose
concentration in the interstitial fluid via an enzymatic electrochemical reaction using glucose
oxidase. The enzyme, glucose oxidase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and produces hydrogen
peroxide. The production of hydrogen peroxide generates an electrical current that is
proportionate to the interstitial glucose concentration. The transmitter converts the signal using
an algorithm to a glucose value read in mg/dL, which is then transmitted to the receiver/mobile
application for the user to see and use accordingly.

2. Linearity:
The reportable range for the System is 40 to 400 mg/dL. Data supporting this claimed
measurement range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3) below.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Users of the Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System can take a standard or
maximum dose of acetaminophen (up to 1 gram every 6 hours in adults) and still use the
Dexcom G7 System readings. Sensor glucose readings will be falsely higher if the user is
taking more than a standard acetaminophen dose.
Sensor glucose readings will also be falsely higher if the user is taking hydroxyurea. Users
should not use the Dexcom G7 System for diabetes treatment decisions if they are taking
hydroxyurea.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See Linearity section above.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The Dexcom GSS (sensor and transmitter) has a storage shelf-life of up to 9 months with the
insert molded needle hub design and up to 6 months with the bonded needle hub design.
Shelf life was evaluated at 35.6°-86°F and 10-90% relative humidity. Sensors should be
stored at 36°- 86°F and 10-90% relative humidity.

the safety and effectiveness of the Dexcom G7 CGM System. A total of 482 adult and
pediatric subjects (ages 2 and older) were enrolled.
K213919 - Page 10 of 25

--- Page 11 ---
• Study 2 – a pivotal study conducted at two clinic sites in the United States to evaluate
the data transmission reliability of the Dexcom G7 CGM System. A total of 60 adult
and pediatric subjects (ages 12 and older) were enrolled.
The G7 wearables (sensor, data-logging transmitter, and adhesive patch) worn in Study 1 logged
the glucose data but did not transmit real-time glucose data to a display device. As such, Study 2
was conducted to characterize the reliability of the real-time communication between the G7
wearable and the G7 display devices.
Data from Study 1 are presented in the tables below.

Tread Accuracy
Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose
and are characterized by slopes, such as from >2 mg/dL to <-2 mg/dL. Trend accuracy was
assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change (changes in mg/dL of glucose per
minute) determined by the iCGM values and the corresponding comparator values for each
iCGM-comparator measured pairs (typically collected once every 15 minutes).

Agreement When iCGM Reads “LOW” or “HIGH”
G7 reports glucose readings between 40 and 400 mg/dL. When G7 determines the sensor reading
is below 40 mg/dL, it displays “LOW” on the receiver or mobile app. When G7 determines the
glucose level is above 400 mg/dL, it displays “HIGH” on the receiver or mobile app. Because the
System does not display glucose values below 40 mg/dL or above 400 mg/dL, the comparisons
to the actual blood glucose levels (as determined by the comparator method) when the iCGM
value is classified as LOW or HIGH is evaluated separately, and the cumulative percentages
when laboratory comparator values were less than certain glucose levels (for LOW), and when
laboratory comparator values were greater than certain glucose levels (for HIGH) are presented
in the table below.

Alert Performance
The Hypoglycemic Alert Rate shows how often the alert is right or wrong. The True Alert Rate
is the % of time the device alarmed when the blood glucose level was at or below the alert
setting within 15 minutes before or after the device alarmed (as confirmed by the comparator
method). The False Alert Rate is the % of time the device alarmed when the blood glucose level
was above the alert setting within 15 minutes before or after the device alarmed. The Correct
Detection Rate is the % of time the device alarmed when the blood glucose level was at or below
the alert setting within 15 minutes before or after the hypoglycemic event. The Missed Detection
Rate is the % of time the device did not alarm when the blood glucose level was at or below the
alert setting within 15 minutes before and after the hypoglycemic event.

Sensor Stability
Sensor stability describes the performance over the sensor intended lifetime (up to 10 days,
including the optional 12-hour grace period). Performance was estimated by calculating
the percentage of iCGM readings within 15 mg/dL or 15% (15/15%), 20 mg/dL or 20%
(20/20%), and 40 mg/dL or 40% (40/40%) of the laboratory comparator values at the
beginning (Day 1, 2), middle (Day 4, 7), and end (Day 10, 10.5) of the System lifecycle.

Sensor Life
A total of 460 sensors worn on the arm by adult and pediatric subjects were evaluated to
determine the percentage of sensors that lasted through the 10-day sensor life. Seventy-nine
percent (79%) of the 460 sensors lasted through the end of the entire wear period (e.g., Day 10).
Among the 460 sensors evaluated, 66 sensors (14.3%) had “early sensor shut-off” where the
sensor algorithm would have detected sensors that did not function as intended and shut them
off.
