C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems, VITEK 2 Systems (PC) version 9.04
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
K213931 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Omadacycline has the following concentrations in the card: 0.5,
2, 8 and 16 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL).
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-GN card with Omadacycline was conducted at
three clinical sites using a panel of ten Gram-negative bacilli consistent with the indications for
use (i.e., eight K. pneumoniae pneumoniae, one K. pneumoniae and one E. cloacae isolates).
Each isolate was tested in triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. Inocula were
prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2
System. In addition, the inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method for use with the
VITEK 2 Compact. The mode of MIC values was determined for each isolate and the
reproducibility was calculated based on the number of MIC values that fell within ±1 doubling
dilution of the mode MIC value. The majority of data points were on-scale and within ± one
doubling dilution agreement as compared to the mode MIC. The data was analyzed taking into
consideration best-case and worst-case scenarios as described in the Class II Special Controls
Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. The reproducibility
performance is shown in Table 1.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The CLSI recommended QC strain, namely Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was tested a
sufficient number of times (i.e., at least 20/site) at each testing site using both the VITEK 2
AST-GN Omadacycline and Broth Microdilution (BMD) reference method. Both the
automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual
dilution method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact. The results are summarized in Table 2
below. Both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods for VITEK 2 and the manual
dilution for VITEK 2 Compact QC results were within the expected range >95% of the time,
which is acceptable.
Because the VITEK card reporting range (≤0.25 - ≥ 16 µg/mL) does not include the full
CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution range for QC testing, the sponsor included a footnote in
labeling to indicate that the device does not include the full CLSI/FDA-recommended
dilution range for QC testing.

Both the auto-dilution and the manual dilution methods for VITEK 2 and the manual dilution for
VITEK 2 Compact QC results were within the expected range >95% of the time, which is
acceptable.
Two ancillary quality control organisms were tested throughout comparative testing by broth
microdilution reference method only. This was done to perform further quality control of the
broth microdilution panels. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and
Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. QC results for the broth microdilution method were within
the expected result range >95% of the time. S. aureus ATCC 29213 was within range 100%
(207/207) and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 was within range 100% (206/206).
Inoculum Density Control:
The DensiCHEK Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a 0.5 McFarland standard. The
instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at each site. Calibration values were
within the expected range.
Purity Check:
A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to prepare the VITEK 2
card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in the study.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Testing of omadacycline on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card was performed at five
clinical sites. There were 371 (IFU and non-IFU) clinical isolates and 89 challenge isolates tested
for a total of 460 isolates. Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card with
omadacycline were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution (BMD)
reference panel. The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Omadacycline is
≤0.25 to ≥16 μg/mL for all species.
The testing conditions for the reference method consisted of the following:
• Medium: Mueller Hinton broth with the appropriate dilutions of antimicrobial solution added.
• Inoculum: Direct colony suspension
• Incubation: 35°C; 16-24 hours
K213931 - Page 7 of 12

--- Page 8 ---
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test inocula used
for the VITEK 2 AST cards were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 371 clinical isolates were evaluated at four sites: 59.3% were considered contemporary
isolates (isolated from clinical specimen and tested within 6 months) and 40.7% were stock
isolates. Complete test results were available for all clinical isolates from 330 indicated species:
300 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 27 Enterobacter cloacae, and 3 Enterobacter cloacae complex
isolates. Results were available from an additional 41 non-indicated clinical isolates and those
were as follows: 2 Citrobacter freundii, 3 Citrobacter koseri, 3 Enterobacter aerogenes, 27
Escherichia coli, 3 Klebsiella oxytoca, and 3 Serratia marcescens. All clinical isolates were
tested with the auto-dilution option of the VITEK 2.
A total of 89 challenge isolates were evaluated at one site. They included: 35 Enterobacter
cloacae, 5 Enterobacter cloacae complex, 7 Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumoniae, and 42
Klebsiella pneumoniae. The challenge set was tested with the auto-dilution and manual dilution
options of the VITEK 2 and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact.
Clinical and Challenge Data –VITEK 2 Auto-Dilution

The overall performance of K. pneumoniae is acceptable with an EA of 100% and a CA of
91.8% for the VITEK 2 System. There were no major or very major errors. While the
performance for the VITEK 2 Compact system was <90% for CA (89.8%), the EA was
100% and there were no major or very major errors. Taken together, the overall performance
of K. pneumoniae is acceptable for the VITEK 2 Compact system.
To address testing and reporting of non-indicated species, the following statement is included
in the Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.
Resistance Mechanism Characterization
Omadacycline was active in vitro against Enterobacteriaceae expressing the TetB efflux
pump and one K. pneumoniae challenge isolate expressing tet(B) was included in the
evaluation.

MIC Trends
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method for each indicated organism species (Table 7). This
trending calculation analyzes device MIC values that are determined to be one or more
doubling dilutions lower or higher than the reference method. MIC values that are off-scale
for both the reference and device are not considered in the trending analysis. Species for
which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher or lower MIC values was
≥30% with a statistically significant confidence interval were considered to have evidence of
trending.

A trend toward higher MIC values was observed for E. cloacae. The following footnote to
the performance table is included in the package insert to address the trending observed for
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Omadacycline:
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Omadacycline MIC values tended to be in exact agreement
or at least one doubling dilution higher when testing E. cloacae compared to the CLSI
reference broth microdilution method.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GN Omadacycline when revised breakpoints for
delafloxacin are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the
delafloxacin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
