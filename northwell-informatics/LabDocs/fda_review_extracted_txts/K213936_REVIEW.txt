III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The DiaSorin LIAISON MeMed BV is an automated in vitro diagnostic semi-quantitative assay
that uses chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) technology to measure three non-microbial
(host) proteins (TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP) in adult and pediatric serum samples and is intended
for use in conjunction with clinical assessments and other laboratory findings as an aid to
differentiate bacterial from viral infection. The LIAISON MeMed BV assay is indicated for use
in patients presenting to the emergency department or urgent care center and with samples
collected at hospital admission from patients with suspected acute bacterial or viral infection,
who have had symptoms for seven days or less. The LIAISON MeMed BV assay generates a
numeric score that falls within discrete interpretation ranges based on the increasing likelihood
of bacterial infection. The assay has to be performed on the automated LIAISON XL Analyzer.
The DiaSorin LIAISON MeMed BV Control Set is intended for use as assayed quality control to
monitor the performance of the DiaSorin LIAISON MeMed BV assay. The performance
characteristics of the LIAISON controls have not been established for any other assays or
instrument platforms different from the automated LIAISON Analyzer family. The control set is
intended for in vitro diagnostic use in a professional laboratory only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The LIAISON MeMed BV Assay is performed on the LIAISON XL Analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The LIAISON MeMed BV assay is an in vitro diagnostic device that measures in parallel the
blood concentrations of TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP. The test consists of an automated analyzer that
conducts chemiluminescence-based analyte measurements of patient serum samples and their
computational integration. Reagents are provided in individual compartments within a plastic
container called the Reagent Integral. The assembled kit includes one each of the TRAIL
Reagent Integral, IP-10 Reagent Integral, CRP Reagent Integral and two levels of calibrators for
each specific assay. The assay configuration allows for the performance of 100 tests.
The LIAISON MeMed BV Control Set is quality control material that is available for purchase
separately and that consists of two vials each of two control levels (viral and bacterial) provided
lyophilized. The volume of each vial is sufficient for at least 10 determinations. The LIAISON
K213936 - Page 2 of 22

--- Page 3 ---
MeMed BV Control Set is intended to monitor for substantial reagent failure. The controls
should be evaluated on each day of testing or as required by guidelines or requirements of local
regulations or accredited organizations.
B Principle of Operation:
The LIAISON MeMed BV assay consists of three individual chemiluminescence immunoassays
(CLIAs) for quantitative determination of TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP. All three reagent packs must
be the same lot and present at the same time on the same instrument used for sample testing. All
three reagent packs are individually calibrated and quality controlled.
Each individual reagent pack for TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP utilizes monoclonal antibodies for
capture and antibody-conjugates for the detection of the specific assay target. The assay
incubates sample, calibrator, or control with assay buffer and paramagnetic particles coated with
a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the target of interest. Following the
incubation, an isoluminol conjugated antibody specific for each analyte is then added to the
reaction and incubated. The unbound conjugate is removed with a wash step. Starter reagents are
then added and a flash chemiluminescent reaction is initiated. The light signal is measured by a
photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is proportional to the concentration of analyte
present in the calibrators, controls or samples.
The LIAISON MeMed BV test result is a score between 0 and 100 derived from computational
integration of the measurements of the three proteins TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP, where low scores
are indicative of viral infection and high score of bacterial infection.
• 0 ≤ score ≤10: High likelihood of viral infection (or other non-bacterial etiology)
• 10 < score <35: Moderate likelihood of viral infection (or other non-bacterial etiology)
• 35 ≤ score ≤65: Equivocal
• 65 < score <90: Moderate likelihood of bacterial infection (or co-infection)
• 90 ≤ score ≤100: High likelihood of bacterial infection (or co-infection)
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
LIAISON XL Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
The LIAISON MeMed BV test is intended to be performed on human serum specimens To
prevent confusion, a distinct identification number must be assigned to every sample in the
LIAISON XL software. This sample ID can be entered either by scanning the bar-code using
the barcode scanner located in the loading bay for sample racks or typing it manually.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
K213936 - Page 3 of 22

--- Page 4 ---
The loading bay for sample racks allows continuous loading of the LIAISON XL system
with samples. The samples in the tubes are placed in special racks and loaded in one of the
10 lanes afterwards. As support, a LED below each lane indicates the relevant usage status.
4. Calibration:
Two point kit calibrators specific to each Reagent Integral lot are used to establish specific
working curves for each of the three assays based on assay master curves stored on the
analyzer. In order to correctly run the test, the TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP Reagent Integrals
must be calibrated.
Calibration is required every 21 days, or
• With each new lot of reagents (Reagent Integral or Starter Reagents)
• If Quality Control results are out of the acceptable range
• After each servicing of the LIAISON XL Analyzer
5. Quality Control:
The LIAISON MeMed BV Controls are representative of patient specimens intended for use
with the LIAISON MeMed BV assay. Control 1 represents a low viral score and Control 2
represents a high bacterial score.

technicians for a total of 80 replicates per panel member. The test days spanned two
calibration cycles. The test panel included the LIAISON MeMed BV Control set (Control 1
and Control 2 with two levels containing three analytes) and four serum specimens. Three of
the serum specimens were contrived by spiking neat serum to generate target SCORE values
that correspond to one viral (Low Score), one bacterial (High Score), and one equivocal
assay (Medium Score) result. The final serum specimen was a native patient sample (Native)
that corresponded to a low (viral/non-infectious) score.

1IP-10 values for the Native Panel Member were below the assay measuring range.
2. Linearity:
A study was performed to assess the linearity of measurement for each of the three
measurands (TRAIL/IP-10/CRP) with acceptance criteria for bias due to non-linearity of less
than 15%. Linearity is not applicable to the test result (Score), as it is calculated using a pre-
defined weighted multinomial logistic regression model. Serial dilutions of specimens
containing high levels of each analyte were evaluated on the LIAISON MeMed BV Test.
Specifically, two serum specimens (CRP and IP-10) and a high-concentration buffer spiked
sample (TRAIL), were diluted to prepare a dilution series that spanned the relevant
measuring range for each analyte (15-300 pg/mL for TRAIL, 100-2000 pg/mL for IP-10, and
1-250 mg/L for CRP). Linearity for each of the MeMed BV measurands fell within the
acceptance criteria with no deviations above 5.5% observed throughout the relevant range for
all analytes.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
An interference study was performed to evaluate the impact of select interferents and cross-
reactants on the test score. Performance in the presence of potentially interfering substances
was evaluated using two serum samples, one that corresponded to a low score value (5) and
one that corresponded to a high score value (95). Each sample was divided into equal

These results demonstrate that the presence of the evaluated exogenous and endogenous
interferants do not significantly impact the LIAISON MeMed BV Score values.
Additional interference testing was performed to establish whether the presence of human
anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) interfere with LIAISON MeMed BV assay results. Potential
HAMA interference was assessed by evaluating three independent clinical samples that each
contained HAMA levels varying from 316 to >600 ng/mL as determined by a sample vendor
certificate of analysis. Samples were tested both before and after processing with heterophilic
blocking tubes to remove HAMA. Results from testing are displayed below.

The observed difference in Score for each HAMA sample met acceptance criteria of less than
12.5 score units and indicate a low likelihood of specimens shifting to a non-adjacent bin.
Additional interference testing was performed to determine whether the presence of
rheumatoid factor interferes with the LIAISON MeMed BV assay results. Again, two serum
samples including one low Score (5) and one high score (95) were divided into equal aliquots
and spiked with high RF Concentrations. Results are displayed in the table below.

Hook Effect Study
A study was performed to evaluate whether a high dose hook effect occurs in samples
containing high amounts of analyte. Samples containing analyte levels above the upper end
of the analytical measuring range were evaluated using one reagent lot. All samples
demonstrated an increasing amount of chemiluminescence with increasing concentration of
analyte. No hook effect was observed for TRAil up to 1,000 pg/mL, IP-10 up to 10,000
pg/mL, and CRP up to 500 mg/L.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Calibration
The LIAISON MeMed BV assay consists of three separate reagent integrals, TRAIL, IP-10,
and CRP that generate a continuous response (relative light units, RLU) which is used in
sample grading to provide a reportable quantitative result. Sample grading is based on the use
of a calibration curve referenced to ‘In-house’ TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP reference standards
(master standards). Each calibration curve (master curve) is controlled by the use of two
lyophilized calibrators (Calibrator 1 and Calibrator 2) provided with the Reagent Integral.
Calibrator 1 and 2 are assayed by the user to transform the master curve into a working curve
and further used to calculate sample results. The LIAISON XL Analyzer working curve is
obtained by the user during assay calibration by assigning a curve to the two point kit
calibrators based upon the master curve. This working curve is used to calculate the patient
sample results.
Recalibration in triplicate is mandatory whenever at least one of the following conditions
occurs: new lot of reagents are being used, previous calibration was performed more than 21
days prior, quality control results are out of the acceptable range, or the analyzer has been
serviced.

Controls
The LIAISON MeMed BV Controls are representative of patient specimens intended for use
with the LIAISON MeMed BV assay. Control 1 represents a low viral score specimen and
control 2 represents a high bacterial score specimen. The range of concentrations for each
analyte present in each control is reported on the certificate of analysis and indicates the
limits established by DiaSorin for control values that can be obtained in reliable assay runs.
Specimen Stability
Several studies were performed to assess stability of serum samples exposed to different
storage conditions.
To demonstrate room temperature sample storage stability, five serum samples that spanned
the entire LIAISON MeMed BV score range were aliquoted and stored at 22°C across
several timepoints before being tested in duplicate on the LIAISON MeMed BV assay. Mean
values were calculated for each sample and mean percent differences from the baseline were
evaluated by linear regression to demonstrate a deviation of less than 10% from samples at
baseline. The study data support a room temperature sample stability claim of three hours.
To demonstrate refrigerated sample storage stability, five serum samples spanning the entire
LIAISON MeMed BV score range were aliquoted and stored at 2-8°C. Mean values were
plotted and evaluated over several timepoints to demonstrate a deviation of less than 10%
from baseline. These study data support a refrigerated sample storage claim of eight hours.
To demonstrate frozen sample storage stability, five serum samples that spanned the entire
range of the LIAISON MeMed BV assay were aliquoted and stored at both -20°C and -70°C
before being tested in duplicate. Mean values were calculated for each sample and mean
percent differences from the baseline were evaluated by linear regression to demonstrate a
deviation of less than 10% from samples at baseline. Data from these studies support a frozen
sample storage claim of four weeks at -20°C or-70°C.
Freeze/Thaw Stability
To evaluate the effect of freeze-thawing serum samples on the LIAISON MeMed BV assay
results, five serum samples that spanned the entire LIAISON MeMed BV score range were
aliquoted, frozen, and thawed for up to five freeze/thaw cycles before being tested in
triplicate on the LIAISON MeMed BV assay. Mean values for each sample were evaluated at
each time point and analyzed via linear regression to determine the point at which a 10% or
greater deviation from baseline occurs. Results from these studies demonstrate sample
stability for up to three freeze/thaw cycles.
Stability of LIAISON MeMed BV Calibrators
Stability of reconstituted calibrators for the LIAISON MeMed BV assay were evaluated
across multiple storage conditions: room temperature on board the LIAISON XL instrument,
refrigerated at 2-8°C, and frozen at -20°C. Performance was evaluated by re-calibrating the
assay with the reconstituted calibrators at designated intervals. Samples tested included
unexpired kit controls and four internal controls that spanned the LIAISON MeMed BV
K213936 - Page 14 of 22

--- Page 15 ---
Score range. Results from these stability studies support storage of controls at room
temperature for 48 hours, refrigerated for up to four weeks, and frozen for up to 8 weeks.
Additionally, calibrator stability was demonstrated for up to 4 freeze/thaw cycles.
Stability of LIAISON MeMed BV Controls
Stability of reconstituted LIAISON MeMed BV controls was evaluated using two lots of
control materials across multiple storage conditions: room temperature on board the
LIAISON XL instrument, refrigerated at 2-8°C, and frozen at -20°C. Controls were evaluated
in triplicate at designated intervals after storage. Mean values were analyzed via linear
regression to identify the point where deviation greater than 10% occurs. Results from these
studies demonstrate control stability for up to 72 hours at room temperature, eight weeks
when refrigerated, and eight weeks when stored frozen. Additionally, stability of the
LIAISON MeMed BC controls were also demonstrated for up to four freeze/thaw cycles.
Fresh vs. Frozen Study
A study was conducted to establish that fresh and frozen serum samples are equivalent and
can be used interchangeably in the assay. Forty-three fresh serum samples were collected
from patients and spiked with recombinant TRAIL, IP-10, and/or CRP to span the entire
range of the LIAISON MeMed BV Score. Samples were tested fresh in triplicate and then
frozen, thawed, and tested again in triplicate. Sample results were analyzed by Passing
Bablock regression with overall acceptance criteria for the study requiring a slope 0.9-1.1
and R2 ≥ 0.9. Results for all individual analytes and Score values met the acceptance criteria
and establish equivalent assay results for both fresh and frozen specimens.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank
Five blank samples were tested on the LIAISON MeMed BV assay on one analyzer, with
two reagent lots and two technicians over six runs. Testing spanned three days and included 2
replicates per run for a total of 60 results per reagent lot. LoB was calculated as described in
CLSI EP17-A2. Results are summarized in the table below.

Four samples containing low levels of CRP, IP-10, and TRAIL were evaluated on the
LIAISON MeMed BC assay on one analyzer, with two reagent lots and two technicians over
six runs. Testing spanned three days and included 2 replicates per run for a minimum of 96
dose results. LoD was calculated as described in CLSI EP17-A2. Results are summarized in
the table below.

Concentration 0.037 0.067 3.8 4.31 7.03 5.05
The overall assay LoD for each analyte was defined as the higher of the two kit lots (0.067
mg/L for CRP, 4.31 pg/mL for IP-10, and 7.03 pg/mL for TRAIL).
Limit of Quantitation
Seven serum samples for CRP, seven serum and/or spiked matrix samples for TRAIL and
eight serum samples for IP-10 containing low concentrations of each analyte were evaluated
to determine the assay limit of quantitation as described in CLSI EP17-A2. The % CV for
each individual sample was plotted against the mean dose result and a best fit curve was
applied to determine when the regression line crossed the 20% CV threshold. The assay LoQ
for each analyte was defined as the higher of the two kit lots. LoQ for the LIAISON MeMed
BV test was identified as 1.0 mg/L for CRP, 100 pg/mL for IP-10, and 15 pg/mL for TRAIL.
When one of the three proteins (CRP, IP-10 and TRAIL) is detected below the respective
assay LoQ or above the assay specific maximum measurable value, the LoQ value or the
maximum is used as the input into the formula.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Clinical validation for the LIAISON MeMed BV assay was performed utilizing a subset of
samples used to support clearance of the predicate MeMed BV assay (K210254). Briefly,
samples were collected in a multicenter, observational, blinded study (Apollo,
Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04690569) across 11 medical centers (9 in the US and 2 in
Israel). The study population included hospital admitted, Emergency Department (ED) and
Urgent Care patients with suspected acute bacterial or viral infections.

The primary analysis of the complete clinical study cohort established the diagnostic
performance for differentiating bacterial from viral infection in patients with suspected acute
bacterial or viral infection using forced expert adjudication as the comparator method (in
which physicians were forced to make a bacterial, viral, or noninfectious diagnosis with
categorization of patients as indeterminate not allowed). In this analysis, experts were
blinded to both C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) values. A secondary
analysis was also performed using consensus expert adjudication as a comparator method (in
which indeterminate cases were removed from analysis and with the experts given CRP and
PCT values). Data from the secondary objective is also presented below and should be
considered supplementary information.
A subset of the original Apollo study cohort consisting of 300 samples (delinked and de-
identified specimen aliquots) was utilized to demonstrate equivalent clinical performance of
the LIAISON MeMed BV test. Fifteen specimens were not evaluated due to sample integrity
errors on the LIAISON XL Anlayzer due to low serum volume which precluded the
possibility of repeat testing. Of the remaining 285 subjects considered, 51 resided in Israel
and 234 in the U.S. Age, gender, ethnicity and racial diversity are summarized in Table 9
below.

A significant trend was demonstrated between the LIAISON MeMed BV Score and
increasing likelihood of bacterial infection across Score bins. Additionally, individuals with
Scores in the lowest bin have a high likelihood of viral or non-bacterial etiology and the
individuals with scores in the highest bin have a high likelihood of bacterial infection. To
further demonstrate equivalent performance to the predicate device, a similar analysis was
performed for the predicate device results on the same clinical samples evaluated as part of
this study.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Predictive values depend on the likelihood ratios and the prevalence of disease. Laboratories and
other users should establish their own reference intervals for their patient populations using the
LIAISON MeMed BV test to reflect potential sources of variability, such as patient gender, race,
or age.
To assess the expected reference range for the LIAISON MeMed BV assay, serum samples from
150 apparently healthy asymptomatic adults were collected and evaluated on a single lot of
LIAISON MeMed BV reagents. Study subjects were 65% female and 35% male and ranged in
age from 21-71.
