III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tubes and BD Vacutainer® Trace Element K EDTA
2
Tubes are plastic, evacuated, sterile, single use, in vitro diagnostic medical devices. They are
intended to be used in settings where venous blood specimens are collected by trained healthcare
professionals for the collection, transportation, and processing of blood in a closed tube. Blood
collected in the BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tubes and BD Vacutainer® Trace
Element K EDTA Tubes are used for trace element testing (e.g., Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium,
2
Copper, Lead, Manganese, Mercury, Selenium, and Zinc).
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Tubes have not been evaluated for other testing applications
which use serum or EDTA anticoagulated blood.
BD Vacutainer® Trace Element tubes are controlled only for the trace elements listed within their
respective upper limits. Other trace elements may be present, however, these levels have not
been evaluated and are not controlled. Users should assess whether the use of these tubes is
appropriate for their intended testing purposes.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BD Vacutainer® Trace Element K EDTA Tube is a sterile, plastic, evacuated plastic blood
2
collection tube. It consists of closure assembly, a plastic tube, and K EDTA coating and is
2
available in two draw sizes, 6 mL (13 x 100 mm) and 3 mL (13 x 75 mm). The plastic tube is
manufactured from PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic. The K EDTA anticoagulant coating
2
is spray-dried on the walls of the tube.
The BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tube is a sterile, plastic, evacuated plastic blood
collection tube consisting of a closure assembly, a plastic tube and contains a silica clot activator
additive which is spray-dried on the interior walls of the tube. It is available in one draw size, 6
mL (13 x 100 mm). The plastic tube is manufactured from PET.
Both types of tubes are closed with a BD Hemogard™ Closure, which consists of a rubber
stopper and protective plastic shield to help reduce user exposure to blood. The stopper/closures
K213953 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
are color coded in royal blue to reflect that the tubes are intended to collect samples for trace
element.
B Principle of Operation:
The BD Vacutainer® Trace Element K EDTA and BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum tubes
2
use controlled vacuum to pull a specific volume of blood into the sterile interior of the tube.
Within the serum tube, silica clot activator serves to enhance clot activation of the blood, thus
rendering serum samples for trace element testing. The other tube contains K EDTA, which
2
prevents blood coagulation, thus rendering whole blood or plasma samples for trace element
testing.
The tubes are compatible with BD Vacutainer® Blood Collection Needles, Blood Collection Sets,
Transfer Devices, Holders and Adapters. Once the vein of the patient has been penetrated using a
standard needle, the collection tube is centered in the holder and pushed onto the needle,
puncturing the stopper of the tube. Immediately after the blood has been drawn, the tube is gently
inverted 8-10 times for K EDTA and 8 times for serum to mix the blood with the additive. For
2
the serum tubes, blood should be allowed to clot for a minimum of 60 minutes before
centrifugation, The recommended centrifugation conditions are 1300 RCF (relative centrifuge
force or g) for 10 minutes.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A study was conducted to evaluate BD Vacutainer® Trace Element K EDTA Tubes (6 mL)
2
and BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tubes (6 mL) for repeatability (within tube) and
reproducibility (lot to lot and tube to tube) performance using lead and zinc as representative
trace elements for testing. Two sample matrices, including serum (for zinc testing) and
anticoagulated whole blood (for lead testing), were evaluated on two instrument platforms
for Zinc and one platform for Lead to confirm tube performance. Three lots of each of the
evaluation tubes (BD Vacutainer® Trace Element K EDTA Tubes and BD Vacutainer® Trace
2
Element Serum Tubes) were evaluated.
The first study (whole blood lead testing) was performed using samples collected from 35
subjects. The second study (serum zinc testing) was performed using samples collected from
43 subjects.
K213953 - Page 5 of 10

K EDTA Tubes are stable for 10 months, when stored at 4°C to 25 °C. Stability study
2
protocol and acceptance criteria has been reviewed and found to be acceptable.
b) Analyte stability:
Multiple analyte stability studies were conducted to assess the analyte within tube
stability for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Mn, Se and Zn in BD Vacutainer® Trace Element
K EDTA Tubes and BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tubes. Stability studies were
2
assessed at initial time (Time 0) and 24 hrs at room temperature storage (for As, Cd, Cr,
Cu, Hg, Pb, Mn, Se) and 4 hrs at room temperature storage (Zn).
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim, the within-tube stability was
demonstrated in the BD Vacutainer® Trace Element K EDTA Tubes and BD Vacutainer®
2
Trace Element Serum Tubes for up to 24 hrs at room temperature storage for As, Cd, Cr,
Cu, Hg, Pb, Mn, Se and up to 4 hrs at room temperature storage for Zn.
c) Clinical Transportation Study:
A study was conducted to assess the analyte within tube stability for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg,
Pb, Mn, Se and Zn when exposed to simulated transportation conditions and worst-case
room temperature. Conditions evaluated included:
- Exposure to vibration and impact simulations that replicate the vibratory and impact
loadings which a small parcel (e.g., small box) is expected to experience when
shipped via a parcel carrier.
- Exposure to the upper limit of the labeled temperature of 25°C.
The results of the study support that the tubes can be used to transport venous blood
sample when subjected to the drop, vibration, temperature and humidity conditions used
in this test method. Study protocols and acceptance criteria have been reviewed, and
performance was considered acceptable.
d) Additional Bench Testing on the Candidate Device:
Due to an administrative error, the packaging performance study in the section below was
previously redacted and is now included:
Benchtop studies were conducted to assess draw volume, X-value, 2nd stopper pullout,
stopper/shield separation, stopper leakage, tube leakage, breakage resistance during drop
testing, breakage resistance during centrifugation testing, packaging performance and the
trace metal content prior to blood draw. The study protocols were reviewed, and
performance was considered acceptable.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A study was conducted to evaluate the Clinical Equivalence of BD Vacutainer® Trace
Element Blood Collection Tubes (BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum and K EDTA) in
2
comparison with Greiner Bio-One Vacuette® Trace Element Blood Collection Tubes
(Greiner Bio-One Vacuette® Trace Element Serum and Sodium Heparin) for testing trace
elements.
A total of`159 subjects were enrolled in the study across several study parts. All samples
were collected by routine venipuncture into the corresponding candidate tube and also in no
additive tubes that were used for the preparation of the contrived samples to obtain results for
high levels of trace elements that spanned the analytical measurement range.
Immediately after collection and prior to centrifugation, tubes were inspected for complete
fill, clot formation and stopper leakage. After centrifugation, additional visual assessments
were performed. Tubes were then handled and processed according to manufacturer’s
recommended handling conditions for tube inversions and centrifugation time and force.
The following tube comparisons were performed for clinical equivalence:
▪ 6 mL BD Trace Element K EDTA vs 6 mL Greiner Trace Element NaHep
2
▪ 6 mL BD Trace Element Serum vs 6 mL Greiner Trace Element Serum
▪ 3 mL BD Trace Element K EDTA vs 6 mL Greiner Trace Element NaHep
2
▪ 3 mL BD Trace Element K EDTA vs 6 mL BD Trace Element K EDTA
2 2
Samples collected in the BD Trace Element K EDTA were analyzed on one ICP-MS
2
instrument platform for testing As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Mn, Hg and Se in anticoagulated whole blood
and samples collected in the BD Trace Element Serum were tested for Cr, Cu, Mn, Se and Zn
in serum. Biases between tube types at pre-determined medical decision points were
estimated with 95% intervals. The mean biases and 95% limit were compared to the
clinically acceptable limit (CAL). Data was analyzed using Passing Bablok regression .
