Nucleic acids from the viral and bacterial organisms identified by this test are generally
detectable in NPS specimens during the acute phase of infection. The detection and identification
of specific viral and bacterial nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and/or symptoms of
respiratory infection are indicative of the presence of the identified microorganism and aids in
diagnosis if used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information, and
laboratory findings. The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis,
treatment, or other patient management decisions.
Negative results in the setting of a respiratory illness may be due to infection with pathogens that
are not detected by this test, or lower respiratory tract infection that may not be detected by an
NPS specimen. Positive results do not rule out coinfection with other organisms. The agent(s)
detected by the SPOTFIRE R Panel may not be the definite cause of disease.
Additional laboratory testing (e.g., bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence, and
radiography) may be necessary when evaluating a patient with possible respiratory tract
infection.

D Special Instrument Requirements:
BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Respiratory (R) Panel (SPOTFIRE R Panel) is a multiplexed
nucleic acid-amplification-based test that is intended to detect and identify 13 different
respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens from
individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection. The SPOTFIRE R Panel
is performed on the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System, an automated polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-based in vitro diagnostic system for use with reagent pouches for specific
indications.
The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System automates nucleic acid extraction and nested multiplex
PCR in closed system. The resulting PCR products are evaluated using assay-specific DNA
melting analysis. The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System Software executes the SPOTFIRE R
Panel test and interprets and reports the test results in approximately 15 minutes without
user intervention.
The SPOTFIRE System is comprised of between one and four modules that are connected
to a single SPOTFIRE Control Station equipped with the SPOTFIRE System Software.
The first module is placed on top of the Control Station and up to three additional modules
may be stacked on top as required. Each module can be accessed at random to perform a
test, independent of the other modules attached to the same Control Station.
The SPOTFIRE R Panel Reagent Kit includes the following components:

B Principle of Operation:
The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Panel Pouch is a closed-system disposable that contains all the
reagents needed for sample preparation, reverse transcription, PCR amplification and
fluorescent detection, including melt curve analysis of amplified products. The rigid plastic
“fitment” of the pouch contains reagents in freeze-dried form while the flexible plastic
portion of the pouch is divided into discrete “blisters” in which different chemical
processes are carried out. After sample collection, the user injects hydration solution and
the sample combined with BIOFIRE Sample Buffer into the pouch, places the pouch into
the SPOTFIRE System, and starts the run. All other operations are automated.
The SPOTFIRE System Software is designed to run on the SPOTFIRE Control Station
which consists of an integrated computer and touchscreen. The SPOTFIRE Systems
Software interfaces with the user via the touchscreen to operate the instrument, collect,
save, analyze and retrieve data, report test results and view stored information. Meanwhile
the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel Software works with the System Software and specifies
the assay-specific parameters to perform the test, interpret the data and display the reported
results.
To perform a test with SPOTFIRE R Panel, the sample is first mixed with a denaturing Sample
Buffer to inactivate nucleases. The user then loads the diluted sample into the SPOTFIRE R
Panel Pouch via the injection port. The vacuum in the pouch draws the liquid into the sample
well of the pouch fitment and in the process rehydrates the cell-based Process Control. The
sample mixture is moved to the lysis blister where mechanical agitation with zirconia-silica
beads is used to complete cell lysis. The lysate is then mixed with glass-coated magnetic beads
which adsorb the nucleic acids liberated in the lysis step. The extracted nucleic acids are washed
to remove potential inhibitors and then eluted into buffer that is used to rehydrate the contents of
the first stage PCR blister, which includes all the components needed for reverse transcription
(RT) and first stage PCR. RT-PCR is initiated upon achievement of the requisite temperature
within the amplification chamber. Following completion of first-stage amplification, the products
of the reaction are diluted and combined with fresh reagents that are distributed over a second
stage PCR array. The second stage primers are internal (“nested”) with respect to the first stage
primers and each analyte or control target is represented by three discrete amplification reactions.
The second stage PCR array includes an assay control, the PCR2 Control, failure of which
indicates a failure in the second stage PCR and invalidates the run.

Included in the PCR master mix for the second stage PCR is a fluorescent dye (LC Green Plus)
that is specific for double-stranded DNA. The dye intercalates with the double stranded-PCR
products and fluoresces at a specific wavelength that is detected by the SPOTFIRE System. At
the end of the second stage PCR, the temperature of the array is gradually raised at a controlled
ramp rate and the fluorescence is monitored. Fluorescence decreases at the melting temperature
of the amplicons, and the temperature at which this occurs is characteristic of each amplification
product. The software automatically evaluates the calculated melting temperature (Tm) in
comparison to the predefined range for each specific analyte. The results from each of the three
amplification reactions for each analyte are combined by the software to determine the test
result. For an assay to be called positive, at least two of the three wells must have a PCR product
with a Tm that is within the specified range for that analyte. Assays that do not meet these
criteria are reported as negative.
Positive and negative results for the assay controls (Process Control and PCR2 Control) are
compared to their expected values and assigned a “pass” or “fail” result. Panel-specific rules
define how control failures affect interpretation of test results. For the SPOTFIRE R Panel,
failure of either the RNA Process Control or PCR2 Control invalidates the results for all
analytes. The final sample result is determined by the interpretation rules defined in the panel
software.
For most bacteria and viruses detected by the SPOTFIRE R Panel, a “positive” result is reported
if two or more of the wells corresponding to a single assay contain detectable PCR product of the
appropriate Tm. However, to ensure inclusivity, certain analytes are targeted by multiple assays,
the results of which are interpreted in combination, as described below in Tables 1 and 2.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Use of the SPOTFIRE R Panel requires a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) to be collected
according to standard procedures and placed in 1-3 mL of viral transport medium. The
minimum sample volume required to perform a test is 300 µL. Specimens should be tested as
soon as possible following collection but may be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature
(15-25 °C) or for up to 3 days at 2-8 °C or up to 30 days at ≤ -15 °C.
The SPOTFIRE System Software includes step-by-step on-screen instructions that guide the
user through the process of starting a run on the instrument. After cleaning the work area and
Pouch Loading Station, the user removes a SPOTFIRE R Panel pouch from its vacuum
packaging and places it into the Pouch Loading Station. They then hydrate the pouch using
the Hydration Injection Vial by injecting the contents through the Hydration Solution
Injection Port, after which they transfer a fixed volume of sample to the Sample Injection
Vial, together with the entire contents of the Sample Buffer ampoule. After mixing the
Sample Injection Vial by invertion, the user injects the mixture into the pouch via the Sample
Injection Port. The pouch is then inserted in the SPOTFIRE instrument, after which the run
starts automatically and proceeds to completion without further user intervention, including
interpretation of results.
4. Calibration:
The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System is factory calibrated. User calibration is not required.
5. Quality Control:
Internal Controls
Two process controls are included in each SPOTFIRE R Panel pouch:
1) RNA Process Control
The RNA Process Control comprises freeze-dried Schizosaccharomyces pombe which
is rehydrated when the sample is loaded. The control material is carried through all
stages of the test process, including nucleic acid extraction and purification, reverse
transcription, first and second stage PCR amplification and DNA melt analysis. A
positive result indicates that all process steps carried out in the SPOTFIRE R Panel
pouch were completed successfully.
2) PCR2 Control
The PCR2 control comprises a DNA target sequence that is dried into specific wells
used for the second stage amplification and melting curve analysis. A positive result
indicates that these processes were successful.
A positive result is required for both the RNA Process Control and the PCR2 Control for the
results for an individual pouch to be considered valid. If either control fails, the sample
should be retested using a new pouch.

External Controls
BIOFIRE recommends testing External Positive and Negative Controls that are commercially
available from Maine Molecular Quality Controls, Inc. when training a new operator, or
when a new shipment of SPOTFIRE panels or a new control station is received:
• SPOTFIRE RSP Positive Control (M42638)
• SPOTFIRE RSP Negative Control (M42738)
These controls are designed to monitor the performance of each of the individual assays
within the SPOTFIRE R Panel and should be tested in accordance with their FDA-cleared
Instructions For Use (K221253).
The Instructions For Use of the SPOTFIRE R Panel indicate that an External Negative
Control should be tested at least monthly to monitor for environmental contamination.
Additional External Controls may be tested as needed.
External Positive and Negative Controls were tested during the Prospective Clinical Study
described in Section VII (C). In total, 252 External Controls were tested of which 8 were
associated with instrument errors, 4 were tested using an incorrect version of the reagent
pouch and 4 were tested using the workflow for patient samples rather than Quality Control.
As a result, there were 236 External Controls with valid results (109 Positive and 131
Negative). Of these, 99.1% of the External Positive Controls (108/109) and 100% of the
External Negative Controls (131/131) produced the expected results.

clinical and
epidemiological
information. The results of
this test should not be used
as the sole basis for
diagnosis, treatment, or
other patient management
decisions.
Negative results in the
setting of a respiratory
illness may be due to
infection with pathogens
that are not detected by this
test, or lower respiratory
tract infection that may not
be detected by an NPS
specimen. Positive results
do not rule out coinfection
with other organisms. The
agent(s) detected by the
BIOFIRE RP2.1 may not be
the definite cause of
disease. Additional
laboratory testing (e.g.
bacterial and viral culture,
immunofluorescence, and
radiography) may be
necessary when evaluating

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility and precision of the SPOTFIRE R Panel on different BIOFIRE
SPOTFIRE Systems was evaluated with multiple operators who tested positive and negative
samples over multiple days at three study sites, in addition to BIOFIRE Diagnostics. All
analytes detected by the panel were evaluated using contrived positive specimens at
concentrations equivalent to ≤ 3X their respective analytical limit of detection (LoD) (Table
3). Negative samples were prepared using artificial matrix only.

At BIOFIRE Diagnostics, testing was performed on three SPOTFIRE Systems, using three
lots of reagents over five consecutive days. On each day of testing, two operators each tested
three replicates of each sample (one per reagent lot) on each SPOTFIRE System for a total of
90 replicates per sample overall (2 operators x 3 samples x 3 instruments x 5 days = 90
replicates).
At the external study sites, testing was performed with a single SPOTFIRE System at each
site and occurred over five non-consecutive days using a single lot of reagents that was
common across each of the sites. On each day, two operators each tested two replicates of
each sample for a total of 60 replicates per sample overall (2 operators x 2 samples x 3 sites x
5 days = 60 replicates).

For each analyte there were 150 positive and 600 negative samples. Samples that produced
an invalid result on initial testing due to process control failure (n = 12) or instrument error (n
= 2) were retested. Precision and reproducibility for each analyte were calculated by
assessing the agreement between the reported test results and the expected results for each
sample.
A summary of the results of the study, stratified by analyte and SPOTFIRE system/site is
provided in Table 4. Positive agreement for all analytes was > 95% and there was negligible
difference between instruments, sites, reagent lots or operators. Negative agreement was
100% in all cases.
Overall, the reproducibility and precision of the SPOTFIRE R Panel for detection of the
target analytes was determined to be acceptable.

1 1 positive sample was initially reported as Positive: Influenza A Virus (No Subtype Identified) and was therefore
re-tested. The re-test result was as expected. The retest results from this sample for each analyte are included in
the summary table.
2 2 positive samples were initially reported as Positive: Influenza A Virus (No Subtype Identified) and 1 positive
sample was initially reported as Uncertain: Influenza A Virus. All 3 samples were retested and the retest results
were as expected. The retest results from these samples for each analyte are included in the summary table.
3 1 sample was reported as Uncertain Influenza A Virus but was not retested.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity (exclusivity) of the SPOTFIRE R Panel was evaluated through a
combination of in silico analysis and laboratory testing of on- and off-panel species,
phylogenetically related viruses and bacteria and other microorganisms that may be found in
the respiratory tract.
In silico Analysis of Specificity (Exclusivity)
In silico analysis of assay specificity/exclusivity was performed by conducting searches with
whole amplicon and paired inner primer sequences using the NCBI BLAST “blastn” tool.
The location and orientation of regions of homology with the primer sequences were
evaluated to determine the potential for amplification. A summary of the results from the
analysis is provided in Table 5. The SPOTFIRE R Panel assays were shown to be specific
for their respective analytes with the following exceptions, which are noted in the device
labeling:
• Cross-reaction of the SARS-CoV-2 assays with closely related bat and pangolin
coronavirus sequences
• Cross-reaction of the Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus assay with B. pertussis, B.
parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica, in addition to bovine and canine picornaviruses

1 Certain avian H1N2 sequences (AY233393 and AY038014) may also be detected and reported as H1-2009
Note: A sequence from Protopolystoma xenopodis (a parasitic worm found in frogs) exhibited significant homology
to the pan-influenza A PCR primers and may be amplified but this organism is of no clinical relevance
Laboratory Testing of Analytical Specificity
The analytical specificity (exclusivity) of the SPOTFIRE R Panel was also evaluated by
testing high concentrations of on- and off-panel viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms
that are phylogenetically related or may be found in nasopharyngeal and throat swab
specimens. Analysis of on-panel analytes was performed to evaluate the potential for intra-
panel cross-reactivity (i.e., detection of an analyte by an assay other than the target-specific
assay for that analyte). Analysis of off-panel analytes was performed to evaluate the potential
for cross-reaction with other respiratory flora that are not detected by the panel.
Each on-panel species was tested in triplicate and the results are shown in Tables 6 and 7.
The expected results were obtained with each on-panel virus and no cross-reaction was
observed (Table 6). Based on in silico analysis, it was predicted that B. parapertussis and B.
pertussis would produce positive results with the Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus assay. B.
pertussis produced false-positive results at 1.3 x 1010 CFU/mL but was reported negative
when tested at 1.3 x 109 CFU/mL (Table 7). False-positive results were not observed with B.

1 In silico analysis predicted detection by the Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus assay but none was observed
2 Cross-reaction also predicted by in silico analysis
The potential for cross-reaction with off-panel analytes was evaluated by testing 87 stains of
of bacteria, 2 species of fungus and 7 viruses that are either phylogenetically related to the
on-panel analytes or which are commonly found in the respiratory tract (Table 8). No cross-
reaction was observed other than the detection of one strain of B. bronchiseptica by the assay
for B. parapertussis that was predicted by in silico analysis.

1 B. bronchiseptica NRRL B-59909 carries IS1001 which is the target for the SPOTFIRE R Panel B. parapertussis
assay. Positive results were obtained with all target levels ≥ 28 cells/mL and with 1/3 replicates at 2.8 cells/mL.
Based on a combination of the in silico and laboratory testing data, the potential for cross-
reaction of the SPOTFIRE R Panel with certain on- and off-panel analytes is noted in the
device labeling, as summarized in Table 9.

Interference Testing
A study was conducted to evaluate the potential for assay interference due to the presence of
endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in upper respiratory specimens. In
addition, testing was also performed with representative on- and off-panel microorganisms at
very high concentrations to evaluate the potential for competitive interference between
analytes. Testing of each potentially interfering substance/microorganism was performed
using contrived positive and negative specimens. The positive specimens contained
representative on-panel analytes at concentrations equivalent to 3X their respective LoD
(Table 10). The concentration of each potentially interfering substance tested was chosen to
represent a high level that may be found in natural clinical specimens. The results of the
study are summarized in Tables 11-13.

Results from the representative assays for which Contrived Positive Samples were prepared are shown in red
Contrived Positive Samples contained the representative on-panel analytes at 3X LoD
Contrived Negative Samples contained only the potentially interfering substance
1 Initially, 1/3 samples was reported as negative; therefore, 2 additional replicates were tested, both of which
produced the expected results for all analytes
2 Initially, 1/3 samples was reported as invalid; the sample was retested and the results for all analytes were as
expected
None of the endogenous substances tested caused reproducible interference with the SPOTFIRE
R Panel.

Contrived Positive Samples contained the representative on-panel analytes at 3X LoD
Contrived Negative Samples contained only the potentially interfering species
1 Swab immersed in matrix for 15 min prior to testing
2 Initially, 1/3 samples was reported as invalid; therefore 2 additional replicates were tested and both produced the
expected results for all analytes
None of the exogenous substances associated with collection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens
tested were tested caused interference with the SPOTFIRE R Panel.

None of the disinfectants or decontamination products that were tested caused interference with
the SPOTFIRE R Panel. However, although bleach was not shown to have an adverse effect on
test performance under the conditions of this study, a warning to avoid contact of test samples
with bleach is included in the device labeling because of its known potential to cause nucleic
acid degradation.

medium under K103175, K110764 and K120267 for the BIOFIRE FilmArray
Respiratory Panel (RP). Bordetella parapertussis and SARS-CoV-2 were not included in
these studies but are biologically similar to other analytes on the panel (i.e., B. pertussis
and other seasonal coronaviruses). The original specimen stability studies with the
FilmArray RP are therefore applicable to support transport and storage claims for
nasopharyngeal swab specimens in viral transport medium for use with the SPOTFIRE R
Panel (i.e., 4 hours at 15-25 °C, 3 days at 2-8 °C or 30 days at < -15 °C).
0.9% Saline
A stability study was conducted with nasopharyngeal specimens in 0.9% saline under
DEN200031 for the BIOFIRE FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2.1. Included in the study
were all the analytes for this specimen type that are applicable to the SPOTFIRE R Panel.
The results of the study therefore support the stability of the SPOTFIRE R Panel analytes
in 0.9% saline (4 hours at 15-25 °C, 3 days at 2-8 °C or 30 days at < -15 °C).
6. Detection Limit:
Analytical Sensitivity
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for each analyte on the SPOTFIRE R Panel was determined
with samples prepared using artificial nasopharyngeal swab matrix in Viral Transport
Medium. A study showing that the formulation of the artificial matrix neither enhanced nor
impaired assay performance is described in Section VII B(2). The identity and concentration
of each viral or bacterial stock used in the study was either certified by the commercial
supplier or confirmed by quantitative real-time or digital PCR and standard methods. An
initial titration of each viral or bacterial stock was performed to estimate the LoD, which was
then confirmed by testing 20 replicates at the estimated LoD concentration and at one 10-fold
lower dilution. The LoD was considered confirmed if ≥ 19/20 replicates at the estimated LoD
concentration produced Positive results and ≤ 18/20 replicates at a 10-fold lower
concentration were reported as Negative.
For efficiency, the LoD study was conducted by co-spiking multiple analytes into each
sample. Therefore, additional testing was performed using a representative subset of target
analytes to determine whether testing of multiple species in the same reaction had any effect
test performance. Samples containing a single analyte were tested in replicates of 6 in
parallel with samples containing the same analyte in addition to other viruses/bacteria on the
SPOTFIRE R Panel. Overall, the results of the study showed that there was negligible
difference in the analytical sensitivity of the SPOTFIRE R Panel from the presence of
multiple target analytes in a sample (Tables 17 and 18).

Inclusivity (Analytical Reactivity)
The inclusivity of the SPOTFIRE R Panel was evaluated using a combination of in silico
analysis of publicly available sequence information and laboratory testing of contrived
specimens containing viral and bacterial isolates that were selected to represent phylogenetic,
geographic and temporal diversity.
In silico Analysis of Inclusivity
BLAST searches were conducted to obtain all available gene target sequences for each assay
with the SPOTFIRE R Panel. In silico analysis of the inclusivity of the panel was performed
using concatenated alignments of the nested primer sets for each target region. Mismatches to
the primers were evaluated for their potential to affect detection of the target analyte based
on their number and location within each primer sequence. In silico analysis of the
SPOTFIRE R Panel primers showed that the target sequences are generally well conserved
and that the assays are predicted to be robust to known mutations in these regions, with the
ability to detect all or nearly all isolates of the targeted analytes.

In silico analysis of the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 was performed using all available
sequences in the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data) database as of
December 21, 2022. Included in the analysis were 11,989,970 sequences of which ≥ 99.99%
were predicted to be detected by one or both SARS-CoV-2 assays within the SPOTFIRE R
Panel, including sequences of all lineages, Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest
identified to-date. Impaired sensitivity for detection by both SARS-CoV-2 assays was
predicted for < 0.004% of sequences evaluated (427/11,989,970).
Laboratory Testing of Inclusivity
Contrived samples containing individual viruses and bacteria were prepared at approximately 3X
LoD containing artificial matrix and tested in triplicate (unless noted in the tables below). All the
viral and bacterial isolates tested were successfully detected (Tables 19-32).

7. Assay Cut-Off:
DNA melt curve analysis is used to determine the presence or absence of the specific
amplification product(s) corresponding to each analyte within the SPOTFIRE R Panel. The
Melt Detector software analyzes each well of the second stage PCR array independently. A
series of mathematical tests is applied to each fluorescence curve to discriminate target-
specific amplicon from system noise and non-specific amplification products, taking into
account both system variation and known sequence variation within the amplified regions
targeted by the assay. The Melt Detector algorithm was developed by tuning against a large
data set comprised of both typical and atypical melt curves that were assigned as positive or
negative by manual review performed by expert users. The tuning process optimized the
sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm in comparison to manual result interpretation and
included optimization of the order of procedural steps and the respective threshold for each
parameter.
For each assay within the SPOTFIRE R Panel, the expected melting temperature (mean Tm)
was determined empirically using the most common sequence variants. The acceptable range
around the mean was then determined through a combination of empirical testing of known
sequence variants and mathematical modeling. Reference data obtained from analysis of
templates with known sequences were used to estimate additional sources of system
variability, including the SPOTFIRE instrument and reagents. The melt range parameters for
each analyte were validated in the subsequent Analytical and Clinical Studies.

8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Refer to Section VII (C) Clinical Studies.
9. Carry-Over:
The potential for sample-to-sample cross-contamination during operation of the SPOTFIRE
System was evaluated by testing an alternating series of positive and negative contrived
samples using the same Pouch Loading Station. The positive samples comprised high levels
of representative on-panel analytes in artificial matrix. Negative samples comprised artificial
matrix alone. No unexpected positive results were observed from a total of 15 negative
samples that were tested. These results demonstrated that there is an acceptable, low
likelihood of cross-contamination between samples when the SPOTFIRE R Panel is
performed according to the instructions for use.

2. Matrix Comparison:
Artificial vs Natural Matrix
The SPOTFIRE R Panel is intended to detect multiple viral and bacterial analytes in
nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The high frequency of positive samples for at least one
analyte makes it impractical to use natural clinical matrices for analytical validation studies
for which large volumes of negative matrix are required. To address this, artificial matrix was
used for most of the analytical testing and therefore an additional study was conducted to
demonstrate that the analytical sensitivity of the SPOTFIRE R Panel was similar with
samples prepared in artificial and natural specimen matrices, as described below.
Artificial nasopharyngeal swab (aNS) matrix comprised glycerol, porcine mucin, human
whole blood, phosphate buffered saline and saline diluted in transport medium (Viral
Transport Medium [VTM]). Testing was performed using a representative subset of analytes
targeted by the SPOTFIRE R Panel, including both DNA and RNA viruses. Ten-fold serial
dilutions of each analyte were prepared in artificial matrix and, in parallel, in natural clinical
matrix obtained from asymptomatic donors. Prior to conducting the study, the natural clinical

specimens were tested to verify that none of the on-panel analytes were present. A summary
of the results is presented in Table 34.
Positive results were obtained for all replicates with each analyte at target levels equal to or
above the claimed LoD except for Adenovirus in natural clinical matrix for which only 4/6
replicates (67%) were reported positive at the claimed LoD concentration. However,
amplification curve characteristics for Adenovirus were similar between positive replicates in
both the artificial and natural nasopharyngeal swab matrices at the LoD target level for this
analyte and all replicates in both matrices were positive at a 10-fold higher concentration,
suggesting that the analytical sensitivity of the assay with the two matrices is similar.
Overall, the results of the matrix equivalency study showed that the use of artificial matrix
does not enhance or impair device performance and is acceptable for analytical validation of
assay performance.

Fresh vs Frozen Samples
A study was performed with the BIOFIRE FilmArray Respiratory Panel under K160068 using
fresh and frozen nasopharyngeal swabs which showed that there were no adverse effects from
freezing and thawing of specimens. Because of the similarities between the BIOFIRE FilmArray
Respiratory Panel and the SPOTFIRE R Panel in terms of the targeted analytes, technology and
reagent formulations, these data are considered acceptable to support testing of archived, frozen
specimens in the Clinical Study to evaluate the performance of the SPOTFIRE R Panel.
Transport Media Equivalency
A study was conducted to evaluate the compatibility of the SPOTFIRE R Panel with alternative
transport media, including 0.9% normal saline, Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco), BD
Universal Viral Transport (UVT) medium (BD Medical), and Remel MicroTest M4RT (Thermo
Fisher). Testing was performed using contrived samples in artificial nasopharyngeal swab matrix
containing representative analytes (including bacteria and DNA and RNA viruses) at
concentrations spanning the claimed analytical LoD (5X, 1X and 0.2X LoD). For the purposes of
the study, the test analytes were prepared in the form of two panels, each of 5 on-panel species.
The results obtained with each of the alternative transport media were compared to those
obtained using Viral Transport Medium (VTM) as a control and are summarized in Table 35.
The results of the study met the acceptance criteria in all cases thereby demonstrating the
compatibility of the SPOTFIRE R Panel with 0.9% Saline, Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, BD
UVT medium and M4RT transport medium.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the SPOTFIRE R Panel was evaluated using a combination of
prospectively collected and archived specimens as described below.
Prospectively Collected Specimens
A Clinical Study with prospectively collected specimens was conducted at five sites (4 U.S.
and 1 ex-U.S.), including adult and pediatric emergency departments/urgent care centers, that
were considered representative of the intended use settings for the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE
System and SPOTFIRE R Panel. The specimens included in the study were either collected
under Informed Consent (if required by the participating institution), and with parental
permission for minors < 18 years of age or were leftover (residual) samples from standard of
care testing. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study, which spanned the period
between December 2020 to June 2021, are summarized in Table 36. Aliquots of each
specimen were prepared for testing with the SPOTFIRE R Panel and the applicable
comparator method(s). All aliquots of nasopharyngeal swab specimens for comparator
testing were stored at -70 °C. At each of the study sites, specimen enrollment began prior to
the availability of BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE instruments. During this period, the specimen
aliquots for testing with the SPOTFIRE R Panel were frozen at -70 °C (refer to Matrix
Comparison in Section VII (B)(2)).

A total of 1215 nasopharyngeal were initially enrolled in the Prospective Clinical Study, of
which 95 were excluded from the analysis of performance for the reasons listed in Table 38.
In addition, some specimens were excluded from the analysis of performance for one or more
specific analytes due to improper storage of sample aliquots or to failure or inappropriate
conduct of the comparator method and inability to perform retesting due volume constraints.
All nasopharyngeal swabs included in the analysis of performance were collected in viral

Archived Specimens
Several analytes included on the SPOTFIRE R Panel were not encountered during the
Prospective Clinical Study in sufficient numbers to demonstrate system performance.
Therefore, the Prospective Clinical Study was supported by additional testing that was
performed at the four U.S. study sites on frozen, archived specimens obtained from various
clinical laboratories from around the world. These specimens were selected for inclusion in
the study based on their microbial content as originally determined by the source laboratory
and were stored frozen prior to testing. The microbial content of the archived specimens was
confirmed using the same molecular comparator methods as for the prospectively collected
specimens (Table 37). A mimimum sample volume of 650 µL was required for confirmatory
testing.
A total of 562 archived nasopharyngeal swabs was obtained, of which 20 were excluded
from the analysis of performance due to invalid SPOTFIRE R Panel results or to invalid or
missing comparator test results (Table 40).

Clinical Performance
A summary of the results from testing prospectively collected and archived nasopharyngeal
swabs is shown in Table 42. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) ranged from 96.3-100% for
prospectively collected specimens and from 96.0-100% for archived specimens, depending
on the analyte, whereas Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) ranged from 90.6-100% for
prospectively collected specimens and from 96.7-100% for archived specimens. The only
analyte for which NPA was < 95% was Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus with prospectively
collected specimens. However, additional testing provided evidence for the presence of
Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus in 54/72 prospectively collected specimens (75.0%) with
discordant positive SPOTFIRE R Panel results and therefore the low NPA with this analyte
in the prospective study was considered acceptable.
Overall, the SPOTFIRE R Panel exhibited acceptable PPA and NPA in comparison to other
FDA-cleared methods for the detection of the targeted analytes in nasopharyngeal swab
specimens.

FDA-cleared assay (44) or with PCR followed by bidirectional sequencing (8), or both (1)
Table 43 shows further stratification of the results from testing prospectively collected
nasopharyngeal specimens according to the temperature of storage prior to analysis. Most
specimens were held at either 4 °C (n = 844; 75.3%) or room temperature (n = 17; 1.5%)
while the remainder (n = 259; 23.1%) were frozen (≤ -70 °C). There were no notable
differences in performance based on the temperature of specimen storage.

1 54/72 specimens with “false positive” results for Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (75.0%) were reported positive
for these analytes upon retesting with the same FDA-cleared comparator (1), by testing with either an alternative
FDA-cleared assay (44) or with PCR followed by bidirectional sequencing (8), or both (1)
Coinfections
The SPOTFIRE R Panel reported infections due to a single analyte from 51.0% of
nasopharyngeal swab specimens (551/1120) in the Prospective Clinical Study, and coinfection
with two or more analytes from 9.5% of specimens (106/1120) (Table 44). Among the
coinfected specimens, 90 (84.9%) were positive for two analytes and 16 (15.1%) were positive
for three or more using the SPOTFIRE R Panel.
