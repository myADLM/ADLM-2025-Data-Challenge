III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA)
used for the qualitative detection of specific IgG antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-
1) in human serum (collected in serum and serum separator tubes) and plasma (collected in
dipotassium EDTA, lithium heparin, and lithium heparin plasma separator tubes) on the
ARCHITECT i System.
The ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay is to be used for testing sexually active adults or expectant
mothers to aid in the presumptive diagnosis of HSV-1 infection. The test results may not
determine the state of active lesions or associated disease manifestations, particularly for primary
infection. The predictive value of a reactive or nonreactive result depends on the prevalence of
HSV-1 infection in the population and the pre-test likelihood of HSV-1 infection.
NOTE: The performance of the ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay has not been established for use
in the pediatric population, for neonatal screening, or for testing immunocompromised or
immunosuppressed patients. The assay has not been FDA cleared or approved for screening
blood or plasma donors.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use with the ARCHITECT i2000SR System.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay is an automated, two-step immunoassay for the qualitative
detection of IgG antibodies to HSV-1 in human serum and plasma using chemiluminescent
microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology.
The kit contains different components: Reagent (microparticles, conjugate and assay diluent),
Calibrator, and external Controls (reactive and nonreactive).
Interpretation of results
The cutoff is 1.00 S/CO.
The ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG test result should be used in conjunction with information
available from clinical evaluation and other diagnostic procedures.
K213987 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
S/CO Interpretation
< 1.00 Nonreactive
≥ 1.00 Reactive
B Principle of Operation:
The specimen is incubated with assay diluent and the microparticles which contain specific
recombinant-gG1 antigen. Antigen-antibody complexes will form if anti-HSV-1 antibody is
present in the specimen. The mixture is washed and the unbound material is removed. The
conjugate contains monoclonal anti-human IgG labeled with acridinium, and is used to detect
HSV-1 IgG in the patient specimen. Anti-human IgG acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to
create a reaction mixture and incubated. Following a wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger
Solutions are added.
The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit (RLU). There is a
relationship between the amount of HSV-1 IgG detected in the sample and the RLU measured by
the system optics.
The presence or absence of HSV-1 IgG in the sample is determined by comparing the
chemiluminescent RLU measured to the cutoff RLU determined from an active calibration.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A multi-center clinical study was conducted to evaluate the clinical performance of the
ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent
Agreement (NPA) were determined by comparing the performance of the ARCHITECT
HSV-1 IgG assay to a composite comparator method comprised of a commercially available
anti-HSV-1 IgG immunoblot method (comparator assay) and a Western Blot reference
confirmatory test (University of Washington, Seattle).
A total of 915 specimens, which included sexually active individuals and pregnant females,
were collected prospectively within the United States and tested at 3 independent external
laboratories. The PPA and NPA results are summarized in the following tables.

2. Tube Types Matrix Comparison:
Sixty-two (62) sets of matched reactive and nonreactive samples of different matrices
(serum, serum separator tube (SST), dipotassium EDTA plasma, lithium-heparin plasma and
lithium heparin plasma separator tube (PST)) from commercial sources were evaluated with
the ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay on the ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument for
equivalency. The samples were analyzed by linear regression.
The following tube types are acceptable for use with the ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay:
• Serum
• Serum separator
• Plasma (dipotassium EDTA, lithium heparin, lithium heparin separator).
C Clinical Agreement Study:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
2. Clinical Specificity:
Not applicable
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
CDC Panel Agreement.
The CDC panel consisted of 2 aliquots each of 50 serum samples with unknown HSV-1
status for a total of 100 blind characterized samples.
The ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay demonstrated 100% Positive Percent Agreement (PPA)
for reactive samples (46/46) and 100% Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) for nonreactive
samples (54/54) in concordance with the results provided by the CDC.

See Assay Cut-Off
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Representative performance data are provided in this section. Results obtained in individual
laboratories may vary considering HSV prevalence. The prevalence may vary depending upon
geographical location, age, sex, type of test employed, specimen collection and handling
procedures as well as clinical history of the patient.
It is recommended that each laboratory determine its own reference range based upon its
particular local and population characteristics.
Clinical performance of the ARCHITECT HSV-1 IgG assay was evaluated with 915 samples
collected prospectively from individuals from the intended use population. Of the 915

individuals, there were 670 (73%) females and 245 (27%) males. The median age was 35 years
(age range: 14 to 99 years). Testing of the specimens was performed at 3 clinical testing sites.
