See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor IX is for clinical laboratory use in the quantitative
determination of factor IX activity in 3.2% citrated human plasma. It is intended to be used in
identifying factor IX deficiency and as an aid in the management of hemophilia B in individuals
aged 2 years and older. For in vitro diagnostic use.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Instrument Laboratory (IL) ACL TOP (K160276) and ACL TOP Family 50 Series (K150877)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor IX is used for determination of FIX activity and contains the
following four components, packaged in vials, and provided frozen to preserve the integrity of
the components:
Reagent Name Format (per vial set; each box Description
contains 4 vial sets
Reagent 1 1 x 0.75 mL Frozen Human FVIII, human FX, bovine FV
and a fibrin polymerization inhibitor
Reagent 2 1 x 2.3 mL Frozen Human FXIa, human FII, calcium
chloride and phospholipids
Reagent 3 1 x 1.0 mL Frozen FXa Substrate containing EDTA and
thrombin inhibitor
Diluent Buffer 1x 10.0 mL Frozen Tris buffer solution containing 1% BSA
and a heparin antagonist
B Principle of Operation:
CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor IX is a chromogenic factor IX assay. In this assay, FIX
activity is determined in a chromogenic method, in which human FIX is activated by human
FXIa and where formed FIXa activates human FX in the presence of human FVIII, calcium ions
and phospholipid. Similar to in vivo conditions, FVIII is activated by thrombin which is
generated during the incubation. The amount of FXa formed is related to the FIX activity and is
determined from the hydrolysis of a chromogenic FXa substrate. The color produced by the
release of p-Nitroanilide (pNA) is measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm and is
proportional to the factor IX in the sample. FIX results are reported in percent activity where
100% FIX activity is equivalent to 1.0 IU/mL.

2. Linearity:
The linearity studies were performed following the CLSI EP06 2nd Ed guideline using three
reagent lots at one site on a single IL ACL TOP 700 CTS instrument. Fourteen sample dilutions
were prepared using a high FIX plasma (~230%) with congenital FIX deficient plasma (~0%) to
create sample dilutions ranging from 0–230% FIX activity. Each dilution was tested in four
replicates. The linear range for CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor FIX assay was determined to
be 0–200%.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference study was conducted in accordance with the CLSI EP07-A3 guideline. A single lot
of CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor IX was used on an IL ACL TOP 700 CTS instrument.

Potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances were spiked into the control
samples (one normal and one abnormal reference control plasma). Ten replicates were evaluated
for each spiked plasma or matrix-blank plasma. The maximum concentration of each interferent
was determined per CLSI EP37 guideline. None of the substances in the following table
(endogenous or exogenous) were found to lead to clinically significant interference (up to the
concentrations indicated in the table below).
Interferent Concentration
Unconjugated Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Conjugated Bilirubin 23 mg/dL

4. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
Three levels of CRYOcheck Reference controls are prepared from human citrated plasma
with three different concentrations of hemostatic parameters. CRYOcheck Reference Control
Normal (K013708) was normal human citrated plasma while CRYOcheck Abnormal 1
Reference Control (K952624) and CRYOcheck Abnormal 2 Reference Control (K952624)
were the citrated human plasma with hemostatic parameter values in the borderline
pathological range 30% to 44% and 9% to 17%, respectively. Calibrator value assignments
are traceable to the WHO International Standard for Factor IX (4th IS Factors II, VII, IX, X,
Plasma, 09/172).
Sample Stability
Sample stability studies were performed to support the recommended storage and handling
instructions found in the device labeling. Citrated plasma samples were tested after storage in
the following temperature ranges, room temperature (18–22°C) and below -70°C. The study
was performed using two reagent lots of CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor IX on IL ACL
TOP 300 and IL ACL TOP 700 analyzers with five replicate measurements at each time
point for each sample. The study data demonstrate that citrated plasma samples are stable for
four hours when stored at room temperature (18–22°C), three months when stored at <-70°C,
including up to two freeze thaw cycles.
Shelf-life Stability
The shelf-life stability study was performed to determine the shelf-life stability of
CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor IX when stored at ≤-70 °C. The study was conducted with
five plasma samples (one normal, two abnormal reference controls and two patient plasmas)

using three lots of CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor IX on an IL ACL TOP 700 CTS
analyzer. Samples were thawed from ≤-70 °C storage and tested in five replicates for FIX
activity at the following timepoints: 0, 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19, 24, 25, 36 and 37 months. The
study is ongoing and current data supports the shelf-life stability claim of 18 months when
the product is stored at ≤-70 °C.
In Use Stability
The in-use stability studies were performed to characterize in-use stability of CRYOcheck
Chromogenic Factor IX assay when maintained at three different in-use conditions: on-board
ACL TOP analyzer (12–18°C), in a refrigerator (2–8°C) and refrozen at ≤-70°C after
maintaining on board for 3 hours. Five plasma samples (one normal, two abnormal reference
controls and two patient plasmas) were tested by one operator on one IL ACL TOP 700 CTS
analyzer. Samples were tested in five replicates by using three lots of CRYOcheck
Chromogenic Factor IX at each storage condition at each timepoint. The study data supports
the in-use stability claim of 24-hours when the product is stored on-board (12–18°C), 48
hours at 2–8°C and 1 month stored at ≤-70°C if the product is stored on board and refrozen
within 4 hours of the initial thaw. The refrozen product must be used within 8 hours of next
thawing while kept on-board.
5. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantification (LoQ) for test
system were determined following the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Each study design included
three reagent lots and one representative instrument model (IL ACL TOP 700 CTS).
The LoB was determined using four blank plasma samples obtained from individuals with
severe congenital hemophilia B. Each sample was tested in triplicate using three lots of
CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor IX over five days on an IL ACL TOP instrument for N=15
determinations per reagent lot. The LoB was determined to be 0.4% FIX activity.
The LoD was determined using four plasma samples with low FIX activity obtained from
individuals with congenital hemophilia B donors. Each sample was tested in triplicate using
three lots of CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor IX over five days on an IL ACL TOP
instrument for N=15 determinations per reagent lot. The LoD was determined to be 0.5%
FIX activity.
The LoQ was determined using four plasma samples with low FIX activity obtained from
congenital hemophilia B donors. Samples were measured in triplicate using three lots of
CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor IX over five days on an IL ACL TOP 700 instrument. The
samples were also measured in triplicate using a validated laboratory-developed chromogenic
factor IX assay (ROX Factor IX) over five days to determine the assigned values. The LoQ
was determined to be 0.5% FIX activity.

7. Recovery of FIX Replacement Therapies
K214002 - Page 8 of 10

--- Page 9 ---
The recovery of replacement therapy study was conducted to evaluate the recovery of FIX
activity of seven FIX replacement therapies with one lot of CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor
IX. A congenital FIX deficiency plasma was used to prepare seven concentration levels for
each FIX replacement therapy (1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 IU/mL). Ten replicates of
each level of each product were tested on an IL ACL TOP 700 CTS analyzer. The FIX
percent recovery was determined from the measured versus expected FIX activity (%) of
each product at each level. CRYOcheck Chromogenic Factor IX recovered FIX activity
levels in plasma containing AlphaNine, Alprolix, BeneFIX, Ixinity, Rebinyn and Rixubiz at
concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1.0 IU/mL. There was an over estimation of Idelvion
across all concentration relative to labeled potency.

The method comparison study was conducted using the CRYOcheck Chromogenic FIX on
the Instrumentation Laboratory (IL) ACL TOP 700 and IL ACL TOP 750 CTS by testing
n=386 clinical samples (citrated plasma) collected from the intended use population. Results
