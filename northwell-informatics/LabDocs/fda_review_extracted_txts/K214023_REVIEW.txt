C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Due to the occurrence of minor errors (resulting in a category agreement below 90% for the
following species), perform an alternative method of testing prior to reporting of results for the
following antibiotic/organism combination:
Ciprofloxacin (cip02): MICs of 0.25μg/mL or 0.5 μg/mL for P. rettgeri
Due to the occurrence of minor errors (resulting in a categorical agreement below 90% for the
manual dilution option), perform an alternative method of testing prior to reporting of results
generated with the manual dilution option for the following antibiotic/organism combinations:
Ciprofloxacin (cip02): MIC of 0.5 μg/mL for S. marcescens, K. pneumoniae
The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s) is unknown
because resitant strains were not available at the time of comparative testing:
Ciprofloxacin: Salmonella enteridis, Salmonella typhi and Shigella sonnei
D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using VITEK 2 Systems 8.01 software (or later)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Ciprofloxacin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.06,
0.12, 0.5 and 1 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The
ciprofloxacin MIC result range for the VITEK 2 is ≤0.06 to ≥4 μg/mL. For all species, the
VITEK 2 system is capable of reporting the following MIC results: ≤0.06, 0.12, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2,
and ≥4 μg/mL for the AST-Gram Negative Ciprofloxacin test.
K214023 - Page 3 of 14

--- Page 4 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the VITEK 2 AST-GN Ciprofloxacin was previously evaluated during
review of K162737 and was determined to be acceptable.
In summary, a 10-isolate panel composed of species consistent with the intended use were
tested at three sites using both inoculation methods (manual and automatic) for testing with
the VITEK 2 and the manual inoculation method for testing with the VITEK 2 Compact.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Not applicable
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Quality Control (QC) testing, Inoculum and Growth failure for the VITEK 2 GN-AST
Ciprofloxacin were previously evaluated during review of K162737 and were determined to
be acceptable. QC specific to the change in breakpoints was not performed since the QC
ranges used in K162737 were either unchanged (E. coli ATCC 25922) or expanded (P.
aeruginosa ATCC 27853; range expanded from 0.25 – 1 μg/mL to 0.12 – 1 μg/mL) and
therefore would not negatively impact QC performance. QC results with unchanged and
expanded QC ranges are shown in Table 1.
In summary, QC organisms recommended by both the FDA and CLSI, namely E. coli ATCC
25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, were tested using the reference broth microdilution
(BMD) method and the VITEK 2 GN-AST Ciprofloxacin during the clinical study. The
overall QC results for both the reference and VITEK 2 were acceptable. Both the BMD
dilution range (≤0.008 - ≥8 μg/mL) and the VITEK 2 Ciprofloxacin card (≤0.06 - ≥4 μg/mL)
covered the full expected result range of P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (expected range of
K214023 - Page 6 of 14

--- Page 7 ---
0.12-1 µg/mL); however, resulted in off-scale MIC values for E. coli ATCC 25922 (expected
range of 0.004-0.016 µg/mL). An E. coli ATCC 25922 MIC value of ≤0.008 µg/mL (with
BMD) and ≤0.06 µg/mL (with VITEK 2) indicated that the quality control test results were
acceptable. To address the expected off-scale QC results when testing E. coli ATCC 25922,
the device labeling reviewed in the current submission includes the following footnote under
the Quality Control Table:
“Does not include the full CLSI/FDA recommended dilution range for QC testing with this
organism”.

1VITEK 2 Card range for Ciprofloxacin is ≤0.06 - ≥4 μg/mL and does not include the full CLSI/FDA-recommended
dilution range for QC testing of E. coli ATCC 25922. The lowest concentration of the VITEK 2 Ciprofloxacin MIC
range is 0.06 µg/mL. Obtaining a value of ≤0.06 µg/mL was considered an indication that the quality control test
results were acceptable. Similarly, the lowest concentration of the BMD Ciprofloxacin MIC range is 0.008 µg/mL.
Obtaining a value of ≤0.008 µg/mL was considered an indication that the quality control test results were acceptable.
2BMD: CLSI reference broth microdilution.
Since the full QC range was covered for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, the QC performance
data is acceptable for the purpose of re-evaluating Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa
performance when the updated breakpoints are applied.

Performance after reanalysis and additional testing
The VITEK 2 AST-GN Ciprofloxacin (≤0.06 - ≥4 µg/mL) was originally cleared in
premarket submission K162737. Since there were no changes to the design or dilution range
of the VITEK 2 AST card, performance evaluation was achieved via reanalysis of the MIC
data provided in the original 510(k) submission (K162737) using revised interpretive criteria
currently recognized by FDA for ciprofloxacin against Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa.
An additional 88 isolates were added to the original 890 Enterobacteriaceae
(Enterobacterales) data set for evaluation of the VITEK 2/automatic dilution method to
address a lack of resistant isolates and potential categorical errors as a consequence of the
revised interpretive criteria (43 Serratia marcescens, 6 Enterobacter cloacae, 2 Enterobacter
cloacae cloacae, 22 Enterobacter cloacae complex, and 15 Providencia rettgeri isolates). In
addition, one Klebsiella pneumonia pneumoniae isolate was removed from the reanalysis due
to a prior misidentification; this isolate has now been identified as Acinetobacter baumannii
complex, a species for which FDA does not have recognized breakpoints, resulting in a total
of 977 (908 clinical and 69 challenge) Enterobacterales isolates for analysis using revised
interpretive criteria for Enterobacterales. No additional testing was performed for P.
aeruginosa and the original 236 (146 clinical and 90 challenge) isolate data set was
reanalyzed using the revised interpretive criteria for P. aeruginosa.
The VITEK 2 with automatic dilution method results are shown in Table 2 for the reanalysis
of data based on the updated interpretive criteria for Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa. For
Enterobacterales, this included the original clinical and challenge data combined with the
data after additional testing. For P. aeruginosa, this was based only on the original clinical
and challenge data combined since no additional testing was performed.
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems with manual dilution method results of the
reanalyzed challenge data with updated Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa interpretive
criteria are summarized in Table 3. Original data obtained with Salmonella spp. was not
reanalyzed since the interpretive criteria remain unchanged since the original submission.

EA – Essential Agreement min – minor errors
CA – Category Agreement maj – major errors
EVAL – Evaluable isolates vmj – very major errors
R – Resistant isolates
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the MIC result of the reference method and that of the
VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on
scale for both the VITEK 2 test card and the reference method or those in which an off scale result is at least two doubling
dilutions from the on scale result. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference
method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK 2 test card.
The combined Essential Agreement (EA) for Enterobacterales is >90% which is acceptable,
as described in the “Class II Special Control Guidance Document: Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA, August 2009” (AST
guidance).
The updated breakpoints for Enterobacterales lowered the susceptible, intermediate and
resistant breakpoints by two two-fold dilutions. Applying the updated breakpoints for
Enterobacterales reduced the combined Category Agreement (CA) from 97.8% in K162737
to 95.2% in the current submission, due to an increase in minor errors from 18 (2.0%) to 45
(4.6%) and very major errors from 0 (0%) to 1 (0.4%). These results are acceptable.
The combined EA for P. aeruginosa is >90% which is acceptable, as described in the AST
guidance. The updated breakpoints for P. aeruginosa lowered the susceptible, intermediate
and resistant breakpoints by one two-fold dilution. Applying the updated breakpoints for P.
aeruginosa increased the combined CA from 94.1% in K162737 to 96.6% in the current
submission, due to a decrease in minor errors from 12 (5.1%) to 8 (3.4%), major errors from
1 (0.7%) to 0 (0%), and very major errors from 1 (1.1%) to 0 (0%).

EVAL – Evaluable isolates vmj – very major errors
R – Resistant isolates
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the MIC result of the reference method and that of the
VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on
scale for both the VITEK 2 test card and the reference method or those in which an off scale result is at least two doubling
dilutions from the on scale result. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference
method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK 2 test card.
The EA of Enterobacterales challenge isolates is >90% with the manual dilution option of
the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact instruments, which is acceptable. However, applying
the updated breakpoints for Enterobacterales resulted in low CA for both VITEK 2 and
VITEK 2 Compact, which was caused by the large number of minor errors. Since the EA of
evaluable results is >90% and the majority of the categorical errors were minor errors, the
following limitations are added to the package insert to address the low CA with the manual
dilution option and the number of minor errors generated with the automatic and manual
dilution options:
Due to the occurrence of minor errors (resulting in a category agreement below 90% for
the following species), perform an alternative method of testing prior to reporting of
results for the following antibiotic/organism combination:
Ciprofloxacin (cip02): MICs of 0.25μg/mL or 0.5 μg/mL for P. rettgeri
Due to the occurrence of minor errors (resulting in a categorical agreement below 90%
for the manual dilution option), perform an alternative method of testing prior to
reporting of results generated with the manual dilution option for the following
antibiotic/organism combinations:
Ciprofloxacin (cip02): MIC of 0.5 μg/mL for S. marcescens, K. pneumoniae

The EA of P. aeruginosa challenge isolates is >90% with the manual dilution option of the
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact instruments, which is acceptable. Applying the updated
breakpoints for P. aeruginosa resulted in >90% CA, three minor errors (3.3%), and zero
major or very major errors, which is acceptable.
As required under 511A(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the
following statement is included in the device labeling to address testing of non-indicated
species:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.
Resistant Organisms
A total of 129 (14.5%) Enterobacteriaceae, 3 (14.2%) Salmonella spp., and 90 (38.1%) P.
aeruginosa isolates) were originally found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin by the reference
method (K162737). After applying the updated breakpoints for Enterobacterales and P.
aeruginosa and including data from the additional testing with Enterobacterales, a total of
241 (24.7%) Enterobacterales isolates and 99 (41.9%) of P. aeruginosa isolates were
determined to be resistant to ciprofloxacin by the reference method. As an impact from the
change in breakpoints and the testing of additional challenge Enterobacterales isolates the
resistance rates have slightly increased compared to the original clearance providing more
datapoints for assessing CA and error rates. Based on the time of initial testing, the resistant
strains evaluated in the original study likely represent the current resistance population.
Additional testing with 28 Enterobacter cloacae spp. and 20 Providencia rettgeri resistant
isolates resulted in the removal of these species from the original limitation statement
regarding a lack of testing with resistant organisms. As such, the limitation statement has
been updated as follows:
The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s) is
unknown because resistant strains were not available at the time of comparative testing:
Ciprofloxacin: Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhi and Shigella sonnei
MIC Trending Analysis
A trending reanalysis was performed using the combined (clinical and challenge)
Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa data obtained in K162737 to align with current trending
analysis methods utilized and to also assess the data from additional testing with
Enterobacterales isolates with the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method.
This trending calculation takes into account MIC values that are determined to be one or
more doubling dilutions lower or higher than the reference method irrespective of whether
the device MIC values are on-scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution
K214023 - Page 11 of 14

--- Page 12 ---
lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are
not considered in the trending analysis.
Organisms in which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs. lower
MIC values was ≥ 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined to be
statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that showed
higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in the labeling.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling was updated as follows:
• Inclusion of a statement to address testing of non-indicated species, as required by the 21st
Century Cures Act legislation
• Updated breakpoints for Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with Ciprofloxacin
• Updated performance data using the currently recognized breakpoints, along with limitation
statements to reflect results obtained from this evaluation
• Inclusion of a footnote to the performance table to reflect results obtained from a trending
analysis
• Update of the previous limitation statement regarding lack of testing with resistant organisms
to only include Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhi and Shigella sonnei
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.

IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 System with Ciprofloxacin when revised breakpoints for
Ciprofloxacin are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol
included with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, BioMérieux will update
the Ciprofloxacin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance
section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and
(3)any new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
