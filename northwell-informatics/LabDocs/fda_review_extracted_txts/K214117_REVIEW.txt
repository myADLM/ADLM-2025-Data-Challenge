III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Afinion™ HbA1c
Afinion™ HbA1c is an in-vitro diagnostic test for quantitative determination of glycated
hemoglobin (%hemoglobin A1c, % HbA1c) venous and capillary human whole blood. The
measurement of % HbA1c is recommended as a marker of long term metabolic control in
persons with diabetes mellitus.
Afinion™ 2
Afinion™ 2 analyzer is a compact multi-assay analyzer for point-of-care testing, designed to
analyze the Afinion™ test cartridges. Afinion™ 2 system, consisting of Afinion™ 2 analyzer
and Afinion™ test cartridges is for in vitro diagnostic use only.
Alere Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer
Alere Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer with Alere Afinion™ Data Connectivity Converter (ADCC) is
a compact multi-assay analyzer for point-of-care testing, designed to analyze the Afinion™ Test
Cartridges. The ADCC is a small device for automatic transfer of data, including patient and
control assay results, from the Alere Afinion™ Analyzer to a laboratory information system or
another electronic journal system.
Alere Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer System, consisting of Alere Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer with
Alere Afinion™ Data Connectivity Converter (ADCC), Afinion™ Test Cartridges and
Afinion™ Controls is for in vitro diagnostic use only.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Afinion HbA1c is a fully automated boronate affinity assay for the determination of the
percentage of hemoglobin A1c in human venous and capillary whole blood. Each assay cartridge
contains blue boronic acid conjugate, a tube with a polyethersulfone membrane, and washing
solution (morpholine buffered sodium chloride solution with detergents and preservative). Each
cartridge is labeled with a unique barcode.
The Afinion HbA1c is factory calibrated and intended for use with the previously cleared
Afinion AS100 Analyzer (K050574, K110056, K151809), the Afinion 2 (K171650) and the
Afinion HbA1c Controls (K050574).
B Principle of Operation:
Afinion™ HbA1c is a fully automated boronate affinity assay. The test Cartridge contains all of
the necessary reagents. The sample is collected with the integrated sampling device and the Test
Cartridge is placed in the cartridge chamber of the analyzer. The blood sample is then
automatically diluted and mixed with a solution that releases hemoglobin from the erythrocytes.
The hemoglobin precipitates. This sample mixture is transferred to a blue boronic acid conjugate,
which binds to the cis-diols of glycated hemoglobin. This reaction mixture is soaked through a
filter membrane and all precipitated hemoglobin, conjugate bound and unbound (i.e., glycated
and non-glycated hemoglobin) remains on the membrane. Any excess of conjugate is removed
with washing reagent.
The analyzer evaluates the precipitate on the membrane. By measuring the reflectance, the blue
(glycated hemoglobin) and the red (total hemoglobin) color intensities are evaluated. The ratio
between them is proportionate to the percentage of HbA1c in the sample. The % HbA1c is
displayed on the Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer and the Afinion™ 2.

Cross reactivity with Hemoglobin Derivatives
Potential cross reactivity with acetylated hemoglobin, carbamylated hemoglobin, labile
HbA1c, and glycated albumin was evaluated and found to support the sponsor’s claims,
included in the candidate labeling, that there is no cross reactivity with acetylated
hemoglobin (4.6 mg/mL), carbamylated hemoglobin (13.8 mg/mL), labile HbA1c (11.4
mg/mL), or glycated albumin (7.7 mg/mL).
Hemoglobin Variant Interference
Hemoglobin variant testing demonstrated no significant interference for Hemoglobin A2 (≤
5.7%), Hemoglobin S (≤ 42%), Hemoglobin C (≤ 36%), Hemoglobin E (≤ 26%),
Hemoglobin D (≤ 42%) and Hemoglobin F (≤10.4%). The sponsor’s definition of non-
significant interference is ≤7% mean relative deviation between the candidate method and the
comparator method.
The labeling of the candidate HbA1c assay was updated to reflect these results as well as the
following: “The highest HbF concentration where no significant interference (= 7%) is
observed is 10.4% HbF. Above 10.4% HbF, a negative interference is observed”.
4. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The Afinion HbA1c assay is traceable to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry
and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Reference Method for Measurement of HbA1c. The
Afinion HbA1c assay is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization
Program (NGSP).

Recommendations from American Diabetes Association (ADA):
A reasonable goal for many nonpregnant adults with diabetes is HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol).
More or less stringent glycemic goals may be appropriate for individual patients. Goals should
be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions,
known CVD or advanced microvascular complications, hypoglycemia unawareness, and
individual patient considerations.
