C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Both assays are performed on the BD MAX System.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BD MAX System with the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel (EBP) and BD MAX Extended
Enteric Bacterial Panel (xEBP) are gastrointestinal bacterial panel multiplex nucleic acid-based
assay system comprised of an instrument with associated hardware and accessories, disposable
microfluidic cartridges, real-time PCR master mixes, unitized reagent strips, extraction reagents,
and sample buffer tubes (SBT). The instrument automates sample preparation including target
lysis, DNA extraction and concentration, reagent rehydration, and target nucleic acid
amplification and detection using real-time PCR. The assays include a Sample Processing
Control (SPC) that is present in the Extraction Tube. The SPC monitors DNA extraction steps,
thermal cycling steps, reagent integrity and the presence of inhibitory substances. The BD MAX
System software automatically interprets test results. The BD MAX EBP and xEBP are FDA-
cleared under K140111 and K170308, respectively.
The BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP instructions for use include testing of unpreserved stool
specimens collected and transported to the laboratory in a dry, clean container, Cary-Blair
preserved stool specimens collected using a plastic paddle (scoop) to place a stool sample into 15
mL of Cary-Blair media for transport, or stool specimens collected and transported using the
Copan FecalSwab Collection, Transport, and Preservation System (Copan FecalSwab). Stool
specimens from rectal swabs or fixed stools have not been validated with the BD MAX EBP or
xEBP.
The Copan FecalSwab is comprised of a nylon flocked specimen collection swab co-packaged
with a tube filled pre-filled with 2 mL of a modified Cary-Blair preservative. The Copan
FecalSwab is also co-branded as the BD FecalSwab Collection, Transport and Preservation
System (BD FecalSwab); the terms Copan FecalSwab, BD FecalSwab, and FecalSwab are used
interchangeably below.
K214122 - Page 4 of 23

--- Page 5 ---
B Principle of Operation:
A stool specimen is collected and transported to the laboratory in a dry, clean container (for
unpreserved specimens), in Cary-Blair transport media, or using the Copan FecalSwab
Collection, Transport, and Preservation System. Unpreserved stool samples and Cary-Blair
preserved stool samples are placed in a BD MAX SBT using a 10 μL transfer loop for analysis
on the BD Max System.
To use the Copan FecalSwab stool specimens, the operator transfers fecal material from an
unpreserved stool specimen to the vial of FecalSwab transport medium using the nylon flocked
specimen collection swab. The operator unscrews the cap of the FecalSwab transport medium
tube and transfers the swab with sample into the tube. The operator breaks the swab shaft at the
break point line molded into the shaft, discards the handle part of the swab shaft, and screws the
cap onto the FecalSwab tube to close. Before analysis on the BD MAX system, FecalSwab stool
samples are vortexed and then 50 μL of sample is pipetted into a BD MAX SBT.
The SBT is closed with a septum cap and vortexed. A worklist is created and the SBT, unitized
reagent strips, master mix, extraction tubes, and PCR cartridges are loaded onto the BD MAX
System. The BD MAX System automates sample preparation including cell lysis, DNA
extraction and concentration, reagent rehydration, and target nucleic acid amplification and
detection using real-time PCR. Amplified targets are detected with hydrolysis probes labeled
with quenched fluorophores. The amplification, detection and interpretation of the signals are
done automatically by the BD MAX System.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
BD MAX System
2. Specimen Identification:
The BD MAX System fully automates cell lysis, nucleic acid extraction, PCR set-up, target
amplification and detection. The system can process and analyze up to 24 specimens in one
cartridge with two cartridges running simultaneously on the instrument. The system includes
external and internal barcode reading, ensuring traceability throughout extraction and PCR
process. The system includes a heater module, temperature sensors, and a fluorescence
detection system with six optical channels. Detection of the target analyte from real-time
PCR is by flurogenic target-specific hybridization (TaqMan Probes).
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A trained operator uses a disposable inoculating loop to place 10 μL of unpreserved or Cary-
Blair stool specimen into a SBT which is then vortexed and placed onto the system.
Alternatively, a trained operator can manually pipette 50 μL of preserved stool specimen
from the FecalSwab collection tube into a SBT which is then vortexed and placed onto the
system.
4. Calibration:
The system is calibrated by the manufacturer on-site as part of the installation procedure as
well as during biannual preventive maintenance.
K214122 - Page 5 of 23

--- Page 6 ---
5. Quality Control:
External controls are not provided with the BD MAX EBP or xEBP; however
recommendations for control preparation and testing are provide in the package inserts.
Both panels include an individual Sample Processing Control (SPC) as part of every test that
undergoes the extraction, concentration and amplification steps to monitor for potential
inhibitory substances which may be present. Additionally, the SPC monitors for potential
process inefficiency due to instrument or reagent failure. External quality control and SPC
have not changed since the clearance of K140111 and K170308.

Stool Specimens, November 2, 2015.
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-lab precision and reproducibility studies were evaluated previously using unpreserved
stool specimens. This represents the most challenging specimen type and therefore additional
studies were not conducted. See K140111 and K170308 for the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial
Panel and the BD MAX Extended Bacterial Panel, respectively.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical Specificity/Cross-Reactivity: Analytical specificity/cross-reactivity was evaluated
previously in the presence of unpreserved stool which represents the most challenging
specimen type. Please refer to K140111 and K170308. No specificity issues were identified
from additional studies conducted to support testing FecalSwab stool specimens.

An additional specimen stability study was conducted to evaluate specimen stability in
FecalSwab collection tube and corresponding SBT meet the following BD MAX EBP and
BD MAX xEBP assay specimen stability claims:
1. FecalSwab stool specimens before testing: 25 ± 2˚C up to 24 hours (1 day) or 2-8˚C
up to 120 hours (5 days)
2. Specimen added to the BD MAX SBT: 25 ± 2˚C up to 48 hours (2 days) or 2-8˚C up
to 120 hours (5 days)
Three stool pool matrices were contrived from asymptomatic volunteers. All stools were
confirmed negative for target analytes in both panels. Each stool pool was split into two
portions that were used to generate the inoculated positive fecal matrix and un-inoculated
negative fecal matrix. Bacterial mixes were prepared in PBS. For BD MAX EBP targets, two
mixes comprised of Campylobacter/Shigella (BD MAX EBP multiplex mix #1) and
STX/Salmonella (BD MAX EBP multiplex mix #2) were prepared. For BD MAX xEBP
targets, two mixes comprised of Yersinia/ETEC (BD MAX xEBP multiplex mix #1) and
Plesiomonas/Vibrio (BD MAX xEBP multiplex mix #2) were prepared. All positive fecal
matrices were inoculated with bacterial mixes at approximately two times the limit of
detection for each assay. A FecalSwab flocked swab was used to collect sample from the
positive and negative fecal matrices to add to the FecalSwab collection tubes and tested
independently.
On Day 0, FecalSwab collection tubes were prepared with the positive and negative matrices
for testing. Two replicates for each of three FecalSwab collection tube lots were prepared for
each of the three stool pools for a total of 18 positive FecalSwab collection tubes. One
replicate for each of three FecalSwab collection tube lots were prepared for each of the three
stool pools for a total of nine negative FecalSwab collection tubes. For subsequent positive
time points, two positive FecalSwab collection tubes per stool pool were used to prepare four
SBTs for a total of 24 positive replicates. For subsequent negative time points, one positive
FecalSwab collection tube per stool tool was used to prepare two (2) SBTs for a total of six
negative replicates. Table 1 below describes the stability conditions and timepoints.

The acceptance criteria for the study were 100% of spiked positive samples at baseline
should report “POS” as the result and 100% of un-inoculated negative samples at baseline
should report “NEG” as the result. For all subsequent time points, ≥95% of spiked positive
samples should report “POS” as the result and 100% of un-inoculated negative samples
should report “NEG” as the result. To establish specimen stability under any given condition,
the mean Ct value for each organism must be within + 2 Ct of the mean baseline value.
Growth may occur with some bacterial species in the FecalSwab collection tube or SBT
under the storage conditions resulting in lower Ct values.
All target organisms passed the prespecified acceptance criteria except for Campylobacter at
the day six timepoint with <95% of positive samples yielding “POS” results (22/24
replicates). However, all other timepoints with positive Campylobacter samples exhibited
100% “POS” results, therefore the data were considered acceptable for the proposed stability
claim. Stool preserved in FecalSwab collection tubes can be stored for 48 hours (2 days) at
25 ± 2 °C and 120 hours (5 days) at 2 - 8 °C and SBTs inoculated with FecalSwab specimen
can be stored for 48 hours (2 days) at 25 ± 2 °C and 120 hours (5 days) at 2 - 8 °C.
6. Limit of Detection – Equivalency Study
The LoD for each target on the BD MAX EBP and xEBP panels was previously determined
in unpreserved stool specimens and Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens (see K140111 and
K170308). A LoD equivalency study was performed to demonstrate comparable analytical
sensitivity for the BD MAX EBP and xEBP panels testing Cary-Blair preserved stool
samples and FecalSwab preserved stool samples.
Two independent stool pools were prepared consisting of 70% stool and 30% PBS. All stool
samples used to generate stool pools were confirmed negative for all targets. Each stool pool
was divided into six aliquots to which serially diluted target organisms were added.
Multiplex mixes of BD MAX EBP targets (Salmonella, STX, Campylobacter, and Shigella)
and BD MAX xEBP targets (Plesiomonas, Yersinia, Vibrio,and ETEC) prepared in PBS
were used to incoulate stool pool #1 and stool pool #2, respectively. Briefly, each organism

was prepared at 0.5 McFarland turbidity in a single suspension and diluted 1:10 in PBS to
create Concentration #1. Five additional concentrations (Concentrations #2-6) were prepared
by 5-fold serial dilutions from Concentration #1. Concentrations #1-6 were diluted 1:10 into
stool pool mixes #1 and #2. The multiplex mix/stool pool used to inoculate 12 FecalSwab
tubes and 12 Cary-Blair vials. Two SBTs were prepared for each FecalSwab tube or Cary-
Blair tube for a total of 24 SBTs.
Equivalence between the specimen collection methods was confirmed when LoDs for each
target were within one five-fold dilution of each other. LoD is defined as when positivity is
greater than 95% (23/24 or more POS or NEG results).
The LoDs using Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens and FecalSwab stool specimens were
within one five-fold dilution of each other for all EBP and xEBP targets. All analytes met the
acceptance criteria and the results demonstrated comparable analytical sensitivity when
FecalSwab preserved stool specimens and Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens were tested
with BD MAX EBP and xEBP targets on the BD MAX System.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Assay cut-offs remain unchanged from previously cleared versions of the BD MAX EBP
(K40111) and xEBP (K170308).
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable.
9. Carry-Over:
Carry-over was established previously using unpreserved stool in EBP sample buffer which
represents the worst-case scenario for carry-over contamination; therefore, additional studies
were not necessary. Please refer to K140111 and K170308.
10. Detection Limit
Not applicable.
Lead Reviewer or Consulting Reviewer Comments for Internal Discussion Only
The Detection Limit study results are acceptable.
11. User Variability
The objective of this study was to determine whether the preparation of the FecalSwab
collection tube by different users introduces variability in the expected results for the BD
MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP assays on the BD MAX System.
Two different FecalSwab collection tubes were prepared by six different operators for each
of the five panel member stools: one negative panel, three panel members at two times the
limit of detection, and one panel member at four times the limit of detection. LOD panel
K214122 - Page 15 of 23

members consisted of duplex mixes of Campylobacter for the BD MAX EBP and ETEC for
the BD MAX xEBP because both are the most prevalent organisms for their respective
panels and have low LODs. A different and single operator prepared one SBT for each of the
six operators FecalSwab collection tubes. The panels were designed to yield a total of 12
results for the negative panel, 36 results for the 2X LOD panel, and 12 results for the 4X
LOD panel.
For acceptance criteria, 100% negative results for the 12 negative samples, ≥95% positive
results for the 36 samples tested at 2X LoD, and 100% positive for the 12 samples tested at
4X LoD.
Tables 2 and 3 present results for user variability testing with Campylobacter and ETEC,
respectively.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed to demonstrate equivalent performance between
testing FecalSwab stool specimens and Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens with the BD
MAX EBP and xEBP on the BD MAX System.
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Boards or Ethics
Committees. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and in
compliance with ICH Good Clinical Practice. Informed consent was not needed because only
de-identified remnant specimens were enrolled and tested. Fresh prospective specimen were
collected at six external sites. Previously characterized retrospective specimen were collected
at two external sites and one internal site at BD. Samples were also contrived, where
applicable, at an internal BD site. The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were used
for prospective and retrospective specimen collection:
• Prospective inclusion criteria: unpreserved soft to diarrheal stool specimen from a
pediatric or adult patient admitted to a healthcare facility (e.g., hospital, outpatient
clinica, or long-term care facility) and suspected of having acute hasteroenteritis,
enteritis, or colitis for which diagnostic tests were indicated and/or ordered
• Prospective exclusion criteria: unlabeled or mislabeled solid/formed stools or rectal
swabs and specimen from patients suspected and/or confirmed Clostridioides
(Clostridium) difficile diarrheal disease
• Retrospective inclusion criteria: unpreserved stool specimen confirmed positive for
one of the EBP or xEBP targets
• Retrospective exclusion criteria: unlabeled or mislabeled specimens
At clinical sites for prospective specimen, paired FecalSwab and Cary-Blair specimens were
collected from individual unpreserved stool specimens according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Retrospective specimen and contrived samples prepared at the internal BD site
followed the same workflow. Contrived samples were prepared for low prevalence targets,
specifically all of the analytes on the xEBP panel and the Shiga toxin (STX) target on the
EBP panel, to reach the goal of 100 positive test results for each target analyte. A total of 53
positive and 53 negative samples were prepared using 53 unique negative stool specimen
matrices that had been previously determined to be negative for all targeted analytes. Table 4
describes the number of samples at each target level based on the limit of detection for each
analyte.

The primary study endpoint was to demonstrate equivalent performance of testing FecalSwab
stool specimens to the performance of testing Cary-Blair stool specimen with the BD MAX
EBP and xEBP on the BD MAX System using the following for percent agreement
acceptance criteria:
• PPA ≥ 95% for each target
• NPA ≥ 90% for each target
• Lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for PPA and NPA ≥ 90% for each target
Percent agreement comparing the FecalSwab specimen performance to the Cary-Blair
specimen performance with the BD MAX EBP targets is presented in Tables 7-10 and xEBP
targets presented in Tables 11-14.

s. Two contrived samples expected to be positive, but tested negative with the predicate.
These results demonstrate the FecalSwab specimen collection type has comparable and
acceptable performance when compared to the predicate Cary-Blair specimen type with all
targets in the BD MAX EBP and xEBP on the BD MAX System.
Non-Reportable Results:
The rates of unresolved (UNR) results due to sample processing control (SPC) failure and the
rates of indeterminate (IND) results due to a BD MAX System failure were also estimated
