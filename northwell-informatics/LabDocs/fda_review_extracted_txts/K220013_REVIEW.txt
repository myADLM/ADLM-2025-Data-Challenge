The X100HT with Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear Application is intended to locate and
display images of white cells, red cells, and platelets acquired from fixed and stained peripheral
blood smears and assists a qualified technologist in conducting a WBC differential, RBC
morphology evaluation, and platelet estimate using those images. For in vitro diagnostic use
only. For professional use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The X100HT with Slide Loader and Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear automatically locates and
presents images of blood cells on peripheral blood film smears. The user browses through the
imaged smear to gain high-level general impression. The user reviews the suggested
classification of each white cell according to type and may manually change the suggested
classification of any cell. The user can evaluate red cell morphology on observed images. The
user reviews each detected platelet and the suggested platelet estimation and may manually
change the detections or the estimation. The X100HT with Full Field PBS is intended to be used
by skilled users, trained in the use of the device and in the identification of blood cells.
The X100HT with Full Field PBS shares the same intended use as the previously 510(k)-cleared
X100 Full Field PBS (K201301). Specifically, it is comprised of the identical X100 scanner and
Full Field PBS application, but it is assembled with an external Slide Loader, and additional slide
locks were added to the X100 tray. A minor software change to the ‘Scanning’ interface was also
introduced to allow interaction with the Slide Loader. The Slide Loader was designed as an
optional manufacturer assembly part to the cleared X100 scanner, to replace this preliminary
need of a manual mounting media application and a coverslip placement. As with the predicate,
the preparation of the stained blood smear and barcoding of the slide are identical for the
X100HT and are still externally prepared by the user, either manually or by third party devices.
The Slide Loader comes with three cassettes, each cassette may hold up to 10 slides. The user
manually inserts non-cover slipped PBS-stained blood smear slides into the cassettes. In turn, the
Slide Loader, upon the user’s request, adds mounting media, cover slips each slide and loads
them sequentially into the X100 for processing.
B Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
X100HT with Slide Loader with Full Field Peripheral Blood Smear Application
2. Specimen Identification:
The slide’s barcode is captured automatically and assigned to each case. The device also
supports typing the barcode manually.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A peripheral blood sample collected in K2EDTA or K3EDTA tubes is mixed manually or
automatically. A thin blood film is wedged on a clean dry glass slide (a blood smear) and
stained with Romanowsky stain. The user manually places up to 30 slides into 3 extractable
K220013 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
cassettes and inserts them into the Slide Loader. The Slide Loader sequentially inserts the
slides into the scanner. The instrument automatically coverslips and adds immersion oil to
slide for scanning.
4. Calibration:
The Full Field PBS system requires initial calibration for its mechanical and optical
performances. An initial calibration process is performed on a standard blood smear slide as
part of the manufacturing process of the device. The calibration is verified after installation
by a technician or a qualified operator. Calibration can also be performed if a problem arises
in the daily QC testing.
5. Quality Control:
Quality Control (QC) testing is performed on a daily basis (“daily QC”). The daily QC
involves testing a standard blood smear slide prepared on the same day. During the daily QC
the user reviews the images received from the Full Field PBS and verifies that at least 95% of
the WBCs in the scanned image were identified and located correctly by the system. The Full
Field PBS application maintains a digital QC log, enabling the user to review and to track the
history of QC testing performed by the Full Field PBS.

The Scanning page module was changed to support the ‘start scan’ option for a cassette rather
than a slide. The change was tested throughout the different verification and validation tests
for any user interface errors. The study results passed pre-defined acceptance criteria.
7. Automatic Workflow
The Automatic workflow study was performed with 30 clinical peripheral blood smear (PBS)
Romanowsky-stained test slides prepared and collected from three (3) different clinical sites,
seven (7) X100 with Full Field PBS devices (reference device), and three (3) candidate
devices (X100HT). The sample slides represented a variety of clinical conditions that were
included in the original 510(k) study. The study met predefined acceptance criteria including
regression analysis for the four WBC cell types and platelets.
