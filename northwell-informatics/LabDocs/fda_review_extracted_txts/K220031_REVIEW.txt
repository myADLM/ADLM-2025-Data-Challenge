IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Alinity h-series System is a multimodule system that consists of different combinations of
one or more of the following modules: a quantitative multi-parameter automated hematology
analyzer (Alinity hq) and an automated slide maker stainer (Alinity hs).
The Alinity hq is a quantitative, multi-parameter, automated hematology analyzer designed for in
vitro diagnostic use in counting and characterizing blood cells using a multi-angle polarized
scattered separation (MAPSS) method to detect and count red blood cells (RBC), platelets
(PLT), and white blood cells (WBC), and to perform WBC differentials (DIFF) in whole blood.
K220031 - Page 2 of 34

--- Page 3 ---
There is also an option to choose whether to detect reticulocytes at the same time. The options of
the selections are:
• CBC+DIFF: Complete blood count with differential
• CBC+DIFF+RETIC: Complete blood count with differential and reticulocyte
The Alinity h‑series of instruments has a scalable design to provide full integration of multiple
automated hematology analyzers that can include the integration of an automated blood film
preparation and staining module, all of which are controlled by one user interface. The modules
are designed to fit together. Each module has an internal conveyor that enables racks of specimen
tubes to be transported between modules. The system can move racks between modules to
perform different tests on a given specimen (e.g., make slide smears on the Alinity hs).
An Alinity h-series system can be configured as follows:
• Configuration 1: 1 (Alinity hq) + 0 (Alinity hs) = 1+0
• Configuration 2: 1 (Alinity hq) + 1 (Alinity hs) = 1+1
• Configuration 3: 2 (Alinity hq) + 0 (Alinity hs) = 2+0
• Configuration 4: 2 (Alinity hq) + 1 (Alinity hs) = 2+1
The Laboratory Automation System (LAS) is an optional automated track system that connects
to the Alinity h-series through an interface module. The LAS, also known as the Total Lab
Automation (cleared under K121012) is a third-party system used by high-volume laboratories to
manage specimen tubes. It is an externally-manufactured system designed to interface with the
Alinity h-series system.
The following configurations are configurable with the Laboratory Automation System (LAS)
module:
• Configuration 1: 1 (Alinity hq) + 0 (Alinity hs) = 1+0
• Configuration 4: 2 (Alinity hq) + 1 (Alinity hs) = 2+1
The LAS system consists of a command center (coordinates what tests need to run on which
instrument for a sample), track (transports specimen tubes from one instrument to another as
needed), and an interface module (IM).
B Principle of Operation:
The Alinity hq module uses optical and fluorescence flow cytometry, hydrodynamic focusing,
and absorption spectrophotometry technologies to measure, count, and calculate hematological
parameters in samples.
• Optical and fluorescence flow cytometry is a process used to count and measure the
properties of cells or particles as they are carried by fluid through a sensing zone. The
physical and chemical characteristics of cells or particles are measured via light scatter,
polarization, and/or fluorescence response from a laser.
• The Alinity hq uses hydrodynamic focusing to align cells into a single-file passage
through the sensing zone. A cell-free liquid sheath surrounds the diluted sample and
moves with it in a laminar flow. The laminar flow prevents any mixing between the
liquid sheath and the diluted sample.
K220031 - Page 3 of 34

--- Page 4 ---
• Absorption spectrophotometry is based on the linear relationship between the amount of
light that a well-mixed, nonflowing sample absorbs at a particular absorption band and
the concentration of an absorbing entity in the sample (Beer's Law). To perform
absorption spectrophotometry, the system uses the hemoglobin dilution as the sample and
a hemoglobin complex as the light-absorbing entity.
Flow cytometry technologies are used to analyze whole blood samples for WBC, RBC, NRBC,
RETIC, and PLT. Absorption spectrophotometry is used to measure the HGB concentration.
The Alinity hs module creates and stains smears from whole blood samples in addition to
staining externally prepared smears for morphologic review. The operator selects and may
configure staining protocols as needed by the laboratory. The Alinity hs module is configured
with the May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain or the Wright-Giemsa stain.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Alinity h-series System
2. Specimen Identification:
The system supports the use of a bar-coded Sample Identification (SID) on a specimen tube
to provide specimen identification. Specimens are also identified alphanumerically by rack
and tube position number. A bar code reader on the sample handler robot reads the rack ID
bar code to identify the rack number. The rack ID bar code also provides information to
identify the tube position on the rack.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Two methods are used to introduce a specimen to the Alinity hq module. These are closed-
tube processing and open-tube processing.
• In the closed-tube processing mode, capped specimen tubes are introduced to the
Alinity hq module from 10-tube closed-tube racks that are inserted in the loading
area. The module automatically mixes the specimens and moves the tubes to the
aspiration position.
• In the open-tube processing mode, the operator pre-mixes a specimen tube and
removes the cap. The tube is placed in an open-tube sample rack and is inserted in the
loading area. The sample handler robot within the Alinity hq module moves the open-
tube rack that contains the specimen to the open-tube sampling position.
4. Calibration:
Calibration of an Alinity hq module must be scheduled to conform to the guidelines that are
established by regulatory and accrediting agencies.
Calibration is performed using materials with assigned values that are traceable to standard
reference methods. It is recommended that the laboratory calibrate using Alinity h‑series
HemCal, which is a commercial whole blood calibrator.
K220031 - Page 4 of 34

--- Page 5 ---
5. Quality Control:
The Alinity h‑series requires a commercial whole blood control and patient controls to
monitor system performance.

Repeatability
20-Day Within-Laboratory Precision
Three levels of Alinity h-series Control 29P (low, normal, and high) were tested in 2
replicates in CBC+Diff+Retic test selection, 2 times per day (separated by a minimum of 2
hours), on 21 days, for a total of 84 measurements on one instrument in the 2+1
configuration using 1 reagent lot and 1 control lot. Between-run SD and %CV, and between-
day SD and %CV were calculated for each sample by instrument and reagent lot. The within-
laboratory SD and %CV were estimated using the summation of the within-run, between-run,
and between-day variance components. The within-laboratory SD or %CV point estimates
were evaluated against the evaluation criteria. Overall, the Alinity h-series System
demonstrated acceptable long-term precision.

Precision Study – Normal Samples
Samples were collected from 20 unique healthy donors in K2EDTA tubes and tested using
both CBC+Diff and CBC+Diff+Retic test selections. Three Alinity h-series system
instruments of 1+0 configuration and two Alinity h-series system instruments of 2+1
configurations were used. Four (4) samples were tested on each of the three (3) instruments
in the 1+0 configuration and two (2) samples on each of the two instruments in the 2+1
configuration using both CBC+Diff and CBC+Diff+Retic test selections for a minimum of
32 required measurements ([4 samples x 3 instruments] + [2 samples x 2 instruments]) x 2
test selections = 32). Each sample was tested in one (1) run with at least 32 replicates using 1
reagent lot and 1 control lot. The mean value, SD, %CV, minimum and maximum values,
and the two-sided 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) around the SD and %CV were calculated
for each measurand and test selection (CBC+Diff and CBC+Diff+Retic). The maximum

%CV or SD values across donors by range was reported. The SD or %CV point estimates
were evaluated against the evaluation criteria.
The maximum SD/%CV reflects the worst or largest imprecision across all the samples for
each measurand tested for short-term imprecision with whole blood. If the maximum SD or
%CV meets the acceptance criteria for a given measurand, then all the samples tested for
short-term imprecision had SDs/%CVs that also meet the acceptance criteria for that
measurand. All samples were evaluated against all applicable acceptance criteria and met all
acceptance criteria requirements.

a The result ranges may overlap for certain measurands as these reflect the individual replicate values. The
samples are grouped based on their mean values.
Repeatability - Pathological Samples and Medical Decision Levels
Abnormal samples were collected from a minimum of 16 donors per measurand and range. A
minimum of 4 repeatability samples (2 samples using CBC+Diff mode and 2 samples using
CBC+Diff+Retic mode) per measurand and range were tested on each of three 1+0 Alinity
hq analyzers in closed-tube processing mode. A minimum of 4 repeatability samples per
measurand and range were tested on one 2+1 Alinity h-series System (2 samples using
CBC+Diff mode on one Alinity hq module and 2 samples using CBC+Diff+Retic mode on
the other Alinity hq module). Each sample was tested in a minimum of 10 replicates. The
mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and 95% CI were calculated for
each parameter. The SD or %CV point estimates were evaluated against the evaluation
criteria. All results met the predefined acceptance criteria, demonstrating acceptable short-
term precision when testing pathological samples at medical decision levels. A summary
table showing the maximum %CV or SD, across samples by range, for applicable
measurand(s) is presented below.

Reproducibility
The reproducibility study was performed at three clinical sites using a single lot of Alinity h-
series 29P Control (low, normal, high). Each site used a stand-alone (1+0 configuration)
Alinity hq analyzer. Each control level was tested for 5 days with three runs per day and two
replicates per run (one replicate each from the left and right incubation blocks). The within-
run, between-run, between-day, within-laboratory, between-site, and reproducibility %CV or
SD for each control level were calculated and presented in the table below. Overall, the
Alinity h-series System demonstrated acceptable reproducibility for all sites combined using
3 levels of the Alinity h-series 29P Controls. All results met the predefined acceptance
criteria.

2. Linearity:
Linearity for RBC, HGB, and NRBC was determined using whole blood samples that
span the analytical measuring interval of each measurand. Linearity for WBC, PLT,
and RETIC was determined using commercially available linearity kits. A minimum of
9 levels were prepared for each measurand and tested in a minimum of 4 replicates on
3 instruments using 1 reagent lot.
Results are presented in the table below. All results met the predefined acceptance
criteria and were determined to be acceptable.
Measurand Linear Range

RBC 0.00 – 8.08 x 10 /µL
HGB 0.04 – 24.14 g/dL

PLT 0.06 – 5325 x 10 /µL
3
RETIC 0.05 – 644 x 10 /µL
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The susceptibility of the Alinity h-series System to interference in the presence of
hemoglobin, triglycerides, bilirubin, cholesterol, elevated WBCs, elevated RBCs, elevated
PLTs, and microcytic RBCs was tested in venous samples collected in K2EDTA tubes.
Hemoglobin, Triglycerides, Bilirubin, and Cholesterol
For the Hemoglobin, Triglycerides, Bilirubin, and Cholesterol studies, two interferent levels
were tested with samples at the normal measurand levels and at the low measurand levels
listed in the table below.
Measurand Normal Level Low Level
WBC (x103/µL) 3.54 – 9.06 ≤ 3.00
RBC (x106/µL) 4.00 – 5.60 ≤ 3.00
PLT (x103/µL) 165 – 415 ≤ 150
MCV (fL) 80 – 96*
RETIC (x103/µL) 45 – 150
* The MCV measurand is based on the size of the cells rather than the
concentration and therefore, the normal and low levels are the same.
Each sample was tested in a minimum of 10 replicates in CBC+Diff+Retic test selection in
closed tube processing mode. The following measurands were evaluated for each potential
interferent:

The Alinity h-series System was considered not susceptible to interference from bilirubin
(conjugated and unconjugated), cholesterol, hemoglobin, and triglycerides, if the absolute
difference or % difference criteria were met for each measurand.
Elevated WBC, RBC, and PLT
A study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of the Alinity h-series System to
interference from elevated WBC, RBC, and PLT measurands in native whole blood
specimens. This study utilized a subset of samples tested in the method comparison study,
where unique, native whole blood specimens with high WBCs (>30 x 103/μL & ≤100 x
103/μL), high RBCs (> 7.6 x 106/μL), and/or high PLTs (>1000 x 103/μL) collected in
K2EDTA tubes were identified for interference analysis. A minimum of 10 specimens were
evaluated per interferent.
The Alinity h-series System results for WBC, RBC, PLT, MPV, MCV, and HGB were
considered not susceptible to interference from high WBCs, high RBCs, and high PLTs if the
mean difference or mean % difference values for each measurand were within the total
allowable error limits. The total allowable error was used for this analysis because the study
compares the Alinity h-series System and another method (Sysmex XN-10) in specimens
with the interfering condition. Overall, the Alinity h-series System demonstrated no
interference in measuring WBC, RBC, PLT, MCV, and HGB from elevated WBC, RBC, and
PLT measurands in native whole blood specimens.
PLT with Microcytic RBCs
A study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of the Alinity h-series System to
interference from microcytic RBCs to the PLT measurand in native whole blood specimens
with MCV of ≤ 70 fL. This study utilized a subset of samples tested in the method
comparison study, where unique, native whole blood specimens with MCV of ≤ 70 fL
collected in K2EDTA tubes were identified for interference analysis. A minimum of 10
specimens were evaluated per interferent.
This study utilizes specimens with elevated MCV measurand collected in the method
comparison study. Therefore, the total allowable error was used for this analysis because this
study compares the Alinity h-series System and another method (Sysmex XN-10) in
specimens with the interfering condition. For each sample, the difference or % difference
between the Sysmex XN-10 and Alinity h-series System result were compared to the pre-
determined total allowable error limits.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Specimen Stability
Sample stability studies were conducted to evaluate the stability of specimens, venous and
capillary whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA or K3EDTA, when stored under
various conditions (e.g. room temperature and refrigerated).
The results from these studies were used to support the information provided in the system
labeling for the Alinity h-series system when venous and capillary whole blood specimens
collected in either K2EDTA or K2EDTA blood collection tubes are stored for either of the
following:
• Up to 48 hours at refrigerated temperature (2 to 8°C)
• Up to 24 hours at controlled room temperature (18 to 26°C)
Refrigerated K2EDTA Venous and Capillary Whole Blood Specimen Stability
A total of 14 unique native venous whole blood specimens from apparently healthy donors
and 30 unique native capillary whole blood specimens from apparently healthy donors were
collected in K2EDTA blood collection tubes. The samples were tested to evaluate the below-
mentioned conditions and time points in this study.

whole blood specimens were equilibrated to instrument room temperature, as recommended
by the Alinity h-series Operations Manual, for approximately 15 to 30 minutes.
Each venous whole blood specimen was tested at all time points in a minimum of 2 replicates
on the Alinity hq using the CBC+Diff+Retic test selection. If volume permitted, each
capillary whole blood specimen was tested at all time points. For each time point and
condition, the difference between each test time point and the corresponding baseline was
calculated.
Overall, the above specimen stability studies support the proposed system labeling claim for
the stability of venous and capillary whole blood specimens collected in K2EDTA blood
collection tubes when stored for up to 48 hours at refrigerated storage temperature (2 to 8°C).
Controlled Room Temperature K2EDTA Venous and Capillary Whole Blood Sample Stability
A study was conducted to evaluate the stability of K2EDTA venous and capillary whole
blood samples when stored under controlled room temperature conditions (e.g. 18oC and
26oC). The study included 10 K2EDTA venous samples from healthy donors, 10 abnormal
de-identified leftover K2EDTA venous samples, and 20 normal K2EDTA capillary samples
from healthy donors. The time points and storage conditions tested are as summarized below.

≥ 26 Hours to < 28 Hours
For this study, normal venous and capillary specimens were stored in an incubator at the
intended temperature (at 18°C and at 26°C) and timepoints.
The analysis was performed separately for each specimen, time point, storage condition, and
measurand. For each time point and condition, the results for each specimen were compared
to its results at baseline.
Refrigerated and Room Temperature K3EDTA Venous Whole Blood Specimen Stability
A study was conducted to evaluate the stability of venous whole blood specimens collected
in K3EDTA blood collection tubes when stored at refrigerated storage temperature (2 to 8°C)
and at controlled room temperature (18 to 26°C) and then tested on the Alinity h-series
System.
A total of 14 unique, native venous whole blood specimens collected from apparently healthy
donors in K3EDTA blood collection tubes were tested to evaluate the below-mentioned
conditions and time points in this study.

Baseline testing was performed within 4 hours of specimen collection. Aliquots of each
venous whole blood specimen were stored refrigerated at 2 to 8°C and in incubators at the
extreme ends of room temperature (18°C and 26°C). Before each test time point, the aliquots
of the venous whole blood specimens were equilibrated to instrument room temperature, as
recommended by the Alinity h-series Operations Manual.
Each venous whole blood specimen was tested at all time points in a minimum of 2 replicates
on one Alinity hq using the CBC+Diff+Retic test selection. For each time point and
condition, the results for each specimen were compared to its results at baseline.
The results of this specimen stability study support the proposed system labeling claim for
the stability of venous whole blood venous specimens collected in K3EDTA blood collection
tubes when stored for up to 48 hours at refrigerated storage temperature (2 to 8°C) and up to
24 hours at controlled room temperature (18 to 26°C).
Refrigerated and Room Temperature K3EDTA Capillary Whole Blood Specimen Stability
A study was conducted to evaluate the stability of capillary whole blood specimens collected
in K3EDTA blood collection tubes when stored at refrigerated storage temperature (2 to 8°C)
and at controlled room temperature (18 to 26°C) and then tested on the Alinity h-series

Baseline testing was performed within 4 hours of specimen collection. Aliquots of each
capillary whole blood specimen were stored refrigerated at 2 to 8°C and/or in incubators at
the extreme ends of room temperature (18°C or 26°C). Before each test time point, the
aliquots of the capillary whole blood specimens were equilibrated to instrument room
temperature, as recommended by the Alinity h-series Operations Manual.
If volume permitted, each capillary whole blood specimen was tested at baseline and all test
time points for the storage condition. Due to volume constraints, each capillary whole blood
specimen was tested at the time points in a minimum of 1 replicate on the Alinity hq using
the CBC+Diff+Retic test selection.
For each storage condition, test time point, and measurand, the mean of the differences and
% differences, along with the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI), were calculated across
samples. Of note, mean % difference was not calculated for a measurand if any sample had a
baseline result of zero or near zero.
The results of this specimen stability study support the proposed system labeling claim for
the stability of capillary whole blood venous specimens collected in K3EDTA blood
collection tubes when stored for up to 48 hours at refrigerated storage temperature (2 to 8°C)
and up to 24 hours at controlled room temperature (18 to 26°C).
6. Detection Limit:
Limits of Blank, Detection, and Quantitation were established for the WBC, RBC, HGB and
PLT. Testing was conducted over a minimum of 3 days using 2 unique samples per day on
each of 2 test selections (CBC+Diff and CBC+Diff+Retic) in 5 replicates on each of the two
reagent lots. The maximum observed limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit
of quantitation (LoQ) values are summarized below. All results met the predefined
acceptance criteria and were determined to be acceptable.

9. Carry-Over:
Alinity hq susceptibility to potential carryover was evaluated based on guidance from the
Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) document H26-A2.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted to assess the performance of the Alinity hq when
compared to the predicate device, Sysmex XN-10 (K112605). A total of 2,194 unique venous
and/or capillary specimens collected in K2EDTA from pediatric (≤21 years) and adult
subjects including a wide variety of disease states (clinical conditions) were tested across 7
clinical sites.
Venous and/or capillary whole blood leftover specimens were collected in K2EDTA tubes
from a wide range of demographics (age and sex) and disease states (clinical conditions). In
total, there were 1,528 specimens collected from subjects with one or more medical
conditions while there were 244 specimens without any medical conditions. Study sites
aimed to cover the target assay reportable range for the measurands. A maximum of 10%
samples per measurand were permitted to be contrived to cover the entire target assay
reportable range.
Each specimen was tested within 8 hours from the time of collection in one replicate using
either the Closed or Open tube processing mode in the CBC+Diff+Retic test selection on the
Alinity h-series System and one replicate on the Sysmex XN-10 System. Specimens were
tested on the Alinity hq and the Sysmex XN-10 within 2 hours of each other. At five of the
seven sites, the Alinity hq configuration was 1+0 (five stand-alone Alinity hq analyzers), at
one site the configuration was 2+1 (2 Alinity hq modules that are configured as part of the
Alinity h-series System), and at one site both 1+0 and 2+1 configurations were tested.
Alinity hq testing was performed using a minimum of 1 reagent lot, 1 control lot at each site
and a minimum of 1 lot of the Alinity h-series HemCal commercial calibrator. The Sysmex
XN-10/20 was calibrated using its recommended commercial calibrators at each site.
A Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed with the investigational method as the
dependent variable (y) and the predicate method as the independent variable (x). A Deming
regression analysis was used in place of Passing-Bablok analysis where there are very low
numeric values. Bias at medical decision points were also evaluated for each site individually
and for all sites combined. All results were within the predefined acceptance criteria and
found to be acceptable. Overall, the Alinity h-series System demonstrated comparable
performance to the predicate device, Sysmex XN-10/20 (K112605) in an intended use
population in a clinical laboratory setting.

2. Matrix Comparison:
Anticoagulants Comparability - K2EDTA versus K3EDTA
Anticoagulant comparability (K2EDTA versus K3EDTA) was evaluated at three sites (1
internal site and 2 external clinical sites) based on guidance from CLSI EP35. A total of 190
unique donor venous whole blood samples (normal and abnormal) collected in the control
tube type (K2EDTA) and in the evaluation tube type (K3EDTA) were included in the study.
The K2EDTA and K3EDTA whole blood samples for one donor constituted one donor set.
The clinical sites aimed to enroll donor sets that covered all relevant medical decision points
and were representative of the proposed analytical measurement ranges. Comparability
between the anticoagulants was assessed for all measurands based on the mean difference or
% difference and a regression analysis. All reportable parameters that were evaluated met
their predefined bias acceptance criteria.
Matrix Comparability – Venous versus Capillary
A study was conducted to evaluate the comparability of matrices (venous versus capillary)
using whole blood specimens tested on the Alinity h-series System. Paired venous and
capillary samples were obtained from donors (normal and abnormal) in standard K2EDTA
tubes (K981013) (venous, control condition) and Microtainer Microtube for Automated
Process (MAP) Microtubes (K093972) (capillary, test condition). The blood collection tubes
from one individual constituted one donor set. The samples were tested on the Alinity h-
series System (1+0 instrument configuration and 2+1 instrument configuration) in a
minimum of 2 replicates with the CBC+Diff+Retic test selection using a minimum of 1 set of
reagent lots and 1 control lot.
An evaluation was performed, regressing the first valid replicate of each measurand from the
capillary tube (y-axis) against the first replicate of each measurand from the venous tube (x-
axis). The slope and intercept of the regression line, and the two-sided 95% CI around the
slope and intercept were calculated. The predicted bias and % bias, as well as the two-sided
95% CI around the bias and % bias, were calculated around the medical decision points as
applicable. All reportable parameters that were evaluated met their predefined bias
acceptance criteria.

Comparability between the K2EDTA Microtainer Microtube for Automated Process (MAP)
versus K2EDTA Microtainer Capillary tube was evaluated. A total of 44 unique normal
specimens were collected in the Microtainer Microtube for Automated Process (MAP,
K093972) and K2EDTA Microtainer Capillary (K182078) blood collection tube types and
tested in 1 replicate in the open-tube processing mode. Two assessments were performed:
• MAP Open (test condition) vs. MAP Closed (control condition)
• Microtainer Capillary Open (test condition) vs MAP Open (control condition)
Comparability between the capillary tube types was assessed based on the mean difference or
% difference and a regression analysis using either a Passing-Bablok or Deming regression
model. All reportable parameters that were evaluated met their predefined bias acceptance
criteria.
Sample/Tube Processing Mode Comparability - Closed Mode versus Open Mode
Sample processing mode comparability was evaluated. Unique venous specimens (normal
and abnormal) were collected (from 3 testing sites) in K2EDTA tubes. The samples were
tested in a minimum of 2 replicates in the closed tube processing mode (control condition)
and in the open tube processing mode (test condition) using the CBC+Diff+Retic test
selection. The samples were tested on the Alinity h-series System (1+0 instrument
configuration or 2+1 instrument configuration) using a minimum of 1 set of reagent lots and
1 control lot. The Alinity h-series Systems were calibrated at the clinical sites using a
minimum of 1 lot of Alinity h-series HemCal calibrator.
Comparability between the sample/tube processing modes was assessed based on the mean
difference or % difference and a regression analysis using either a Passing-Bablok or Deming
regression model. All reportable parameters that were evaluated met their predefined bias
acceptance criteria.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Sensitivity and specificity performance with the Alinity h-series System were assessed for
accuracy of identifying distributional abnormalities and morphological flags (PLT Clumps,
RBC Fragments) by comparing to a 400-cell differential derived from two independent 200-
cell microscopic reviews of a blood smear (reference method) from negative (normal) and
positive (abnormal) specimens. A subset of 674 venous and capillary specimens collected in
K EDTA for the method comparison study were included in this study. Testing was
2
performed at each of 6 clinical sites. One (1) replicate of each specimen was analyzed using
the CBC+Diff+Retic test selection in the Open or Closed tube processing mode on the
Alinity hq. Three blood films were prepared for each sample.
The final WBC differential and WBC, RBC, and PLT morphology results were based on the
400-cell WBC differential counts derived from the average of 2 concurring 200-cell
differential counts and concordant RBC and PLT morphology results with the exception of
PLT clumps.
K220031 - Page 27 of 34

--- Page 28 ---
Sensitivity and specificity analysis were performed to compare the Alinity hq morphological
flags, WBC 6-part differential, and NR/W against the results from microscopy analysis.
Agreement between 2 readers was determined for %BASO, %EOS, %MONO, %NEU,
%LYM, %IG, and NR/W for the assessment of distributional abnormalities, as well as for
blasts, variant lymphocytes, band neutrophils, RBC fragments, and PLT clumps for the
assessment of morphological abnormalities.
Results from all specimens tested in this study were evaluated against the respective
reference ranges for each differential cell type. Results within the lower and upper limits of
the reference ranges were considered normal (negative). Results not within the lower and
upper limits of the respective reference ranges for Microscopy or Alinity hq were considered
abnormal (positive). Specimens were classified as morphologically abnormal (morphological
positive) based on predefined criteria for Blast, left shift, variant lymphocytes, PLT clumps,
RBC fragments/schistocytes. Distributional classification and morphological flagging were
categorized as True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), and True
Negative (TN) per the following contingency table based on agreement between Alinity hq
and Microscopic results. For this analysis, separate 2x2 tables were constructed in order to
determine sensitivity and specificity for both morphological and distributional abnormalities.

Reference range studies were performed based on guidance from the Clinical Laboratory and
Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP28-A3 to establish adult (> 21 years old) reference
intervals for male and female populations and to establish reference intervals for pediatric
subgroups (neonate [birth to 1 month], infant [> 1 month to 2 years old], child [> 2 to 12 years
old], and adolescent [> 12 to 21 years old]) by evaluating venous or capillary whole blood
specimens collected in K2EDTA from apparently healthy subjects and tested on the Alinity h-
series System.
Adult Reference Range Study
A total of 262 unique venous or capillary whole blood specimens collected in K2EDTA from
apparently healthy male (126) and healthy female (136) adult subjects were tested. The samples

Pediatric Reference Range Study
In the study for pediatric range establishment, prospectively collected or leftover venous or
capillary whole blood specimens collected in K2EDTA blood collection tubes [i.e.,
Vacutainer (K981013) or MAP (K093972) blood collection tubes] were enrolled by the
clinical sites under the IRB-approved clinical study protocol. These prospectively collected
or leftover whole blood specimens were collected from apparently healthy pediatric subjects,
as defined in the IRB-approved clinical study protocol.
The whole blood specimens were tested in a minimum of one replicate on the Alinity hq
using the CBC+Diff+Retic test selection and closed tube processing mode. The samples were
tested on the Alinity h-series System (1+0 instrument configuration or 2+1 instrument
configuration) using a minimum of 1 set of reagent lots and 1 control lot. The Alinity h-series
Systems were calibrated at the clinical sites using a minimum of 1 lot of Alinity h-series
HemCal calibrator.
A total of 320 unique venous or capillary whole blood specimens were included in the

an HCT ranging between 19.3% to 58.1%. K2EDTA slides prepared externally using native
specimens were contrived to have an HCT ranging between 15.0% to 60.0%.
Specimens with a WBC < 4.0 x 103/μL, fragile WBC, abnormal plasma proteins (i.e., cold
agglutinin disease, myeloma), lipemia, icterus, or hemolysis were excluded from the evaluation
of stained smears per CLSI H20-A2*, Section 6.
The slides were evaluated for suitability for microscopy by 2 qualified reviewers using the
criteria per CLSI H20-A2* as detailed below. If their assessment did not agree, a 3rd reviewer
assessed the quality of the same slides. The criteria reviewed included:
• Sufficient working area
• Minimum 2.5 cm in length terminating at least 1 cm from the end of the slide
• Gradual transition in thickness from the thick to the thin areas, ending in a feather edge
• Acceptable morphology within the working area
• Narrower than the slide on which the film is spread, with smooth continuous side margins
that are accessible for oil immersion examination
• No artifact introduced by the technique
• Minimum distributional distortion
• A far end that becomes gradually thinner, without grainy streaks, troughs, or ridges, all of
which indicate an increased number of WBC carried into this area.
The study results were considered acceptable if ≥ 95% of the slides made from K2EDTA and
K3EDTA whole blood and stained with MGG or WG by the Alinity h-series System were
suitable for morphological use.
Overall, the study verified that the Alinity h-series System can prepare acceptable
May-Grünwald-Giemsa and Wright-Giemsa stained smears from venous blood specimens
collected in K2EDTA and K3EDTA anticoagulated tubes.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
