No changes to the sterile barrier (film-film peel-pouch), sterilization method, sterilization
dose and SAL have been made to the device since the original clearance of the Copan
FecalSwab Collection, Transport and Preservation System (K142094).
Shelf Life
The FecalSwab has a claimed shelf life of 15 months. The FecalSwab was verified to meet
performance requirements for enteric bacteria viability through 15 months in the studies
submitted with the original FecalSwab premarket notification (K142094).
Bacterial Recovery (Viability)
Bacterial Recovery (Viability) Studies in the original clearance for the Copan fecal swab
(K142094) did not include Plesiomonas shigelloides (P. shigelloides) (ATCC 14029) as a
claimed organism. P. shigelloides is a claimed organism on the BD MAX EBP and xEBP
panel and as a result P. shigelloides is added to the claimed organisms for the subject device.
All other organisms claimed on the BD MAX EBP and xEBP panel have been previously
validated with viability studies using the subject device (K142094). Recovery studies were
conducted to evaluate the ability of the FecalSwab to maintain viability of P. shigelloides.
The organism was spiked into negative clinical fecal matrix then stored at 20 - 25oC for 48
hrs. and at 2 - 8oC for 72 hrs. The stability study was conducted using three production lots.
Viability studies used the roll plate method and the swab elution method. Different dilutions
of P. shigelloides were contrived using clinical negative fecal matrix followed by
immediately adding the stool and organisms into the subject transport device. The negative
clinical fecal matrix was prepared using formed stools from more than 4 healthy
asymptomatic subjects. The pooled stool was then homogenized in Phosphate Buffer Saline
(PBS) (30% stool in 70% PBS). The media was confirmed to be negative by plating a portion
of each pool on an appropriate agar plate.
To distinguish and count the target colonies in the case of P. shigelloides, in the presence of
resistant flora, a differential and selective agar were used to grow the target organism
(Inositol Brilliant Green Bile Agar). For the swab elution method, the inoculum suspension
was prepared by making a direct suspension in 0.85% physiological saline (pH 6.8-7.2) of
isolated colonies from approximately 1.5 x 108 CFU/ml, (0.5 McFarland standard). This
inoculum was diluted 10 folds in fecal matrix to provide suspensions with concentrations of
1.5 x 104 CFU/ml, 1.5 x 103 CFU/ml, and 1.5 x 102 CFU/mL. 100 µL of an inoculum was
pipetted onto swabs and placed into tubes and stored (T = 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours) (3 lots
used) for each holding temperature or time combination. The zero-time controls were plated
in triplicates for each inoculum concentrations prepared. All other spiked swabs and media
were held at specified temperatures for specific times (at 20-25oC for 6, 24, 48 hrs. and at 2-
8oC for 6, 24, 48, and 72 hrs.). After each specific time point and storage condition, all tubes
were vortexed for a minimum of 5 seconds and the medium was then plated by pipetting 100
µL from each tube onto the appropriate culture medium in triplicates (Inositol Brilliant Green
Bile Agar) and incubated at 35 ± 2oC in an aerobic atmosphere for 24 hrs. The colonies were
then counted (only pink colored colonies were appropriate for counting). The average CFU
was determined for each concentration for each time point and storage condition.
The inoculum for the roll plate method was prepared the same way as the swab elution
method above, with 100 µL aliquots of the prepared inoculum diluted to 1.5 x104, 1.5 x 103
and 1.5 x 102 CFU/ml. The dilutions were transferred into 24-wells at time 0, 6, 24, 48, and
72 hrs. for plating onto the appropriate culture medium and stored at 2-8oC and 20-25oC. The
K220052 - Page 7 of 12

--- Page 8 ---
swab was used to transfer the inoculum into the subject device according to the instructions
for use. Each time point and storage condition were made in triplicate. At each time point
tested, the swabs were removed from the subject device and the media was inoculated on the
surface of Inositol Brilliant Green Bile Agar culture medium plates by rolling the swab
across the surface of the culture media. Plates were incubated at 35-37oC for 24 hrs. with
only pink colonies being counted and the average CFU calculated from 3 plates from each
holding temperature and each concentration.
The acceptance criteria for both bacterial recovery methods were as follows: Cultures from
transport medium tubes held at both 2 - 8oC and 20 - 25oC for 6hrs., 24 hrs., 48 hrs., and
72hrs. for each temperature must remain within 2 log of the initial microorganism
10
concentration (time point 0). All data demonstrated the ability of the FecalSwab to maintain
viability of bacteria under the claimed conditions of use (table 2 and 3).

to test the previously cleared stability claims of 25 ± 2oC for 24 hrs. or 2-8oC for 5 days,
using the subject transport device.
Studies included a nested stability testing to show that specimens stored in FecalSwab
medium at the described conditions (i.e., Day 1: 24 hours in FecalSwab at 25±2°C , Day 3:
24 hours in FecalSwab at 25±2°C + 48 hours at 25±2°C in SBT, Day 6: 24 hours in

FecalSwab at 2-8°C + 5 days at 2-8°C in SBT) continued to be stable at 2-8oC for up to 120
hours (5 days) or at 25 ± 2oC for up to 48 hours. The study included four panels consisting of
two different organisms mixed into each panel. Each panel used clinical matrix and was
contrived at a concentration of 2 x LoD (Table 4). The acceptance criteria for the Fecalswab
were a minimum of 95% detection for all targets at 2-8oC for up to 120 hours (5 days) or at
25 ± 2oC for up to 48 hours when SBT was used as described above in parentheses and
results showed that each organism tested for both BD MAX EBP and xEBP had ≥ 95%
detection at all the target storage stability time points claimed in the package insert (as shown
in Table 5).

6. Detection Limit (LoD):
LoD studies were performed to determine the analytical sensitivity with the BD MAX EBP
and BD MAX xEBP System when used with the FecalSwab specimen collection device has
similar analytical performance compared to raw stool when used with these systems. The
pooled negative clinical stool matrix was pre-tested with an FDA cleared assay for each
target organism and determined to be negative prior to use. The stool matrix was used as a
negative sample or was spiked to generate positive samples with the following organisms:
Salmonella typhimurium, ATCC 14028; Escherichia coli STX1, ATCC 43890;
Campylobacter jejuni, ATCC 43429 and Shigella sonnei, ATCC 9290. A 0.5 McFarland
standard was made for each organism and further diluted. The 0.5 McFarland was confirmed
with culture to determine the CFU/mL concentration, each organism was then serially diluted
down to the LoD. The LoD is reported in CFU/mL.
150 µL each of the inoculated stool samples was used to spike 12 tubes of the FecalSwab
transport medium according to the IFU. After inoculation, 50 µL of each inoculated
FecalSwab tube specimens were transferred into a total of 24 BD MAX sample buffer tubes
(SBTs) in parallel according to the manufacturer’s instructions for BD MAX assays. This
procedure was repeated for each dilution and mix. The external controls were processed and
tested as described in the BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP IFUs. The LoD is the
concentration at which > 95% of the sample tested positive. Table 6 and 7 include the LoD
concentrations of organisms in CFU/mL when FecalSwab specimens were tested with the
BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP.

For each organism tested across both the BD MAX enteric bacterial panel and extended
bacterial panel, an LoD was identified. These results support that the FecalSwab has
equivalent analytical performance to raw stool when used with BD MAX EBP and BD
MAX xEBP cleared devices.
Analytical Specificity-False positivity
The analytical specificity of the BD MAX System when used with the FecalSwab specimens
was evaluated using data generated from the storage stability studies. This study was
designed to demonstrate that the FecalSwab medium does not interfere with BD MAX EBP
and BD MAX xEBP SBTs resulting in false positive results. Three lots of negative pooled
stool matrix were prepared from 4 healthy, asymptomatic volunteers and homogenized in
PBS to serve as negative fecal matrix (30% stool and 70% PBS). All of the FecalSwab tubes
with the negative fecal matrix were processed according to the package insert. These samples
were then tested on the BD MAX systems after generating two SBTs from each individual
collection tube initially inoculated (3 Copan FecalSwab lots were used). Data from the
FecalSwab media and negative fecal matrix is presented in table 8. Testing resulted in no
false positive results.

Cross-Reactivity of FecalSwab Specimens with BD MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP
Cross-Reactivity studies were conducted and validated in the original clearance of the BD
MAX EBP and BD MAX xEBP using unpreserved stool. In the previous clearance
unpreserved stool was determined to be the most challenging specimen type. The FecalSwab
collection device has no impact on the genetic sequences of potentially cross-reacting
