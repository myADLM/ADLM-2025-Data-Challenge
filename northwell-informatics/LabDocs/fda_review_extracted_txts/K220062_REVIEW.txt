µL specimen volume and minimal hands-on time, and the results are available in
approximately 78 minutes.
B Principle of Operation:
The QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 is part of the QIAstat-Dx system and works with the
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0.
The QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 is intended to be used with stool samples collected in
Para-Pak C&S or FecalSwab transport media.
Once the cartridge has been inserted into the instrument, the test starts automatically and runs for
approximately 78 minutes. he QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 automatically interprets test results and
displays a summary on the analyzer display screen.
Sample Pre-treatment for PCR Inhibitors removal
Following insertion of the cartridge, the buffer located in Reservoir 1 is added inside the lysis
chamber and homogenized with the sample using a rotor in the presence of silica beads. This
enables separation of commonly found inhibitory substances in stool from the DNA/RNA by
chemical means.
Resuspension of Internal Control (IC) and Proteinase K
Following sample pre-treatment, the IC and Proteinase K is resuspended with the buffer located
in Reservoir 2 (resuspension buffer). The buffer from Reservoir 2 is added to the interconnected
IC cavity and Proteinase K cavity and transferred repeatedly between the Transfer Chamber and
the cavities to ensure resuspension. The resuspended IC and Proteinase K are transferred to the
sample cavity.
Cell Lysis
Primary lysis of the cells and analytes present in a stool sample and IC occurs by a combination
of chemical and mechanical processes using a rotor inside the lysis chamber in the presence of
silica beads and a buffer that acts as a chemical agent in aiding the mechanical process. The fast
movement of the rotor in the presence of the silica beads results in sample agitation, which
creates turbulence and shear forces that favor the lysis of the cell wall.
After mechanical lysis is completed, the primary lysate is transferred to the purification chamber
through a frit with 2-5 μm pore size. The second lysis buffer (from Reservoir 3) is added to the
primary lysate to complete chemical lysis.
Purification
Binding reagent (from Reservoir 4) is added to the lysate in the purification chamber, and the
mix is passed through the silica membrane. In this process, the DNA/RNA molecules stick to the
membrane, and the remaining components of the lysate are delivered to the waste chamber. Then
the membrane is washed with a first washing buffer (from Reservoir 5) to wash away proteins.
This is followed by a second washing step with a second washing buffer (from Reservoir 6) to
remove any remaining substances other than the nucleic acids. A subsequent drying step
K220062 - Page 4 of 66

--- Page 5 ---
eliminates volatile substances from the silica membrane. Prior to the elution step, the Transfer
Chamber is rinsed with the rinsing buffer (from Reservoir 7) in order to remove any potential
inhibitors from previous processing steps. At the end of the process, the nucleic acids are
released from the membrane using an elution buffer (from Reservoir 8). The eluate is collected in
the Transfer Chamber.
Rehydration of Master Mix
A defined volume (135 μL) of the eluate is delivered to the reservoir of the Dry Chemistry
Container (DCC) to rehydrate the Master Mix. Any remaining eluate is transferred to the
Reservoir 7. The eluate/Master Mix solution is mixed by repeated transfer between the Transfer
Chamber and the DCC.
Aliquoting and PCR
Defined aliquots (15 μL) of mixed eluate/Master Mix are sequentially transferred from the
Transfer Chamber to each of eight Reaction Chambers containing the specified, air dried primers
and probes.
Within each Reaction Chamber, a reverse-transcription step followed by real time, multiplex
PCR (“rtPCR”) is performed. Increase in fluorescence (indicative of detection of each target
analyte) is detected directly within each Reaction Chamber.
The rtPCR process is conducted by two submodules of the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0: the
Thermal Cycler and the qPCR Sensor.
Components Description
QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 Cartridge:
The QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 cartridge is a disposable plastic device that allows
performing fully automated molecular assays. The main features of the QIAstat-Dx
Gastrointestinal Panel 2 cartridge for the Gastrointestinal assay include the ability to test liquid
samples and the capacity to store all necessary reagents within the cartridge needed for such
testing. All sample preparation and assay steps will be performed within the cartridge.
All the reagents required for the complete execution of the test are pre-loaded and self-contained
in the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2. The user does not need to manipulate any reagents.
During the test, reagents are handled by pneumatically operated microfluidics without any direct
contact with the user or the analyzer actuators. This eliminates any possibility of exposure of the
user or the analyzer to chemicals contained in the cartridge during the test and up to the disposal
of used cartridges.
Reagents may be found in three different physical forms: liquid, air-dried on surfaces or
lyophilized powder cake.
Within the cartridge, multiple steps are automatically performed in sequence by using pneumatic
pressure and a multiport valve to transfer sample and fluids via the Transfer Chamber to their
intended destinations.
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0
K220062 - Page 5 of 66

--- Page 6 ---
The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 is the unit that hosts a cartridge and, on command from the user, is
able to run predefined assay protocols. The software specific to this test is pre-loaded on the
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0.
Other Materials
Each QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 cartridge will be used with a transfer pipette (provided
with device). The stool sample from the patient will be collected in Cary-Blair medium
following the manufacturer’s instructions for use (not provided with device).
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 – the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 cartridge can only be run on
the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0.
Calibrators and/or Controls
Blank controls are not applicable to the device because it is a single test disposable cartridge.
Negative and positive external controls are recommended but not provided with the QIAstat-Dx
Gastrointestinal Panel 2.
QIAGEN provides an internal control (“IC”) within the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2
cartridge which provides a full process control covering lysis, nucleic acid purification, reverse
transcription and DNA amplification. The IC is Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The IC is located
in the IC cavity and is mixed with the sample during sample preparation and the eluate is mixed
with the Master Mix, then aliquoted in all Reaction Chambers. The results screen displays a
message indicating that the Internal Control “Passed” when the test is run successfully. An IC
message of “Failed” indicates that the internal control was not amplified; ‘Positive’ test results
are then reported as POSITIVE* (positive with warning), all ‘Negative’ results are invalid.
The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 is provided factory calibrated and does not require user
calibration. The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 includes self-check controls to verify the performance
of all sensors and actuators and will alert the user in case of failure.

samples or negative samples
spiked with well characterized
organisms as external positive
controls.	
	General Device Characteristic Differences				
Assay Targets			No additional targets to those
listed above which are in
common with the predicate
device.	The FilmArray Gastrointestinal
Panel has four additional
targets: Clostridium difficile (C.
difficile) toxin A/B,
Enteroaggregative Escherichia
coli (EAEC), Sapovirus and a
generic Vibrio target which
differentiates Vibrio cholerae.	
Specimen Types			Human stool sample collected
in Para-Pak C&S and
FecalSwab transport media.	Human stool sample collected in
Cary Blair transport media	
Nucleic Acid
Extraction			Extraction of nucleic acids using
silica membrane	Extraction of nucleic acids using
magnetic beads	
Technology			QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal
Panel 2 detection of amplified
targets uses an increase in
fluorescence due to specific
probe binding to generate the
assay results.	The FilmArray Gastrointestinal
Panel uses melting curve analysis
to confirm the identity of

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Reproducibility/Repeatability:
Reproducibility Study
Reproducibility testing evaluating contrived samples was performed at three test sites, including one
internal site (Site A) and two external sites (Site B and Site C). The study incorporated a range of
factors that may introduce variability in assay results, including sites, days, replicates, cartridge lots,
operators, and QIAstat-Dx analyzers. For each site, testing was performed across five non-
consecutive days with two replicates per day (total of 30 replicates per target, concentration, and
site), four QIAstat-Dx Analyzers (two analyzers per operator and per site), and at least two operators
on each testing day. A total of five sample mixes (including evaluation of analyte levels
corresponding to 1x LoD and 3x LoD as well as negative samples containing no analyte) were
prepared in a matrix consisting of pooled stool in Para-Pak C&S transport medium. For each mix, six
replicates were tested and evaluated, and data obtained at all three sites were compiled to calculate
the two-sided 95% Confidence Interval by target and concentration.
The percent agreement with expected results for all analytes was ≥95% for samples tested at 1x and
3x LoD, meeting the acceptance criteria for the study. All analytes evaluated were detected within
performance expectations for qualitative agreement across all concentrations tested. The
Reproducibility Study site-to-site qualitative results (agreements with expected results) are
presented in Table 1 below.

1 Three (3) Adenovirus F40/41 false positives were observed when testing negative sample. Retesting of the three
samples resulted in the expected negative results.
2 One (1) Giardia lamblia false positive was observed when testing a positive sample not containing the pathogen.
Repeat testing of this sample resulted in the expected negative result.
3 The Reproducibility study was fully re-tested for Rotavirus A with a new sample set due to an unexpected number
of false negatives for Rotavirus A at the 1x LoD concentration. This was observed with during an interim data
evaluation (61/72, 84.7%) and that was attributed to the sample manufacture and while unrelated to the study workflow
variables (operator, lot, day, instrument and site). Test runs derived from Rotavirus A new sample set resulted in 90/90
(100%; 95.98-100% CI) for the 3x LoD and 89/90 (98.89%; 93.96-99.97% CI) for the 1x LoD. During this testing,
one (1) Campylobacter false positive was observed Retesting of this sample resulted in the expected negative result.
4 Only applicable for Para-Pak C&S samples
During the study, there were three false positive results for Adenovirus F40/41 in negative (non-
spiked) samples as well as one false positive result for Campylobacter and one false positive
result for Giardia lamblia in samples containing other analytes. Repeat testing of the same five
samples yielded the expected negative result for each applicable analyte. The investigation into
the unexpected false positive results showed that these events were observed in five different
analyzers. For the sample that was false positive for Campylobacter, the sample tested
immediately prior was also positive for Campylobacter. For the other four false positive samples,
the samples run immediately prior were not positive for the applicable pathogen suggesting that
these unexpected results were likely not due to inter-run carryover.

A total of six cartridge failures (6/645, 0.93%) were observed during the study. Failures included
cartridge errors (5) and an instrument error (1). No invalid results due to internal control failure
were observed.
An additional analysis of variation was conducted across specific potential sources of variability
such as sites, days, replicates, cartridge lots, operators, and QIAstat-Dx analyzers. Results from
the analysis showed no significant contribution to variability (Standard Deviation and
Coefficient of Variation values below 1 and 5%, respectively) caused by any of the assessed
variables. Overall, Ct variability was low, and the study demonstrates assay variability within an
acceptable range. Results are presented in Table 2 below.

Repeatability Study:
To further assess the precision of the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2, an in-house
repeatability study was conducted using a set of samples containing analyte concentrations of 3X
LoD and 1X LoD as well as negative samples prepared in stool matrix in Para-Pak C&S
transport medium. Specifically, pathogens included in the positive samples were Adenovirus,
Campylobacter, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Norovirus GII, Rotavirus, Salmonella
enterica, and Yersinia enterocolitica, in addition to Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), STEC
stx1/stx2, and E. coli O157 which are only applicable for Para-Pak C&S samples. Each panel
member was tested with the same instrument over 12 days. In total, 60 replicates at 1x LoD and
60 replicates at 3x LoD per each of the tested targets and 60 negative samples were run in the
study. Overall results showed a 93.33-100% and 95.00-100% detection rate for 1x LoD and 3x
LoD samples, respectively. Negative samples showed 100% of negative calls for all panel
analytes. One failed run due to a cartridge error occurred during the study (1/426, 0.23%).
Testing results met the study acceptance criteria demonstrating acceptable repeatability of the
QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical Specificity/Cross-Reactivity
The Analytical Specificity study was performed to demonstrate the absence of cross-
reactivity between the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 assay on-panel microorganisms
and viruses (intra-panel cross-reactivity) and between on-panel and off-panel
microorganisms/viruses (i.e., organisms not covered by the panel and therefore not intended
to be detected by the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2).
Samples were prepared by single spiking microorganisms/viruses at high concentrations into
negative stool resuspended in Para-Pak C&S transport medium. Sample concentrations tested
were 1.0E+06 CFU/mL for bacteria, 1.0E+05 TCID50/mL for viruses and 1.0E+05 cells/mL
for parasites, or the highest available concentration based on the pathogen stock. Testing was
conducted in triplicate.

Study results indicated no false positive results for on-panel or off-panel analytes with the
exception of two non-targeted Campylobacter species (C. helveticus and C. lari) that cross-
reacted with the Campylobacter assay oligonucleotides included in the QIAstat-Dx
Gastrointestinal Panel 2. The on-panel and off-panel microorganisms/viruses evaluated in the

likely to be found in stool specimens. Substances included endogenous, exogenous as well as
technique-specific substances.
Testing included samples containing negative clinical stool matrix in Para-Pak C&S medium
with and without the addition of each potentially interfering substance. Samples containing
organism mixes with one strain for each targeted pathogen were tested at a concentration of 3x
LoD. Testing was performed in triplicates. Additionally, for endogenous substances, negative
specimens (stool matrix in Para-Pak C&S medium matrix with no organism mix) were
spiked with only the test substance to evaluate the potential for false positive results due to
the test substance itself.
For the majority of substances tested, no interference was observed, with the exceptions of
mucin, calcium carbonate, nonoxynol-9, and Rotavirus reassortants which demonstrated
interference at high concentrations.
The mucin at 5% w/v sample generated unexpected false positives results for the Yersinia
target. These results were investigated by testing the interfering substance with an FDA-
cleared method that also detected Yersinia in the sample, demonstrating that the unexpected
positive results were not due to mucin interference.
Calcium carbonate at concentrations above 0.5% w/v was found to generate false negative
results for all the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 targets and the internal control.
Nonoxynol-9 at concentrations above 0.02% v/v was found to generate false negative results
for detection of Entamoeba histolytica.
As expected, Rotavirus reassortants WC3:2-5, R574(9) and WI79-4,9 used in Rotavirus A
vaccines generated positive results for Rotavirus A in the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel
2. Final concentrations without interference (i.e., no false positive results for Rotavirus) for
WC3:2-5, R574(9) and WI79-4,9 were 8.89x10–5 TCID /mL and 1.10 PFU/mL,

respectively.
The strains used for sample mixes tested in the study are presented in Table 6. Results from

Microbial Interference:
A microbial interference study was conducted to assess whether non-target
microorganisms/viruses can interfere with the detection of panel targets. Clinically relevant
and challenging concentrations of non-target organisms (1.0E+06 x 106 CFU/mL for
bacteria, 1.0E +05 cells/mL for yeast and 1.0E+05 TCID /mL for viruses) were individually
50
co-spiked with each of the targeted pathogens (Table 6 above) at 3x LoD. Samples were
prepared in negative stool matrix in Para-Pak C&S transport medium. Testing was performed
in triplicate. Microbial interference was not observed as all combinations and replicates
tested successfully detected all the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 targets. Results from
the study are presented in Table 8.

Competitive Interference
The potential for competitive interference was evaluated for a subset of analytes detected
by the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2. The samples were prepared as a combination
of two targeted pathogens in stool matrix (negative pooled stools resuspended in Para-Pak
C&S transport medium) with one pathogen spiked at a high concentration (50x LoD) and
the other spiked at a low concentration (3x LoD). Testing was conducted in triplicate. No
false positives or false negative results were observed during the study. Results are
presented in Table 9.

Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity) testing was conducted to assess the ability of the QIAstat-
Dx Gastrointestinal panel 2 to detect gastrointestinal pathogen isolates/strains that were
selected based on clinical relevance as well as temporal, geographical and phylogenetic
diversity. Samples were prepared with pathogen mixes in negative stool matrix collected in
Para-Pak C&S transport medium. Based on the previously established LoD for each assay
target, three serial log dilutions were tested with four replicates per concentration and per
strain/isolate. The lowest concentration for which all four replicates were detected was
identified and two more replicates were tested for a total of six sample replicates. Most
pathogen strains evaluated (104/114) were detected at ≤3-fold of the corresponding LoD
reference strain. Less than 100% detection was observed for one strain each of ETEC,
EIEC/Shigella and Rotavirus and two strains each of STEC (one STEC O157), Adenovirus
and Norovirus when tested at a concentration of <3x LoD. Testing of these strains at 10x
LoD generated the expected positive resulted for all replicates. For each strain evaluated in
the study, the lowest concentration (based on a factor of LoD) that generated positive results
for 6/6 replicates are presented in tables 10-26 below. LoD reference strains are shown in
bold for each targeted analyte.
An additonal evaluation of inclusivity for the QIAstat-Dx GI Panel 2 targets was conducted
using in silico analysis of bacterial, viral, and parasite strains with available sequences in the
database. All single primers and probes used for detection of each assay target included in the
QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 were analyzed to predict the reactivity of the panel using
BLAST. Further analysis of the predicted reactivity was performed through alignment

Table 27 below.
Based on the results observed for inclusivity in vitro (wet) testing and in silico analysis, the
QIAstat-Dx GI Panel 2 primers and probes are inclusive for each targeted analyte for
clinically relevant strains, including species, subspecies, subtypes, serotypes or serovars, as
applicable.

Sample Stability
A study was conducted to evaluate the stability of stool specimens collected in Para-Pak
C&S or FecalSwab transport media that are stored under claimed storage conditions (i.e., up
to four days at room temperature (15°C to 25°C) or four days at refrigerated conditions (2°C
to 8°C)). After storage under each storage condition, samples were tested with QIAstat-Dx
Gastrointestinal Panel 2. For Para-Pak C&S, at least one strain was evaluated for each
reportable analyte (26 strains). For FecalSwab, 11 representative bacterial, viral, and parasite
strains were evaluated. Individual samples were prepared by spiking mixtures of up to seven
different analytes at 2.5x LoD into human stool matrix in Para-Pak C&S and FecalSwab
transport media. The study acceptance criteria to support claims for each storage condition
required at least 90% (e.g., ≥9/10) of test replicates to generate a positive signal for each
spiked pathogen. Sample replicates were tested fresh as well as after each day of storage at
room temperature or refrigerated conditions.
Overall, all tested conditions resulted in a detection rate of ≥90% for all strains and storage
conditions except for the following:
• For Para-Pak C&S, one strain of Cyclospora cayetanensis showed <90% detection at
several time points for both refrigerated and room temperature storage. These results
were found to be due to samples that were prepared at levels below the LoD. Testing
of newly prepared samples generated the expected positive results for each test
condition evaluated.
• For Para-Pak C&S, one strain of Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC)/Shigella (EIEC, ATCC
43892) showed <90% detection at multiple time points for samples stored at room
temperature. Retesting of additional replicates for this strain generated the expected
positive results. An additional Shigella strain (Shigella sonnei (ATCC ref. 25931)
was also evaluated and generated acceptable results for all test conditions.
Overall results of the sample stability study support the following storage conditions for stool
specimens resuspended in Para-Pak C&S and FecalSwab transport media before testing with
the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2:
• Room temperature up to 4 days at 15–25˚C
• Refrigerated up to 4 days at 2–8˚C
Assay Controls
External Controls
External Controls are not provided with the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2. The
following information regarding external control testing is included in the Instructions for
Use:
K220062 - Page 36 of 66

--- Page 37 ---
• All external quality control requirements and testing should be performed in
accordance with local, state, and federal regulations or accreditation organizations
and should follow the user’s laboratory standard quality control procedures.
• Blank controls are not applicable to the device because it is a single test disposable
cartridge. Regular testing of negative and positive external controls is recommended
by the company but controls are not provided with the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal
Panel 2. Use transport media as the external Negative Control, and previously
characterized positive samples or negative sample spiked with well characterized
target organisms as external positive controls.
Internal Control
The QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel Cartridge includes a full process Internal Control,
which is titered Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a yeast
(fungus) that is included in the cartridge in dried form and is rehydrated upon sample
loading. This Internal Control material verifies all steps of the analysis process, including
sample homogenization, lysis of viral and cellular structures (by means of chemical and
mechanical disruption), nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR. A
passed result for the Internal Control indicates that all processing steps performed by the
QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel Cartridge were successful. A failed result of the Internal
Control does not negate any positive results for detected and identified targets, but it does
invalidate all negative results in the analysis. Therefore, the test should be repeated if the
Internal Control signal is negative.
Expected Values:
See Section VII(E) below
6. Detection Limit:
To establish the limit of detection (LoD) for each of the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2
targets, a total of 36 pathogen strains were evaluated in samples prepared from serial
dilutions of culture isolates or positive clinical samples. Samples were prepared in human
stool matrix, consisting of a pool of previously tested negative clinical stool specimens
resuspended in Para-Pak C&S transport medium.
The LoD was established as the lowest concentration at which ≥95% of replicates are
detected. A minimum of 20 replicates were tested to confirm the LoD for each strain.
Additional testing of samples with concentrations below the LoD (0.3x LoD) demonstrated
<95% detection, confirming the LoD results. LoD results for each microorganism/virus
tested are presented in Table 28.

7. Carryover/Cross-Contamination Study:
A study was performed to evaluate the potential for carryover or cross-contamination
between consecutive runs when using the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 on the
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0. Samples were prepared in stool matrix in Para-Pak C&S transport
medium. Testing included alternating high-positive samples (1.0E+06 CFU/mL for bacteria,
1.0E+05 TCID for viruses, or 1.0E+05 organisms/mL for parasites) and negative samples.
50
A total of 31 positive samples and 31 negative samples were tested over five days using two
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 instruments. Results from testing generated the expected results for
all positive and negative samples, demonstrating no carryover or cross-contamination for the
QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 when run on the QIAstat-Dx analyzer. Analyte mixes
used to prepare high positive samples are presented in Table 29.

8. Transport Media Equivalency Study:
A transport media equivalency study was conducted to assess potential performance
differences between Para-Pak C&S and FecalSwab transport devices. Specimens tested in the
study were prepared using raw clinical stool specimens that were known positive for
representative analytes detected by the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2. Each positive
raw stool was inoculated into both Para-Pak C&S and FecalSwab transport media in
accordance with the instuctions for use for each transport device. Positive percent agreement
(PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated based on comparison to the
expected result. Results from testing demonstrated equivalent performance between the two
transport media, when compared to the expected positive and negative results for each
analyte evaluated. Results for positive and negative agreement are presented in Tables 30 and
31 respectively.

Additonal testing was conducted using individual negative stool matrices spiked with
selected target analytes at concentrations of 2x, 5x and 10x LoD. Positive stool samples were
inoculated into Para-Pak C&S and FecalSwab transport devices. Testing demonstrated
equivalent performance for all analytes for contrived clinical specimens in Para-Pak C&S
and FecalSwab transport devices. Results from testing demonstrated equivalent analytical
performance between Para-Pak C&S and FecalSwab transport media. Results for positive
and negative agreement for testing of contrived specimens are presented in Tables 32 and 33
respectively.

To support inclusion of frozen archived Para-Pak C&S clinical specimens in the clinical
study, an equivalency study was conducted to demonstrate equivalent performance between
fresh and frozen specimens. Samples for the study were prepared by spiking different
pathogen strains at low concentrations (i.e., 2x LoD) into stool sample matrix in Para-Pak
C&S transport medium. Fresh (non-stored) samples were tested immediately after
preparation. Frozen sample aliquots were stored at -70 to -80ºC or -15 to -25°C) and for at
least 46 days and subjected to two freeze and thaw cycles prior testing. Results from the
study demonstrated equivalent performance between fresh and frozen stool samples in Para-
Pak C&S medium. Results are presented in Table 34.

10. Sample Volume Equivalency Study: 200 µL versus 100 µL sample volumes:
When an error message is generated by the QIAstat-Dx analyzer indicating that the sample
concentration is too high, the user is instructed to repeat testing with half the sample volume
(100 µL). This error is most likely to occur when transport media containers are overfilled.
To assess the potential for an impact to assay performance when testing the lower sample
volume, an equivalency study was conducted comparing testing with a 100 µL sample input
volume to the standard sample input volume (200 µL). Samples were prepared by spiking
analyte mixes containing one strain for each targeted analyte at 1x LoD in stool matrix
resuspended in Para-Pak C&S transport medium. Results from the study demonstrated
equivalent results between the two sample input volumes and for all assay targets, with the
exception of Adenovirus F40/F41, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Entamoeba histolytica, STEC,
and E. coli O157. For these targets, additional testing was conducted to determine the assay
LoD for samples tested using the 100 µL sample volume. For these four analytes, the LoD

when testing a 100 µL sample volume was 3.16x higher than the LoD for samples tested
with a 200 µL sample volume. Results from the study are presented in Table 36 below.
The following limitation statements are included in the package insert to warn the user of
the risk of overfilling Para-Pak C&S or FecalSwab collection devices and the potential for
lower assay sensitivity for the four analytes when testing with the 100 µL sample volume:
• The overfilling of Para-Pak C&S or FecalSwab collection devices can result in a failed
test with an error indicating ' Sample concentration too high’.
• The assay sensitivity to detect Cyclospora cayetanensis, Adenovirus F40/F41,
Entamoeba histolytica and the Shiga-like toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC)
might be reduced up to 3.16-fold when using half-input sample volume (100 µL)

*New LoD for testing 100 µL sample volume was determined to be 3.16x higher than the LoD for testing 200 µL
sample volume.
The study results support that the risk to clinical performance when testing the reduced sample
volume is likely to be minimal as the new LoD was only 3.16-fold higher for the five analytes
listed above.

C Clinical Studies:
Prospective Clinical Study:
The clinical performance of QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 was established during a multi-
center international prospective study conducted at thirteen clinical settings representative of
different geographical areas within the US and Europe (nine sites in US and four sites in Europe)
between May and July 2021. All study sites were hospital-associated or independent clinical
diagnostics laboratories that perform routine diagnostics of gastrointestinal infections. A total of
1939 prospectively collected evaluable stool specimens (stool in Para-Pak C&S (Meridian
Bioscience) or FecalSwab (COPAN) transport media) were obtained from patients with clinical
indications of diarrhea caused by gastrointestinal infection. For the 1939 evaluable specimens
tested in the prospective study, Table 37 provides a summary of specimen distribution across all
study sites and Table 38 includes a summary of patient demographic information.

The performance of the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 was evaluated for each panel test
result using one FDA-cleared test as comparator for the most analytes. A composite comparator
consisting of either three independent FDA-cleared test methods or two independent FDA-
cleared tests methods and two validated PCR assays followed by bi-directional sequencing was
used for Norovirus GI/GII, ETEC, STEC and Giardia lamblia (Table 39).

adequate quality that by BLAST analyses matched a sequence of the expected organism or gene from NCBI
GenBank database with at least 95% query coverage and at least 95% identity compared to the reference.
Where a composite comparator was used, the result was determined as the majority of the three
individual test results (i.e., a positive composite comparator result is based on positive results for
at least two comparator tests and a negative composite comparator result is based on negative
results for at least two comparator tests). If insufficient pathogen positive sample was available
to obtain a majority test result, a worst-case model was applied in the PPA calculation. In this
model, the PPA was calculated including all observed true positive and false negative samples
between QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 and the composite comparator, while the following
procedure was used for the samples where it was not possible to conduct testing with the
complete comparator due to insufficient sample volume:
• Samples that were negative for the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 and positive for
one comparator test, negative (or insufficient volume) for a second comparator, and
insufficient volume for a third comparator were included in the calculations as worst-case
false negatives.
• Samples that were positive for the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 and positive for
one comparator test, negative (or insufficient volume) for a second comparator, and
insufficient volume for the third comparator, were considered as worst-case false
positives and therefore excluded from the PPA calculations.
The PPA was calculated as 100% x (TP / (TP + FN)). True positive (TP) indicates that both the
QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 and comparator method showed a positive result for the
specific target, and false negative (FN) indicates that the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2
result was negative while the comparator method result was positive. The NPA was calculated as
100% x (TN / (TN + FP)). True negative (TN) indicates that both the QIAstat-Dx
Gastrointestinal Panel 2 and the comparator method showed negative results, and a false positive
(FP) indicates that the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 result was positive when the
comparator method result was negative. The exact binomial two-sided 95% confidence intervals
for PPA and NPA were calculated.
Discrepancies between the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 and the comparator methods were
investigated for the analytes where the QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 test result was
compared to one FDA-cleared method. Discrepant result analyses are footnoted in the clinical
performance summary table.
Results for the prospective clinical study are presented in Table 40.

The QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 reported multiple organism detections (i.e., mixed
infections) for a total of 15 and 29 prospective specimens in FecalSwab and Para-Pak C&S,
respectively. This represents 7.0% of positive specimens (15/213) in FecalSwab and 17.0% of
positive specimens (29/171) in Para-Pak C&S. Most multiple detections in FecalSwab specimens
(14/15; 93%) contained two organisms, while 6.7% (1/15) contained three organisms. In Para-
Pak C&S specimens, most multiple detections (22/29; 75.9%) contained two organisms, while
24.1% (7/29) contained three organisms. The most common multiple organism detections are
presented in Table 41 and Table 42 below.

Prospective Archived Specimen Testing:
Additional prospectively archived stool specimens were collected for Norovirus GI/GII (81
specimens) and STEC (18 specimens). Specimens were prospectively collected from four
different sites (3 US and 1 EU). All positive specimens (i.e., all-comer positives) by standard of
care testing for Norovirus (GI/GII) or STEC were archived for inclusion in the study. An
additional 20 negative specimens were included in the study for blinding purposes. Testing
included a total of 119 total specimens. Of the initial 81 specimens positive for Norovirus by
standard of care at the collection site, 77 specimens were determined to be positive for Norovirus
by the composite comparator method. Of the initial 18 specimens positive for STEC by standard
of care, 13 specimens were determined to be positive by the composite comparator method. The
remaining specimens that were not confirmed to be positive by the composite comparator were
included in the analysis as negative specimens. Results from the prospective archived specimen
testing are presented in Table 49.

1 For Norovirus GI/GII four out of the eighty-one (4/81) prospectively archived samples (positive by standard of care) were negative by the
composite comparator and therefore included as negative samples in the NPA calculations
2One (1) Para-Pak C&S sample negative by QIAstat-Dx and positive with one FDA-cleared comparator with insufficient
volume for complete composite comparator testing was classed as false negative in the PPA calculations.
3 For STEC five out of the eighteen (5/18) prospectively archived samples (positive by standard of care) were
negative by the composite comparator and therefore included as negative samples in the NPA calculations.
4 One (1) Para-Pak C&S sample positive for STEC in both QIAstat-Dx and one FDA-cleared comparator was excluded from the
PPA calculations because the samples did not have sufficient volume for complete composite comparator testing.
Retrospective Archived Study (Pre-selected specimens)
To supplement the results of the prospective clinical study, a total of 750 preselected frozen
archived retrospective specimens were evaluated. These specimens served to increase the sample
size for analytes that showed low prevalence in the prospective study or that were less
represented in a particular sample type (Para-Pak C&S or FecalSwab). Specimens were selected
based on standard of care result and were excluded from the data analysis if the comparator
methods did not confirm the preselected target as positive. Performance for the QIAstat
Gastrointestinal Panel 2 for retrospectively tested archived specimens is presented in Table 50.

Contrived Specimen Testing
Prospective and retrospective specimen testing generated low numbers of positive specimens for
at least one specimen type for Astrovirus, Rotavirus A, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Yersinia
enterocolitica, Shigella/EIEC, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora cayetanensis and Entamoeba
histolytica. To supplement the prospective and retrospective specimens test results for these
targets, an evaluation of contrived specimens was performed. Each contrived specimen was
prepared using an individual residual stool specimen matrix in Para-Pak C&S transport medium
that had previously tested negative by QIAstat-Dx Gastrointestinal Panel 2 and comparator
methods. At least, 50% of the contrived specimens were spiked at concentrations slightly above
the Limit of Detection (2x LoD) and the remainder were spiked at concentrations of 5x and 10x
LoD, using quantified strains for each pathogen. A minimum of 50 contrived specimens were
tested for each analyte evaluated. The analyte status of each contrived specimen was blinded to
the operators conducting the testing. Results are summarized in Table 53.
