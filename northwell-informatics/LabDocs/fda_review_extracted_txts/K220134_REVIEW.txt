B Measurand:
Glucose, Sodium, Methadone, and TSH
C Type of Test:
Quantitative photometric, ion selective electrode, and immunoassay
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
cobas pure integrated solutions is an automated analyzer, intended for running qualitative, semi-
quantitative and quantitative clinical chemistry and immunochemistry assays as well as ion
selective measurements.
Glucose HK Gen.3 is an in vitro test for the quantitative determination of glucose in human
serum, plasma, urine and CSF on Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems. Glucose measurements are
used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes
mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, idiopathic hypoglycemia and pancreatic islet cell tumors.
The ISE analytical unit of the Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems is intended for the quantitative
determination of sodium in serum, plasma or urine using ion‑selective electrodes. Sodium
measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism (excessive secretion of
the hormone aldosterone), diabetes insipidus (chronic excretion of large amounts of dilute urine,
accompanied by extreme thirst), adrenal hypertension, Addison's disease (caused by destruction
of the adrenal glands), dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, or other
diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.
Methadone II (MDN2) is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative and semiquantitative
detection of methadone in human urine on Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems at a cutoff
concentration of 300 ng/mL. Semiquantitative test results may be obtained that permit
laboratories to assess assay performance as part of a quality control program. Semiquantitative
assays are intended to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a
confirmatory method such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC‑MS).
Elecsys TSH is an immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of thyrotropin in
human serum and plasma. Measurements of TSH are used in the diagnosis of thyroid and

B Principle of Operation:
Glucose HK Gen. 3
Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
and magnesium ions to produce glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP).
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) specifically oxidizes G-6-P to 6-
phosphogluconate with the concurrent reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH). One micromole of NADH is produced for
each micromole of glucose consumed. The NADH produced absorbs light at 340 nm and can be
detected spectrophotometrically as an increased absorbance. The rate of NADPH formation
during the reaction is directly proportional to the glucose concentration.
ISE indirect Na for Gen. 2
The ion-selective electrode (ISE) analytical unit for Na+ employs an ion-selective membrane to
develop an electrical potential (electromotive force, EMF) for the measurements of ions in
solution. The selective membrane is in contact with both the test solution and an internal filling
solution. Due to the selectivity of the membrane, only the ions to be measured contribute to the
EMF. The membrane EMF is determined by the difference in concentration of the test ion in the
test solution and the internal filling solution. The EMF develops and ion concentration is
determined according to the Nernst equation.
ONLINE DAT Methadone II
The Methadone assay is an immunoassay based on the kinetic interaction of microparticles in a
solution (KIMS) as measured by changes in light transmission. In the absence of sample drug,
soluble drug conjugates bind to antibody-bound microparticles, causing the formation of particle
aggregates. As the aggregation reaction proceeds in the absence of sample drug, the absorbance
at 546 nm increases.
When a urine sample contains the drug in question, this drug competes with the drug derivative
conjugate for microparticle‑bound antibody. Antibody bound to sample drug is no longer
available to promote particle aggregation, and subsequent particle lattice formation is inhibited.
The presence of sample drug diminishes the increasing absorbance in proportion to the
concentration of drug in the sample. Sample drug content is determined relative to the value
obtained for a known cutoff concentration of drug.
Elecsys TSH
The Elecsys TSH immunoassay makes use of a sandwich test principle using monoclonal
antibodies specifically directed against human TSH. The antibodies labeled with ruthenium
K220134 - Page 4 of 34

--- Page 5 ---
complex consist of a chimeric construct from human and mouse specific components. In the first
incubation step, a biotinylated monoclonal TSH-specific antibody and a monoclonal
TSH-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex react to form a sandwich complex. In
the second incubation step, after addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex
becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture
is then aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured on
the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are removed by washing with ProCell II M.
Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is
measured and amplified by a photomultiplier. Results are determined via a calibration curve which
is instrument specific, generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the cobas
link.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability (within-run precision) and intermediate precision (within-laboratory precision)
were evaluated following the recommendations in the CLSI guideline EP05-A3.
Glucose HK Gen.3: Repeatability and Intermediate Precision
The precision of the Glucose HK Gen.3 assay was evaluated on one cobas pure integrated
solutions system using three lots of reagent. The protocol consisted of testing two sample
replicates per run, two runs per day for 21 days. Repeatability and within-lab precision were
calculated. The samples were randomized in each run separately. Two serum-based controls
and five levels of individual serum samples were used (Serum 1 was diluted, Serum 2 was
native, and Serum 3-5 were spiked). The protocol was repeated for each application (serum,
urine, CSF). For urine, individual samples were also used (Urine 1 was native and Urine 2-5
were spiked) while for CSF, pooled samples were used (CSF 1-2 were diluted, CSF 3 was
native, and CSF 4-5 were spiked). The results for a representative reagent lot are summarized
in the table below.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous Interference
The purpose of this study was to evaluate endogenous substances for potential interference
when using the Glucose HK Gen.3 assay, the ISE indirect Na for Gen.2 test, the ONLINE
DAT Methadone II test and the Elecsys TSH assay on the cobas pure integrated solutions
system.
Glucose HK Gen. 3
The effect on the quantitation of the analyte in the presence of potentially interfering
endogenous substances using the Glucose HK Gen.3 assay was determined on the cobas pure
integrated solutions system using serum, urine, and CSF samples. Glucose levels of
approximately 40 mg/dL and 220 mg/dL were tested. Significant interference was defined as
follows:
• Serum/Plasma: bias between the samples with and without interferent is > ± 7 mg/dL at
glucose concentrations ≤ 70 mg/dL and > ± 10% at glucose concentrations > 70 mg/dL
• Urine: bias between the samples with and without interferent is > ± 2 mg/dL at glucose
concentrations ≤ 19.8 mg/dL and > ± 10% at glucose concentrations > 19.8 mg/dL
• CSF: bias between the samples with and without interferent is > ± 4 mg/dL at glucose
concentrations ≤ 39.6 mg/dL and > ± 10% at glucose concentrations > 39.6 mg/dL

ONLINE DAT Methadone II Cross Reactivity
The specificity of the ONLINE DAT Methadone II assay for structurally similar compounds
was determined by preparing concentration series for each of the compounds listed, using
measured signals of the different potential cross reactant concentration to determine the
approximate quantity of each compound that is equivalent in assay reactivity to the 300
ng/mL assay cutoff. The percent cross-reactivity was calculated from the ratio of methadone
concentration at cutoff level and the calculated cross reactant concentration, that yields the
same signal.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
Assays reportable ranges are described in the linearity section (VII.A.2 above).
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
Traceability information for the Glucose HK Gen.3 assay, the ISE indirect Na for Gen.2 test
and the Elecsys TSH assay was provided in K191899 and is unchanged.
ONLINE DAT Methadone II assay is traceable to a primary reference method (GC‑MS).
On-board Reagent Stability
Glucose HK Gen. 3
A reagent stability study confirmed that the Glucose HK Gen.3 reagent is stable for 26 weeks
on-board the cobas pure integrated solutions system.
ONLINE DAT Methadone II
A reagent stability study confirmed that the ONLINE DAT Methadone II reagent is stable for
26 weeks on-board the cobas pure integrated solutions system.
Elecsys TSH
A reagent stability study confirmed that the Elecsys TSH reagent is stable for 16 weeks on-
board the cobas pure integrated solutions system.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
determined in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
The LoB was determined as the 95th percentile of measurements of blank samples. For
determination of the LoB for the Glucose HK Gen. 3 assay and the ISE indirect Na for Gen.
2 test, one analyte-free sample was measured with three reagent lots in six runs, distributed
over three days, 10 replicates per run, on one cobas pure integrated solutions system. For
determination of LoB for the Elecsys TSH assay, five blank samples were measured with
three reagent lots in six runs, distributed over three days, two replicates per run, on one cobas
pure integrated solutions system. In total, 60 determinations of analyte free samples were
obtained. Data analysis was based on determination of the 95th percentile of the 60 measured
values. In this design (n=60) the 95th percentile was the average of the 57th and 58th value.
The LoD was determined as the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected
with a 95% probability. For determination of the LoD for the Glucose HK Gen.3 assay, the
ISE indirect Na for Gen.2 test and the Elecsys TSH assay, five samples with low analyte
content were measured using three reagent lots with two-fold determination per run on one
cobas pure integrated solutions system. Six runs distributed over ≥ three days on one
instrument were performed. The LoD is defined as the concentration, at which there is a 95%
probability that a sample contains analyte. LoD = LoB + 1.653 x SD .
total
K220134 - Page 27 of 34

--- Page 28 ---
The LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration of analyte which can be quantified with
a maximum CV of 20% for the Glucose HK Gen.3 assay and the Elecsys TSH assay and a
maximum total error (TE) of 30% for the ISE indirect Na for Gen.2 test. For determination of
the LoQ for the Glucose HK Gen. 3 assay, the ISE indirect Na for Gen.2 test and the Elecsys
TSH assay, five samples with low analyte concentration were measured using three reagent
lots on one cobas pure integrated solutions system. For the Glucose HK Gen.3 assay and the
Elecsys TSH assay, these samples were tested in one run per day over five days, five
replicates per run for each LoQ sample (n=25 per sample). For the ISE indirect Na for Gen.2
test, these samples were tested in two runs per day over three days, two replicates per run for
each LoQ sample (n=12 per sample).
The results support the claimed LoB, LoD and LoQ for the Glucose HK Gen.3 assay, the ISE
indirect Na for Gen.2 test and the Elecsys TSH assay which are unchanged from the
predicate device (K191899) and are summarized in the table below.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Glucose HK Gen. 3
Method comparison studies were performed for serum, urine and CSF using the Glucose HK
Gen.3 assay on the cobas pure integrated solutions system and the Glucose HK Gen.3 assay
on the cobas pro integrated solutions system (predicate) to assess the differences between the
two test systems. Native human samples were tested in singlicate on each test system. Less
than 10% of these samples were spiked or diluted to cover the measuring range. The results
were analyzed using Passing-Bablok and linear regression analyses. The process was
repeated for each application (serum, urine, CSF). A summary of results is presented in the
table below.

Elecsys TSH
A method comparison study was performed using the Elecsys TSH assay on the cobas pure
integrated solutions system and the Elecsys TSH assay on the cobas pro integrated solutions
system (predicate) to assess the differences between the two test systems. A total of 147
samples (132 native human serum samples, single donors as well as pools and 15 native
human serum samples diluted with Diluent Multiassay) were measured in singlicate on each
test system. The results were evaluated using Passing-Bablok and linear regression analyses.
A summary of results is presented in the table below.

Glucose HK Gen. 3
To support the use of the Glucose HK Gen.3 assay on the cobas pure integrated solutions
system with different sample matrices, a matrix comparison study was conducted by
comparing values obtained from samples drawn into serum and plasma collection tubes.
Some samples were spiked to cover the measuring range. The result of the serum sample was
compared with the result of each plasma sample from the same donor. At least 30
serum/plasma pairs were tested for each type of anticoagulant in one run, in singlicate. The
results were evaluated using Passing-Bablok regression analysis. A summary of results is
presented in the table below.

ISE indirect Na for Gen.2
To support the use of the ISE indirect Na for Gen.2 test on the cobas pure integrated
solutions system with other sample matrices, a matrix comparison study was conducted by
testing matched Li-heparin plasma and serum samples from the same patients on one cobas
pure integrated solutions system. The samples were tested in singlicate. The results were
evaluated using Passing-Bablok regression analysis. A summary of results is presented in the

Elecsys TSH
To support the use of the Elecsys TSH assay on the cobas pure integrated solutions system
with other sample matrices, a matrix comparison study was conducted by comparing values
obtained from samples (native human serum samples) drawn into serum, Li-heparin,
K EDTA and K EDTA plasma tubes. At least 50 serum/plasma pairs per anticoagulant type

In addition, a plasma separation tubes (PST) and serum separation tubes (SST) comparison
study was conducted, using separation tubes from three separate manufacturers and blood
from at least seven donors. Measurements were performed in duplicate using one reagent lot
on one cobas pure integrated solutions system and evaluated based on recovery relative to the
serum/plasma tube without separating gel (reference).
The results of these studies support the method sheet claim that the following sample types
are acceptable to use for Elecsys TSH assay: serum collected using standard serum tubes or
tubes containing separating gel, Li-heparin, K EDTA, K EDTA plasma and plasma tubes

containing separating gel.
