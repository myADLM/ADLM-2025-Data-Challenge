IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
HER2/ER/PR IHControls® - Level H, HER2/ER/PR IHControls® - Level M and HER2/ER/PR
IHControls® - Level L (HER2/ER/PR IHControls®) are unassayed positive controls for HER2,
ER, and PR IHC assays which are provided in vials as a liquid suspension. The suspension
contains microscopic glass microbeads that are approximately the same size as cells and coated
with purified analyte(s). HER2/ER/PR IHControls® are not biological cells or tissues. The
microbead surface bears the molecule(s) being measured. Peptides representing the epitopes of
HER2, ER, and PR antibodies used by clinical IHC laboratories are incorporated into the
products. The same immunohistochemical reaction that occurs on a tissue or cellular sample also
occurs on the HER2/ER/PR IHControls®. As a result of immunostaining, the HER2/ER/PR
IHControls® bearing the analyte turn the same color as cells expressing the analyte. The
HER2/ER/PR panel includes controls at 3 different analyte concentrations, which allows
matching the analyte concentration to the dynamic range (range of staining intensity) of the
particular HER2, ER, or PR IHC stain with which it is intended to be used.
Figure 1. The 3 levels of HER2/ER/PR IHControls® and their microbeads are schematically
illustrated. Each circle represents a test microbead, coated with one or more peptide analytes.
The primary antibodies immunoreactive with the peptide coatings are listed within the circles.
Level H has 4 different test microbeads, each coated with a single peptide. Levels M and L have
only two different test microbeads, coated with a cocktail of HER2/ER/PR peptides, although the
concentration is lower in Level L.
The 3 different analyte concentrations of the HER2/ER/PR IHControls® panel are provided to
allow the user to select a control with the lowest analyte concentration that still produces an
easily visible immunostain. The analyte concentrations are as follows:
K220163 - Page 3 of 16

--- Page 4 ---
Level H (high): Includes analytes for HER2, ER, and PR, at approximately 106 molecules per
microbead. It consists of 4 different microbeads, each coated with a single different (HER2, ER
or PR) peptide.
Level M (medium): Includes analytes for HER2, ER, and PR, at approximately 105 molecules
per microbead. It consists of 2 different types of microbeads in equal numbers, one coated with
HER2/ER/PR peptides and the other coated with antigenically irrelevant peptide
Level L (low): Includes analytes for HER2, ER, and PR, at approximately 104 molecules per
microbead. It consists of two different types of microbeads in equal numbers, one coated with
HER2/ER/PR peptides and the other coated with antigenically irrelevant peptide.
These concentrations are approximate; they are not intended as assayed controls.
The configuration of the different levels (high, medium, low) of the device also provides for an
internal negative control for each product. For level H, the negative control microbeads comprise
those with other HER2/ER/PR analytes. For levels M and L, the negative control microbead
bears a peptide that is unrelated to HER2/ER/PR. This arrangement also means that for any
single IHC stain, 25% of the microbeads will turn positive for Level H and 50% for Levels M
and L.
HER2/ER/PR IHControls® are intended to be placed on the same slide as the patient tissue. The
precise location of the HER2/ER/PR IHControls® on each individual slide depends on where the
tissue section is and where there is space on the slide. Figure 2 below shows the acceptable
positioning of the HER2/ER/PR IHControls® on the slide that has patient tissue.

B Principle of Operation:
The HER2/ER/PR IHControls® contains analytes that bind IHC stains. They are on-slide controls
and therefore negative staining due to analytic error is readily detectable for each individual
slide. Like tissue samples, the HER2/ER/PR IHControls® are formalin fixed during manufacture.
Therefore, test microbeads in the HER2/ER/PR IHControls® product may demonstrate improved
immunoreactivity after antigen retrieval.
Users pipette a droplet of HER2/ER/PR IHControls® onto a microscope slide that also bears a
patient’s tissue sample. The droplet hardens upon drying, adheres the analyte-coated microbeads
to the microscope slide, and is then processed with the patient sample. The hardened droplet is
able to pass through dry heat associated with “baking” of slides, organic solvents associated with
deparaffinization, boiling associated with antigen retrieval, and repeated rinses associated with
immunostaining. After staining steps, the slide containing both the patient sample and the
HER2/ER/PR IHControls®, can be observed by a standard brightfield microscope. Microscopic
examination is performed with approximately 400X magnification using Köhler illumination
optics, modified by opening the condenser aperture to the maximum.
Interpretation: Approximately one-quarter to one-half of the microbeads on the slide will be
stained with the appropriate single HER2, ER or PR IHC stain. Test microbeads with the
different analyte remain unstained. Fields with the highest microbead stain intensity without
significant background staining of the matrix are chosen for interpretation. Expected stain
intensity (baseline) must be initially determined by manual microscope review of the slide
containing the HER2/ER/PR IHControls® microbead before placing this product into routine use.
This baseline stain intensity may be different for each laboratory depending on the IHC device
being used. HER2/ER/PR IHControls® are interpreted by manual microscopic review by
comparing their stain intensity to the established baseline slide. Stain intensity for the
HER2/ER/PR IHControls® should be similar from day-to-day. If an HER2/ER/PR IHControls
stain intensity is visibly lower than the baseline, then that indicates failure of the HER2/ER/PR

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a) Lot to Lot Reproducibility:
Three independent lots of each level (H, M and L) of HER2/ER/PR IHControls® were
used in this study. The reproducibility of the products was evaluated by physical
(concentration, pH) as well as functional (stain intensity, microbead retention) criteria.
Peptide analyte concentration: The peptides that represent the analytes have a single
fluorescein attached at a location away from the primary antibody epitope. The
attachment of the peptide(s) to the microbead was verified by measuring fluorescence
intensity. Coefficients of variation (CVs) among three lots were as follows: Level H
product – CV ranged from 2.7% - 6.8%, Level M – 9.5% and Level L- 4.5. All of the
product lots also met the required minimum threshold concentration criteria that was
developed to target the three distinct levels for peptide analyte concentration.

Stain intensity: This was a functional test to verify that the microbead was
immunoreactive to at least a minimal threshold level of stain intensity. Stain intensity was
measured after depositing a 1 microliter droplet of product onto a microscope slide,
which was then processed with the appropriate IHC stain. Table 3 shows that the CVs
among three lots of each of the three assembled products ranged from 6.5% - 22%,
depending on the analyte being stained. This variability factors in the peptide analyte
reproducibility coupled with the variability associated with IHC assays. It meets the
minimum stain intensity requirements for each product lot.

represented the baseline for 100% retention. The percent retention was calculated as the
number of microbeads on the antigen retrieval slides divided by the number of
microbeads on the slides that were untreated. The minimum passing threshold for
acceptability was 80%. Retention rates were consistently found to be >90%.
b) Reader Reproducibility:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pathologist’s ability to reproducibly
interpret HER2/ER/PR IHControls®. Thirty slides (10 slides each for HER2, ER, and PR)
containing the HER2/ER/PR IHControls® beads were evaluated in this study. In each set
of ten, 4 were stained with a diluted primary antibody (2 slides with weak stain) or no
primary antibody (2 slides with no stain) to simulate an IHC staining problem. Slides
stained sub-optimally were included in this study to avoid bias. All 3 product levels, H,
M, and L were tested.
Three pathologists were provided with an HER2/ER/PR IHControls® slide set that
included slides demonstrating the expected stain intensity associated with normal
staining. Each pathologist evaluated 10 HER2, 10 ER, and 10 PR HER2/ER/PR
IHControls® slides in a blinded manner and assessed stain intensity. The pathologists
evaluated the slides and scored them as Pass (staining is as expected) or Fail (suboptimal
staining due to diluted primary antibody). The pathologists’ answers were then compared,
to determine if pathologists were able to identify decrements in stain intensity.
There was 100% agreement with the expected results for both the Pass and Fail
parameters for all 3 pathologists.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
This study evaluated HER2/ER/PR IHControls® immunoreactivity to a panel of 26
antigenically irrelevant antibodies that are commonly used in clinical immunohistochemistry
laboratories. HER2/ER/PR IHControls® were pipetted onto slides in duplicate, and a positive
tissue control was included on every slide to verify test performance. The slides were stained
with the primary antibodies listed in the Table 4 below and reviewed. All 3 product levels, H,
M, and L were tested.
Staining for HER2/ER/PR IHControls® and tissue control were expressed as “positive” or
“negative” as in Table 4 below.

Results: None of the HER2/ER/PR IHControls® stained with any of the 26 antigenically
irrelevant antibodies. All tissue positive controls stained, demonstrating that the IHC assay
itself worked appropriately. The HER2/ER/PR IHControls® slides showed appropriate
positive and negative staining.

5. Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The stability study tested the immunoreactivity of 3 different lots of the HER2/ER/PR panel
of HER2/ER/PR IHControls® in the final product container under refrigerated conditions (2-
8oC).
For each IHControls®, three vials from each of three different lots were stored at 2 – 8oC, for
a total of nine vials. At each time point, all the vials were removed from the refrigerator and
opened. One vial of each set was used until it was depleted, followed by the second vial, then

the third. One microliter of the HER2/ER/PR IHControls® was pipetted onto duplicate slides
and tested by IHC staining.
Each slide consisted of nine one microliter spots: three rows of three spots. Each row
contained one spot for each of the HER2/ER/PR IHControls® lots. The HER2/ER/PR
IHControls®-spotted slides were stained with various HER2, ER, or PR immunostains.
Failure is defined when stain intensity is below moderate intensity, for two sequential
evaluations. The failure time point is the first of these two. For visual examination, the data
are expressed as Pass (P) or Fail (F). Based on the data, the shelf-life of HER2/ER/PR
IHControls® was determined to be at 392 days when stored at 2 – 8ºC.

a. The performance of the HER2/ER/PR IHControls® as a positive on-slide control was
evaluated in 3 clinical sites (immunohistochemistry laboratories). HER2/ER/PR
IHControls® was placed on the same slides as patient samples, as per device instructions
for use. Also, the laboratory’s own tissue controls that are normally used to evaluate the
quality of their stains were placed on the same slides. The HER2/ER/PR IHControls®
were used for HER2, ER, and PR testing for 37 to 42 days over a period of two months at
each site for a total of 442 samples. The pathologist at each site evaluated stain
performance using the HER2/ER/PR IHControls® at the same time that the tissue
controls were evaluated. Slide review results were recorded as pass or fail, both for the
laboratory’s existing (comparator) controls as well as for the HER2/ER/PR IHControls®.

The overall concordance rate was 440 out of 442 tests, or 99.5%, from all 3 clinical trial
sites, for ER, PR, and HER2 tests combined. Individual site concordance was 100%,
99.5%, and 99.1%. The two discrepancies between HER2/ER/PR IHControls® and the
comparator tissue controls were due to operator error: (1) placement of the HER2/ER/PR
IHControls® at the slide edge because the patient sample and tissue (comparator) control
left no other place, and (2) use of an incorrect HER2/ER/PR IHControls®. In addition, at
one of the sites the histotechnologist did not pipette the HER2/ER/PR IHControls® onto
the slides on 2 separate days. Therefore, data points from the two days (that included a
total of 10 slides) were not included in the analysis.

*Slides from two days, ten (10) slides in total, were deemed uninformative because HER2/ER/PR
IHControls® were not applied to the slides and therefore not included in the data analysis
b. An additional study was conducted to demonstrate that HER2/ER/PR IHControls® are
comparable to staining failures in conventional tissue controls, under simulated failure
(lower levels of primary antibody) conditions.
The study compared the sensitivity of HER2/ER/PR IHControls® and tissue controls in
detecting simulated assay failure. Microscope slides bearing both HER2/ER/PR
IHControls® and tissue controls were stained as per protocol or after diluting the primary
antibody. The HER2/ER/PR IHControls® and tissue controls were then evaluated
visually, by 4 pathologists to objectively and quantitatively assess stain intensity.
Pass/fail scores were assigned to each slide. A “pass” meant that quality control revealed
a normally functioning IHC assay; the stain intensity was not noticeably different than
that associated with assay normal mode. A “fail” meant that the quality control reveals
the presence of an IHC assay problem showing noticeable lowered stain intensity than
baseline. In 48 readouts, both tissue controls and HER2/ER/PR IHControls® provide
concordant measures of IHC assay performance. There was 100% agreement in
identifying assay failures between HER2/ER/PR IHControls® and tissue controls based
on the staining in HER2/ER/PR IHControls® and tissue control slides.
