IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys AFP reagent rackpack (M, R1, R2) consists of:
M: Streptavidin-coated microparticles (transparent cap), one bottle, 12 mL: Streptavidin-
coated microparticles 0.72 mg/mL; preservative.
R1: Anti-AFP-Ab~biotin (gray cap), one bottle, 17 mL: Biotinylated monoclonal anti-
AFP antibodies (mouse) 4.5 mg/L; phosphate buffer 100 mmol/L, pH 6.0;
preservative.
R2: Anti-AFP-Ab~Ru(bpy) (black cap), one bottle, 17 mL: Monoclonal anti-AFP
antibodies (mouse) labeled with ruthenium complex 12.0 mg/L; phosphate buffer 100
mmol/L, pH 6.0; preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
The Elecsys AFP is a one-step sandwich immunoassay. AFP present in the patient sample,
ruthenium-labeled AFP specific antibody, and biotin-labeled AFP specific antibody to form a
sandwich complex. The complexes are immobilized onto the surface of magnetic microparticles
via biotin-streptavidin binding. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where
K220176 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound
substances are then removed with ProCell/ProCell M. Current is applied to the electrode to
stimulate chemiluminescent emission that is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are
determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2-
point calibration and a master curve provided with the reagent bar code; the measured
electrochemiluminescence signal is proportional to the amount of AFP in the sample.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the Elecsys AFP was evaluated using one human serum sample with high
analyte content above the measuring range that was diluted to the lower end of the measuring
range with human serum sample without AFP for a total of 15 concentration levels across the
measuring range. Samples were assayed in triplicate within a single run on one cobas e 601
analyzer using one reagent lot. The linear regression analysis was performed and the results
of the study were as follows:
Y-Intercept (95% CI)
Slope (95% CI) R2
(IU/mL)
0.965 (0.909; 1.021) 0.433 (0.397; 0.462) 0.958
The results support the claimed measuring range 1.5 – 1000.0 IU/mL.
High Dose Hook Effect:
Two extremely high AFP serum samples were serially diluted to determine the hook effect.
The results indicated that there was no hook effect up to 1,000,000 IU/mL.

Dilution of over-range samples:
A dilution study was performed to compare cobas e 601 analyzers’ ability to correctly dilute
and then measure very high analyte samples. Four samples with very high native
concentration samples were diluted in Diluent Universal at 1:50 manually and by automated
dilution using two cobas e 601 analyzers. The diluted samples were tested in triplicate and
the recovery of instrument vs manual was calculated. The percent recovery for all four
samples was within 91 – 106%, supporting the recommended 1:50 dilution in the instructions
for use for the Elecsys AFP.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous Interference:
Potential interference from some endogenous substances was assessed using three serum
samples with AFP concentrations of low-range (~3 IU/mL), mid-range (~420 IU/mL), and
high-range (~700 IU/mL). Each of the three samples was further divided into two aliquots for
a control sample (with no added interferent) and test sample (with added interferent) then
combined in different ratios into a series of 11 samples of varying substance concentration by
inter-mixing the control and test samples with known volumes. Each sample of the dilution
series was assayed in five replicates using one lot and one instrument. From measurement of
the dilution series, the highest interferent concentration within the allowable error was found
and identified as the highest concentration at which no significant interference is observed.
For each interferent concentration level, the recovery (absolute difference or % recovery)
was calculated by comparing the mean of the replicates of each sample containing
interference to the control. No significant interference (an absolute difference of < 0.4
IU/mL for samples between 1.5 to 4 IU/mL and a recovery of 100% ± 10% for samples > 4.0
IU/mL) was observed for the samples containing each interference substance at the
concentrations shown in the table below:
Highest concentration tested
Endogenous Interferent
without interference
Albumin 7 g/dL
Bilirubin 6 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 2200 mg/dL
Intralipid 1500 mg/dL
IgG 7 g/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 1500 IU/mL
Biotin Interference:
One aliquot of each AFP sample was spiked with biotin up to 3600 ng/mL and used as
“interference pool”. A series of 11 dilution steps were prepared by mixing the interference
pools and the related dilution pools in 10% increments. Each sample of the dilution series

was assayed in five replicates using one reagent lot on one cobas e 601 analyzer. Recovery
(absolute deviation or % recovery) was calculated based on the mean of the replicates
compared to the expected value. For all samples with biotin concentrations ≤ 2400 ng/mL,
an absolute deviation of < 0.4 IU/mL was observed for samples with AFP concentration
between 1.5 to 4 IU/mL, and a recovery of 100% ± 10% was observed for samples with AFP
concentration > 4.0 IU/mL. The results support that the device has no significant biotin
interference up to 1200 ng/mL.
Exogenous Interference:
Interference from 17 common pharmaceutical drugs (e.g., antibiotics), 10 pharmaceutical
drugs that might be used in the clinical context of the assay’s intended use were assessed
using two serum pools, one with a low concentration of AFP (~3.1 IU/mL) and one with a
high concentration of AFP (~700 IU/mL) samples. The two samples were divided into
aliquots and spiked with the potential interferents or with solvent only. No significant
interference (an absolute difference of < 0.4 IU/mL for samples between 1.5 to 4 IU/mL and
a recovery of 100% ± 10% for samples > 4.0 IU/mL) was observed for the samples
containing each interference substance at the concentrations shown in the table below:

Traceability:
The assay is traceable to the 1st IRP WHO Reference Standard 72/225.
Stability:
An on-board stability study of the modified assay reagents was performed using six samples
across the measuring range to verify the claim established in K981282. The data supported
the package insert claim of 4 weeks on-board stability.
A real-time study was conducted using six samples across the measuring range and tested at
various time points after storage at 2–8 °C to verify a shelf-life stability of 21 months.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.
Limit of Blank (LoB):
For determination of LoB, five analyte-free serum samples were measured in duplicate in six
runs, distributed over six days, with three different reagent lots on one cobas e 601 analyzer.
In total, 60 measured values of analyte free samples were obtained per lot. The LoB
corresponds to the concentration below which analyte‑free samples are found with a
probability of 95%. The LoB determined in all three lots were less than the LoB claim in the
labeling, 0.75 IU/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
For determination of LoD, five low-level native human samples were measured in duplicate
in six runs, distributed over six days, with three different lots on one cobas e 601 analyzer. In
total, 60 measured values of samples with low analyte concentrations were obtained per lot.
The LoD corresponds to the concentration determined by LoD = LoB + 1.653 x SD total (of
low analyte samples). The LoD determined in all three lots were less than the LoD claim in
the labeling, 1.5 IU/mL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ):
For the determination of LoQ, six low-level native human samples were measured five-fold
in one run a day for five days, with three different lots on one cobas e 601 analyzer. The LoQ
was set as the lowest concentration of analyte that can be reproducibly measured with a total
error of ≤ 20 %. The LoQ determined in all three lots support the claim of LoQ equal to LoD
in the labeling, 1.5 IU/mL.

on the cobas e 601 analyzer with sample matrices: lithium (Li) heparin plasma, dipotassium
(K2) EDTA plasma, and tripotassium (K3) EDTA plasma. In the study, at least 48 donor
matched venous specimens were collected. Each specimen was tested in singlicate. The
results were analyzed by Passing-Bablok linear regression with serum results as the reference
(x-axis). The slope and intercept of the regression line were calculated, and summarized as
