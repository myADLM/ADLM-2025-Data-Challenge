The Total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) reagent kit is provided in a two-part ready-to-use liquid
format designed for optimal performance on Beckman Coulter AU/DxC AU clinical chemistry
analyzers.
Each IgE reagent kit contains the following:
• One (1) IgE R1 bottle that contains reaction buffer (41.5 mL).
• One (1) IgE R2 bottle that contains particle-bound mouse anti-IgE antibody (15.5 mL).
• One six-level IgE calibrator set (2 mL for each calibrator level; Level 1 – Level 6) to
establish a multi-point calibration curve. The calibrators are matched to the IgE reagent lot
and should not be interchanged.
• One (1) Value Assignment Sheet

calibration and each new lot of IgE reagent. Quality control materials can be purchased from
Beckman Coulter or alternative suppliers.
B Principle of Operation:
The IgE assay is a fully automated assay that measures total IgE concentration in human serum
and plasma by a turbidimetric immunoassay method. When a sample is mixed with R1 buffer
and R2 antiserum solution, human IgE reacts specifically with anti-IgE antibody-coated particles
to yield insoluble aggregates. Immune complexes formed in solution scatter light in proportion to
their size, shape and concentration. Turbidimeters measure the reduction of incident light due to
reflection, absorption or scatter. The decrease in intensity of light transmitted (increase in
absorbance) through particles suspended in solution is as a result of complexes formed. The
change in absorbance is measured at 800 nanometers and used by the system to calculate and
express the IgE concentration (in IU/mL) based on the stored calibration curve.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the Total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) assay was evaluated in accordance with the
CLSI guideline EP06-A. A pool of human sera containing IgE concentration greater than the
upper assay range limit (576 IU/mL) was combined with a pool of low IgE human sera (13
IU/mL) to create a 15-level dilution series spanning across the assay measuring range. Each
dilution was tested in quadruplicate and in random order. The modelled non-linearity was not
statistically significant and the assay was deemed linear. The observed values were graphed
against the calculated values and a weighted linear regression was performed. The assay is
linear from 13.2–575.5 IU/mL. The claimed linear assay range is from 20−500 IU/mL and
the linear equation is y= 1.01x + 0.63 and R2=0.99.
Automatic Dilution:
Samples exceeding the upper limit of linearity in the IgE concentration range 500–1000
IU/mL should be diluted with deionized water and repeated. The result is multiplied by the
dilution factor automatically utilizing the AUTO REPEAT RUN. A study was performed to
verify the automatic dilution settings on the DxC 700 AU Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. The
accuracy and repeatability of automatic sample pre-dilution was assessed by comparing
manual dilution with the instrument’s 1:10 auto dilution function. To assess accuracy, three
samples were prepared by diluting an aliquot of the World Health Organization (WHO)
standard 11/234 with deionized water to achieve to achieve analyte levels spanning the
claimed IgE extended measuring interval (EMI) of > 500 to 1,000 IU/mL. Test samples were
assayed by auto-dilution in triplicate. For the repeatability assessment, portions of a single
patient donor pool were spiked to three different analyte levels within the claimed IgE EMI.
Twenty replicates of the neat test samples were programmed so that the instrument would
perform the auto-dilution and re-run routine 20 times. For the manual dilution tests, the 20

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
i. Endogenous Interference:
Interference studies were peformed in accordance with the CLSI guidelines EP07 and
EP37. For the endogenous interference studies, five levels of each interferent were
evaluated at three IgE levels spanning the measuring range, including an IgE
concentration near the upper reference interval limit to represent a medical decision level
(MDL). Test samples were prepared from a human serum pool of known IgE
concentration that was diluted to achieve the desired total IgE levels using Ig-depleted
human serum. Each test sample was spiked with known quantities of potentially
interfering substances and analyzed in five replicates, in one assay run, with a single lot
of the IgE reagent and a single DxC 700 AU analyzer. The recovery was calculated by
comparing to control samples spiked with the same volume of diluents. The sponsor
defines significant interference as ±10.0 IU/mL for recovered values ≤100 IU/mL and
±10% for values >100 IU/mL. No significant interference was demonstrated with the
following substances up to the levels indicated: hemoglobin (1g/dL), unconjugated
bilirubin (60 mg/dL), Intralipid (1 g/dL), and rheumatoid factor (250 IU/mL). Human
anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) was not evaluated in the study. A limitation statement was
added to the package insert stating that patients who have received preparations of mouse
monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy may contain HAMA and may show either
falsely elevated or depressed values when tested.
ii. Exogenous Interference:
The potential interference of 21 commonly used drugs, including those used for allergy
treatment, was evaluated by testing each potential drug interferent at approximately three
times the peak therapeutic concentrations and comparing the observed difference to the
allowable bias specification. Test samples were prepared from pooled patient serum
adjusted with human IgE or IgE-depleted serum to achieve a total IgE concentration of
165 IU/mL. To ensure that the test sample matrices were diluted as little as possible,
interferent stock solutions were prepared in the appropriate solvents to achieve drug
concentrations at least 20 times the maximum dose. Paired test and control samples were
assayed in five replicates, each using a single lot of the IgE reagent and a single DxC 700
AU analyzer, and mean values were used to evaluate the observed bias. No significant
interference was demonstrated with the common drugs at the indicated test
concentrations listed in the table below. The drug omalizumab (Xolair), a synthetic anti-

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay reportable range is 20 – 500 IU/mL. Samples exceeding the upper limit of
linearity in the IgE concentration range 500– 1000 IU/mL should be diluted with deionized
water and repeated. The result is multiplied by the dilution factor automatically utilizing the
AUTO REPEAT RUN.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
i) Traceability and value assignment:
The Total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) calibrators are prepared from stabilized normal
human plasma spiked with purified human IgE. Through the value assignment process,
the human IgE in the calibrators is traceable to the WHO 3rd International Reference
Preparation for human serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE), 11/234.
ii) Kit stability:
Closed kit stability ̶ A real-time stability study was performed in accordance with the
CLSI guideline EP25 using three lots of IgE reagent with paired IgE calibrators on a
single DxC 700 AU analyzer to evaluate assay performance for reagent kits stored under
normal conditions (2–8°C). As a worst-case scenario, one of these test lots was pre-
stressed to environmental test conditions that simulated potential winter and summer
transport profiles and compared to the performance of unstressed (control) product
through the duration of the stability period. Testing was performed with three levels of
human serum-based control materials at multiple time points throughout the claimed
stability period and at least one month past the expiration date. Results support the 24-
month shelf-lfe stability claim for the Total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) reagent kit.
In-use reagent stability ̶ A real-time stability study was performed to support the in-use
stability claims for the IgE kit components and the IgE assay calibration interval. For the
reagent in-use study, opened IgE reagents (R1 and R2) were stored on-board the analyzer
in the reagent storage compartment (2–8ºC), and a new set of IgE calibrators was opened
and used for each calibration event. For the calibrator in-use study, the reagent was
removed from the analyzer after use on each test day (capped and stored in the
refrigerator at 2–8ºC), and one set of calibrators was opened on Day 0, used throughout
the study period, and stored at 2–8ºC. The mean recovery at each time point was used to
calculate the bias versus the Day 0 mean recovery. Results supports the stability of (i) the
IgE reagents (R1 and R2) after first opening for 28 days at 2 ̶ 8ºC, (ii) the calibrator bottle
after first opening for 45 days at 2 ̶ 8ºC and (iii) the calibration interval of 14 days.
iii) Sample stability and storage:
Sample stability studies were initiated on the day of specimen collection using one lot of
candidate IgE reagent on a single DxC 700 AU analyzer. Three patient pools with total
IgE levels spanning the claimed assay range were aliquoted and stored under each
temperature condition. Two test runs were performed with fresh samples to establish a
K220178 - Page 8 of 12

time-zero (T ) mean recovery value for all temperatures. Aliquots of the serum and
0
plasma samples were assayed in quadruplicate at each time point of each storage
temperature. The final time point exceeded the claimed in-use duration claim by at least
one day. Results for each sample type and temperature condition support the sample
stability claims summarized in the table below.

6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
studies were conducted in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A2 using the Classical
Approach. The studies evaluated two lots of IgE reagents on one DxC 700 AU analyzer.
The LoB was determined with four different immunoglobulin (Ig)-depleted human serum
samples used as the individual blank samples. Each blank sample was tested in five replicates
per sample, one run per day for three days to obtain a total of 60 replicates. The LoB was
estimated as the 95th percentile of the measurements for each of the lots tested and
determined to be 5.9 IU/mL and 7.5 IU/mL for the two IgE reagent lots. The LoB claim that
corresponds to the highest observed values between the two IgE reagent lots is 7.5 IU/mL.
The LoD and LoQ were determined using four native patient pools diluted with Ig-depleted
serum to achieve the low analyte levels. The target analyte concentration was approximately
14 IU/mL for the LoD test samples and approximately 19 IU/mL for the LoQ test samples.
Each LoD sample was tested in five replicates per sample, one run per day for three days to
obtain a total of 60 replicates. The LoD was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of the
replicates for the low-level samples and determined as 13.8 IU/mL and 12.5 IU/mL for the
two IgE reagent lots. The LoD claim that corresponds to the highest observed values between
the two IgE reagent lots is 13.8 IU/mL.
Each LoQ sample was tested in three replicates per sample, one run per day for three days to
obtain a total of 36 replicates. The LoQ, defined as the mean IgE value of the sample which
fulfills the specification of 20 IU/mL that corresponds to the IgE concentration that can be
quantitatively determined with ≤ 35% CV, was estimated as 19.6 IU/mL with 11.9% CV and
17.8 IU/mL with 7.8% CV for the two lots of reagents. The LoQ claim that corresponds to
the highest observed values between the two IgE reagent lots is 19.6 IU/mL which is the
lower limit of the measuring range claimed for the assay.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparions study was performed in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP09c.
The study evaluated 136 fresh neat serum samples spanning the analytical measuring range
of the Total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) assay. Each sample was assayed using a single lot of
candidate IgE reagent and a single lot of calibrator on a single DxC 700 AU analyzer with
one test replicate per sample cup and two sample cups per test run. The second cup served
only as a backup in the event of a sampling error with the first replicate. Quality control
materials were included to qualify each test run. Results based on Weighted Deming
regression analysis are summarized in table below.

2. Matrix Comparison:
To demonstrate that sodium (Na)-Heparin, lithium (Li)-Heparin, K -EDTA and K -EDTA
2 3
plasma samples yield results comparable with serum samples tested by the Total
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) assay, a study was performed by using freshly drawn matched
samples from apparently healthy adult volunteer donors, where five specimen tubes were
drawn from each donor: one serum tube and one tube of each type of anticoagulant. Four
(~7%) of the 57 donor sets were spiked with purified human IgE to ensure adequate test
sample distribution across the claimed measuring range. Paired samples were run in
duplicates with one IgE reagent lot on a single DxC 700 AU analyzer and analyzed using
only the first replicate result. Two of the 57 donor sets recovered outside of the IgE analytical
range for all sample types and were removed from the final data set. The Weighted Deming
regression analysis was performed, and the results are summarized in the following table:

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A reference interval study was performed in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP28-A3c
using two sets of serum samples collected from an adult non-atopic donor population (N=169).
The first set of 119 serum samples were collected from a population of apparently healthy, non-
atopic, male and female adults (> 18 years of age) in Carlsbad, California. Another set of 50
serum samples was obtained from donor volunteers (adult, non-atopic) in Chaska, Minnesota.
All test samples were from individuals that stated no known allergies and listed no allergy
medications on the Donor Information form. Testing was performed using a single lot of IgE
reagent on a DxC 700 AU analyzer, one test replicate per sample. Three levels of control
material were included to qualify each test run. The reference interval was determined by a non-
parametric method based on the central 95% of the data distribution, using 90% confidence

intervals for the upper and lower limits (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles, respectively). Results
established a total IgE reference interval of 2.6 to 699.9 IU/mL for a non-atopic, asymptomatic
adult population.
IgE reference intervals are significantly influenced by age, sex, geographic location, microflora
of the gastrointestinal tract, diet of the population, as well as environmental factors such as
climate change1. As such, the Sponsor chose to present a range from a more recent literature
citation2 in conjunction with the recommendation that each clinical laboratory should verify the
transferability of the expected values to its own population, and if necessary, determine its own
reference interval according to good laboratory practice.
