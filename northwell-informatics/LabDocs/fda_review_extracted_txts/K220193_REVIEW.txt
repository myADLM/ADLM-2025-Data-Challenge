Preservation System (Copan FecalSwab) and BD FecalSwab Collection, Transport and
Preservation System (BD FecalSwab). The Copan FecalSwab is also co-branded as the BD
FecalSwab Collection, Transport and Preservation System (BD FecalSwab) and has been FDA-
cleared under K142094 (Copan Italia SpA, legal manufacturer); the terms Copan FecalSwab, BD
FecalSwab, and FecalSwab may be used interchangeably.
B Measurand:
Target DNA sequences with the BD MAX EPP detects nucleic acids from:
• Giardia lamblia
• Cryptosporidium (C. hominis and C. parvum only)
• Entamoeba histolytica
C Type of Test:
The BD MAX EPP is a Qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the
amplification and detection of DNA from Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium (C. hominis and C.
parvum only), and Entamoeba histolytica.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The BD MAX EPP performed on the BD MAX System is an automated in vitro diagnostic test
for the direct qualitative detection of enteric parasitic pathogens. The BD MAX EPP detects
nucleic acids from:
• Giardia lamblia
• Cryptosporidium (C. hominis and C. parvum only)
• Entamoeba histolytica
Testing is performed on unpreserved or 10% formalin-fixed stool specimens or FecalSwab
specimens from symptomatic patients with suspected gastroenteritis, enteritis or colitis. The
assay is intended to aid in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal infection when used in conjunction
with clinical evaluation and other laboratory findings. The test is performed directly on the
specimen, utilizing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of specific
targets. The test utilizes fluorogenic gene-specific hybridization probes for detection of the
amplified DNA.
This test is intended for use, in conjunction with clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and
epidemiological information, as an aid in the differential diagnosis of Giardia lamblia,
Cryptosporidium hominis, and C. parvum, as well as Entamoeba histolytica infections. Results of
this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient
management decision. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other organisms that are
K220193 - Page 2 of 21

--- Page 3 ---
not detected by this test, and may not be the sole or definitive cause of patient illness. Negative
results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis and/or colitis may be due
to infection by pathogens that are not detected ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or
Crohn’s disease.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
BD MAX EPP is performed on the BD MAX System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BD MAX EPP assay together with the BD MAX System contain an instrument with
associated hardware and accessories, disposable microfluidic cartridges, master mixes, unitized
reagent strips, and extraction reagents. The instrument automates sample preparation including
target lysis, DNA extraction and concentration, reagent rehydration, target nucleic acid
amplification and detection using real-time PCR. The assay includes a Sample Processing
Control (SPC) that is present in the Extraction Tube. The SPC monitors DNA extraction steps,
thermal cycling steps, reagent integrity and the presence of inhibitory substances. The BD
MAX System software automatically interprets test results. For the BD MAX EPP, a test result
may be called POS, NEG or UNR (Unresolved) based on the amplification status of the targets
and of the Sample Processing control. IND (Indeterminate) or INC (Incomplete) results are due
to BD MAX System failure.
B Principle of Operation:
The principles of the test remain unchanged from K143648, other than addition of stool
specimens collected with the FecalSwab Collection, Transport, and Preservation System as an
additional validated specimen type.
The BD MAX EPP is to be used with raw unpreserved stool specimens, 10% Formalin preserved
stool specimens or stool in FecalSwab specimens. Unpreserved samples are placed in a BD
MAX sample buffer tube (SBT) with a 10 µL transfer loop for analysis on the BD MAX System.
Specimens preserved in 10% Formalin utilizes a plastic paddle (scoop) to place a stool sample
into 15 ml of 10% Formalin media for transport before being placed into a SBT with a 10 µL
transfer loop prior to analysis on the BD MAX System.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
K220193 - Page 3 of 21

--- Page 4 ---
For the instrument:
BD MAX
For the assay:
BD MAX EPP
2. Specimen Identification:
Unpreserved or 10% formalin-fixed stool or FecalSwab unpreserved collected stool
specimens from symptomatic patients with suspected gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Once specimens (Unpreserved, 10% Formalin, or FecalSwab) are placed into a BD MAX
SBT, the principles of the test are as described in K143648.
The BD MAX EPP assay is designed for use on the BD MAX System (K111860), an
automated sample-to-answer processor that enables on-board extraction of nucleic acids and
PCR amplification to provide diagnostic results and remains unchanged from K143648. This
submission is only for the addition of a new collection/transport device (FecalSwab) to the
existing assay as performed on the BD MAX System. Since the previously cleared BD MAX
System hardware was not modified to accommodate the new collection device, electrical
safety evaluation is not required. Instrument software updates were reported regularly upon
new assay submissions.
No changes have been made to the BD MAX EPP assay contents, which are presented in

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-lab precision and reproducibility studies were evaluated previously using unpreserved
stool specimens. This represents the most challenging specimen type and therefore additional
studies were not conducted. See K143648 for the BD MAX EPP.
2. Linearity:
Not Applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical Specificity/Cross-Reactivity: Analytical specificity/cross-reactivity was evaluated
previously in the presence of unpreserved stool which represents the most challenging
specimen type. Please refer to K143648. No specificity issues were identified from additional
studies conducted to support testing FecalSwab stool specimens.
Interference Substances (exogenous/endogenous): Interfering substances were previously
evaluated in the presence of unpreserved stool which contains the highest concentration of
potential inhibitors. Please refer to K143648.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not Applicable
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Positive and Negative External Controls: External control materials are not provided by BD;
however, Quality Control material was previously addressed in the original submission,
please refer to K143648.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD) Study: An LoD study was conducted to demonstrate the
performance of the FecalSwab to preserve the target analytes for use with the BD Max EPP
assay. The LoD study was performed for each of the three (3) targets of this assay
(Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia) in FecalSwab specimens
following a two-phase study design. The study was designed to ensure the FecalSwab does
not introduce bias into the BD Max EPP assay. The LoD study prepared target analyte panels
in unpreserved stool matrix and FecalSwab. The BD MAX EPP Sample Buffer Tubes were
prepared for each specimen panel: unpreserved (UNP) stool specimens and FecalSwab (FS)
specimens.
In the first phase of the study, a preliminary LoD for each target was determined by testing
multiple replicate specimens (n=12) of each target in negative clinical matrix at low
concentrations until two critical concentrations were identified: a target concentration with
100% positive rate, and a lower concentration, within five-fold dilution, with a positive rate
greater than zero and less than 100%. The preliminary LoD was defined in this study as the
K220193 - Page 8 of 21

--- Page 9 ---
lowest target concentration with a 100% positive rate. Target concentrations used for each
spiked stool specimen for LoD determination is shown in Table 3.

Dilution 4 0.04x 961 64 101
Dilution 5 0.008x 192 13 20
In the second phase of the study, the size of the test panels was increased to 20 replicates per
concentration. The first concentration evaluated for each target was the preliminary LoD, as
determined in the first phase of the study. If the positive rate for this test panel was exactly
95% (19/20), the preliminary LoD would be ‘confirmed’ for that target and specimen type. If
the positive rate at the preliminary LoD was not 95%, additional testing would be conducted.
The sample from the initial LoD was run in 20 replicates and achieved a 19/20 positives
(95% positivity) rate and was considered the final LoD.
The LoD determination and confirmation positivity rates obtained for each Entamoeba
histolytica level tested are reported in Table 4. The LoD determination required an additional
dilution (4 orgs/mL stool) because the initial five dilutions obtained a positivity rate of 100%.
The initial LoD concentration for Entamoeba histolytica was 20 orgs/mL stool for both
FecalSwab and unpreserved specimens, corresponding to the lowest target level to achieve
100% positivity. Therefore, the confirmed LoD for Entamoeba histolytica target is 12
orgs/mL stool for both FecalSwab and unpreserved specimens, corresponding to the lowest
target level to achieve ≥ 95% positivity.

The LoD determination and confirmation positivity rates obtained for each Cryptosporidium
parvum level tested are reported in Table 5. The LoD determination step identified 961
orgs/mL stool as the initial Cryptosporidium parvum LoD for both FecalSwab and
unpreserved specimens, which corresponded to the lowest target level to achieve 100%
positivity. The initial LoD (961 orgs/mL stool) tested for the LoD confirmation step obtained
a positivity rate below 95%. The second level tested for LoD confirmation (4805 orgs/mL
stool) obtained a positivity rate of 100% for both FecalSwab and unpreserved specimens.
Therefore, the confirmed LoD for Cryptosporidium parvum target is 4805 orgs/mL stool for
both FecalSwab and unpreserved specimens, corresponding to the lowest target level to
achieve ≥ 95% positivity.

The LoD determination and confirmation of positivity rates obtained for each Giardia
lamblia level tested are reported in Table 6. The LoD determination step identified 320
orgs/mL stool as the initial Giardia lamblia LoD for both FecalSwab and unpreserved
specimens, corresponding to the lowest target level to achieve 100% positivity. The initial
LoD (320 orgs/mL stool) tested for the LoD confirmation step obtained a positivity rate
below 95%. The second level tested for LoD confirmation (1601 orgs/mL stool) obtained a
positivity rate of 100% for both FecalSwab and unpreserved specimens. Therefore, the

In summary the study confirmed LoD for each of the three target organisms, Entamoeba
histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Giardia lamblia, for the BD MAX EPP assay with
FecalSwab specimens. The study demonstrated that there is a similar analytical sensitivity for
detection of all targets when spiked into the FecalSwab device when compared to
unpreserved specimen run in parallel. The LoD values for each target in the FecalSwab
specimen was also similar to the LoD values from unpreserved stool specimen in the original
submission K143648.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Assay cut-offs remain unchanged from previously cleared versions of the BD MAX EPP
(K14143648).
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not Applicable
9. Carry-Over:
Carry-over was established previously using unpreserved stool in EBP sample buffer which
represents the worst-case scenario for carry-over contamination; therefore, additional studies
were not necessary, please refer to K143648.

User Variability Studies
The User variability studies were carried out to determine if the preparation of the FecalSwab
by different users introduces variability in the expected results for the BD MAX EPP assay.
Six (6) different users prepared two (2) different FecalSwab samples from each of five (5)
panel members made of one (1) negative panel member, three (3) panel members at 2x LoD,
and one (1) panel member at 4x LoD of co-spiked targets. As Giardia lamblia and
Cryptosporidium parvum are the most prevalent targets, they were used to evaluate user
variability of the BD MAX EPP assay. Once the FecalSwab samples were prepared by
various users, all subsequent steps, including the transfer to SBTs from each FecalSwab,
were performed by a single user. Acceptance criteria were: 100% negative results for the
twelve (12) negative samples, ≥95% positive results for the thirty-six (36) samples tested at
2x LoD, and 100% positive for the twelve (12) samples tested at 4x LoD. All samples
yielded the expected assay results. The assay results obtained for both targets in this study,
Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum, at each level tested are displayed in Table 7
and all conditions met acceptance criteria.

Specimen Stability Study
The purpose of the specimen stability study was to verify the preservation of amplifiable
DNA from Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, and Entamoeba histolytica in both the
FecalSwab collection device and SBT in specified storage conditions. The study was
conducted through the storage of prepared positive and negative samples at specified
temperatures and subsequent assay of the samples at selected stability test points using the
BD MAX System and the BD MAX EPP assay. In order to be consistent with the storage
conditions recommended in the current BD MAX EPP assay package insert for the two
previously validated specimen types (unpreserved (UNP) and 10% Formalin), BD performed
specimen stability testing to demonstrate that FecalSwab specimens were capable of being
stored at 25℃ ± 2oC for up to 48 hours or at 5℃ ± 3oC for up to 120 hours (5 days) prior to
testing. BD also confirmed that BD MAX EPP sample buffer tubes (SBTs) inoculated with
FecalSwab specimens can be stored under these same conditions prior to or after the pre-
warm step required for parasite testing as indicated in the labeling following a nested study
protocol.

To confirm the stability of samples in FecalSwab media under the same conditions as current
specimen claims, specimens were tested at baseline, after storage at each of the claimed
conditions. Both positive and negative specimens were tested, with positive specimens being
FecalSwab tubes containing pooled negative stool matrix spiked with a multiplex mixture
containing target analytes at 3× the assay LoD. Four positive FecalSwab tubes and one
negative FecalSwab tube from each of three lots were prepared for each time point, and two
BD MAX Sample Buffer Tubes were prepared from each FecalSwab tube. Therefore, a
minimum of 24 test results for positive specimens and six valid test results for negative
specimens were required at each test point. The nested stability protocol was to establish
stability of FecalSwab specimens after being transferred to the BD MAX EPP SBTs in two
separate arms. The first part evaluated the stability of inoculated sample buffer tubes stored
under the claimed stability conditions prior to the pre-warm processing step, while the second
part evaluated stability of the inoculated SBTs stored under the claimed stability conditions
after completion of the pre-warm step. All test points and storage conditions are shown in
Table 8. Specimens were created by spiking BD MAX EPP targets (Cryptosporidium
parvum, Giardia lamblia, and Entamoeba histolytica) into one clinical stool pool previously
determined to be negative for all BD MAX EPP targets. The stock concentrations,
unpreserved LoD concentration, and 3x LoD are shown in Table 9.

*The SBTs from Test Points 9, 10, 19 and 20 were stored 12 hours at 5 °C ± 3 °C before starting
the pre-Warm step, due to delayed availability of required equipment (pre-Warm stations). Since
the additional storage time for conditions 9, 10, 19 and 20 represents a worst case compared to
the original Test Points described in the protocol and is within the storage conditions included in
BD MAX EPP package insert, there is no impact on the study.

Acceptance criteria for FecalSwab specimens tested at baseline included the following:
• 100% detection for all targets in spiked samples, and 0% detection for all targets (except
the SPC internal control) in negative samples.
For all subsequent test points, the acceptance criteria were as follows:
• ≥95% detection for all targets in spiked samples, and 0% detection for all targets (except
the SPC internal control) in negative samples
For each time point, it was required that there be a minimum of 24 valid results for positive
and 6 valid results for negative samples. All results/test points passed the acceptance criteria
and demonstrate that FecalSwab specimens were capable of being stored at 25℃ ± 2oC for
up to 48 hours or at 5℃ ± 3oC for up to 120 hours (5 days) prior to testing. BD also
confirmed that BD MAX EPP sample buffer tubes (SBTs) inoculated with FecalSwab
specimens can be stored under these same conditions prior to or after the pre-warm step
required for parasite testing as indicated in the labeling for the previously cleared assay,

positive percent agreement (PPA) (sensitivity) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with
an expected point estimate of at least 95% for each target compared to the original reference
method algorithm for unpreserved stool in K143648. The main objective of this study was to
estimate the rate of unresolved (UNR) results that occur due to sample processing control
(SPC) failure and to estimate the rates of indeterminate (IND) results for FecalSwab stool.
The non-reportable rate (UNR/IND) for FecalSwab stool samples should not be more than
5%.
In the study design, the prospective collection and testing protocols utilized fresh,
unpreserved remnant stool specimens from patients suspected of acute gastroenteritis,
enteritis, or colitis. The prospective collections were only used to estimate the rate of
unresolved (UNR) results, as well as to estimate the rates of indeterminate (IND) and
incomplete (INC) results for a FecalSwab stool sample.
The retrospective collection and testing protocols utilized previously characterized
unpreserved retrospective stool specimens from subjects suspected of acute gastroenteritis,
enteritis, or colitis, and these specimens were stored frozen or at 4 – 8 °C. The goal of the
retrospective collection was to achieve 100 positive specimens on the BD MAX EPP assay
across all targets by supplementing the enrollment with samples collected. Contrived samples
were only used to demonstrate clinical agreement between the FecalSwab specimen type and
the unpreserved stool specimen type for the BD MAX EPP targets as the primary objective.
Specimen collection was performed at select external sites and the testing occurred at the BD
internal R&D laboratory.
The prospective collection protocol, utilized fresh, unpreserved remnant stool specimens
from patients suspected of acute gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis. Fresh, prospective
collection was performed at six (6) external sites. Samples collected were utilized in the
testing protocol for the exploratory objective. The prospective specimen collection site used a
protocol using the following steps on each specimen enrolled in the study.
• The FecalSwab collection device was used to transfer a portion of the specimen into the
FecalSwab tube, vortexed per user instructions, and then 150 µL of the FecalSwab tube
contents were pipetted into a properly labeled BD MAX EPP Sample Buffer Tube.
• The BD MAX EPP user instructions were used to directly transfer a portion of the
unpreserved stool specimen to a properly labeled BD MAX EPP Sample Buffer Tube.
• Both BD MAX EPP Sample Buffer Tubes were then shipped to BD for specimen testing
under the study test protocol.
Upon receipt at the BD testing laboratory, the FecalSwab specimens in the BD MAX EPP
Sample Buffer Tubes were tested as instructed. The Unpreserved Stool specimens were
processed through the pre-warm step and then frozen for future testing. The results from
evaluation of the prospectively collected specimens were used to calculate the non-reportable
rates.
The retrospective collection protocol enrolled previously characterized unpreserved remnant
stool specimens from subjects suspected of acute gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis, and
K220193 - Page 15 of 21

--- Page 16 ---
these specimens were stored frozen or at 4-8°C. There were two (2) external sites that
utilized this retrospective protocol. Additional frozen retrospective samples from the
previous clinical study already at the testing facility, and contrived samples were also
enrolled, where applicable. Another protocol had enrolled fresh, unpreserved remnant stool
specimens from patients suspected of acute gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis, and the
remnant specimens obtained during that clinical study and have been stored frozen.
Retrospective and contrived samples were evaluated under the testing protocol to evaluate
the primary objective (to demonstrate clinical agreement between the FecalSwab specimen
type and the unpreserved stool specimen type for the BD MAX EPP targets).
For testing of the retrospective samples, each frozen or refrigerated, unpreserved remnant
specimen was brought to room temperature and tested using the BD MAX EPP assay per
manufacturer's instructions by an internal BD R&D team. If the result from this test was
concordant with the historical result provided by the vendor or the previous study result, then
the unpreserved stool was provided to the BD Clinical Team. Per FDA guidance from
previous communications, if the unpreserved BD MAX EPP assay result was discordant with
the historical result, then the unpreserved specimen was tested 2 more times using the BD
MAX EPP assay and a 2-out-of-3 algorithm applied to obtain truth. Once the "truth" of the
unpreserved stool specimen had been established, it was provided to the BD Clinical team for
FecalSwab preparation and testing. The unpreserved stool was transferred to a FecalSwab
device, and that material was then pipetted into an EPP-labeled SBT and tested with the BD
MAX EPP assay by the Clinical Team. The EPP FecalSwab result was compared to the final
unpreserved specimen result. The same testing procedure was applied to retrospective
specimens.
Since the workflow for all specimen types (Unpreserved or FecalSwab) is identical after
the specimens are placed into the SBT, BD MAX analysis (testing of the SBT on the BD
MAX system) was performed internally (BD R&D laboratory). Additionally, previous
clinical studies for the BD MAX EPP (K143648) Assays have demonstrated that the
variability between reagent lots, MAX instruments, and users do not impact the results of the
assay. The BD MAX EPP assay was performed according to the clinical trial package insert,
BD MAX. Instrument Manual and the Clinical Trial Training Manual. All runs were
performed by trained employees who demonstrated proficiency prior to testing. The BD
MAX / FecalSwab Study compliant external control rate is summarized in Table 10.

Any sample included in a run in which an external control failed, or any sample for which an
Unresolved, Indeterminate, or Incomplete result was obtained, was retested from the same
Sample Buffer Tube along with valid external controls. If any targets of the panel have an
unresolved or indeterminate result, then the result of the combined assay was defined as
"non-reportable". BD Max non-reportable results categorizations are shown in Table 11.

failure least one external control (positive or negative) does not give the
expected result.
In addition to these specimens, contrived specimens were prepared for Entamoeba
histolytica. 50% of the contrived specimens were to be prepared at 1.5x - 2x LoD in a unique
(not pooled) specimen matrix consisting of a single negative stool specimen and collected
using the FecalSwab. A total of 53 positive and 53 negative specimens were prepared using
53 unique negative specimen matrices that had been previously determined to be negative for
all targeted analytes, per FDA request shown in Table 12.

The overall PPA and NPA for the FecalSwab compared to the current unpreserved specimen
collection is provided in Table 13. The NPA acceptance criteria were met for all target
organisms in the retrospective testing. However, Cryptosporidium (C. hominis and C.
parvum only) and Entamoeba histolytica did not meet the expected PPA performance, either
with a PPA point estimate under 95% or with a 95% confidence interval around the PPA
estimate extending below 90%. Giardia lamblia met the expected PPA point estimate but the
95% confidence interval around the PPA estimate extended below 90%.
In summary, the unexpected results arise from the low prevalence of positive specimens
observed for the targets and target concentrations near or below the LoD.

Individual organism’s data comparisons are shown below. The data in Table 14 demonstrates
that although the PPA lower bound for Giardia lamblia extends below 90%, the performance
of the FecalSwab specimens is comparable with the performance of the unpreserved
specimens. As all specimens with discrepant results have the target at or near the LoD based
on Ct values, the degree of variability observed here is not surprising. In addition, the number
of positive specimens in the study was less than the target number (~100 positive samples),
which results in wider confidence intervals.

Cryptosporidium (C. hominis and C. parvum only) met the FDA's expected NPA
performance goal (NPA: 99.8 % (95% CI: 99.1%, 100.0%)). Cryptosporidium (C. hominis
and C. parvum only) had a 90.9% PPA with a 95% CI of 84.1% - 95.0% that does not meet
the FDA's expected PPA performance goal (≥95% with the lower bound of the two-sided
95% confidence interval exceeding 90%). As described in Table 15, there were ten samples
that were unpreserved Positive (POS) and FecalSwab Negative (NEG) and one sample that
was unpreserved Negative (NEG) and FecalSwab Positive (POS). All discrepant samples
were at or near the LoD. Stool samples with low target loads (at or near the LoD) have a
higher probability of not being detected due to insufficient target DNA delivery to the PCR
cartridge. Therefore, the likelihood of reproducible positive/negative results for samples near
or at the LoD is variable. Additionally, three of the discrepant samples required 2-out-of-3
testing due to this variability at or near LoD.

Entamoeba histolytica met the FDA's desirable NPA performance goal (NPA: 100.0% (95%
CI: 99.5%, 100.0%)). Entamoeba histolytica had 80.0% PPA with a 95% CI of 37.6% -
96.4%, that does not meet the FDA's desirable PPA performance goal (≥95% with the lower
bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval exceeding 90%). As described in Table 16,
there was one sample that was unpreserved Positive (POS) and FecalSwab Negative (NEG).
The one discrepant sample was below the LoD. Stool samples with low target loads (at or
near the LoD) have a higher probability of not being detected due to insufficient target DNA
delivery to the PCR cartridge. Therefore, the likelihood of reproducible positive/negative
results for samples near or at the LoD is variable. In addition, since the positive sample size
was low, contrived testing was performed and met the FDA's desirable performance goal
with no discrepant results (Table 17).
The data demonstrates that although the PPA is lower than the expected 95%-point estimate,
and the 95% confidence interval around that estimate extends below 90% for Entamoeba
histolytica, the performance of the FecalSwab specimens is comparable with the performance
of the unpreserved specimens. As all specimens with discrepant results have the target at or
near the LoD based on Ct values, the degree of variability observed here is not surprising. In
addition, the number of positive specimens in the study was less than the target number
(~100 positive samples), which results in wider confidence intervals.

In conclusion, the evidence provided herein indicates that the FecalSwab specimen type
performs comparably to the currently market authorized unpreserved specimen type. The
observation that some of the assay targets had a PPA point estimate or confidence interval
around the PPA estimate that were lower than FDA's expected performance is due to either
low prevalence of positive specimens or specimens containing target organisms at or below
the LoD. For Entamoeba histolytica that had few positive specimens, contrived testing was
performed and met the FDA's desirable performance goal (≥95% with the lower bound of the
two-sided 95% confidence interval exceeding 90%), further supporting the claim that
FecalSwab performance is substantially equivalent to performance of the current unpreserved
specimen collection when tested on BD MAX EPP assay. All discrepant samples across all
targets are consistent with low titer specimens at or near the limit of detection of the BD
MAX EPP on the BD MAX System. Additionally, the exploratory objective of this study met
the acceptance criteria with a nonreportable rate (NRR) of ≤ 5% (Table 18).
