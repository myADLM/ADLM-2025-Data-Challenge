IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Reagents for the Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT assay are packaged in a plastic Flex
reagent cartridge and sealed with lidstock film. The Flex reagent cartridge is loaded by the end
user onto the Dimension EXL integrated chemistry system with LOCI Module for test
processing. Each Flex reagent cartridge contains eight (8) wells with the following components:
1. Biotinylated Antibody: PCT Biotinylated mouse monoclonal antibody, bovine serum
albumin, bovine gamma globulin, goat serum, mouse IgG, rat IgG, sodium azide
(<0.1%), buffer, preservatives, and stabilizers. Located in Wells 1 and 2 of cartridge.
2. Chemibead: PCT Chemibead reagent, bovine serum albumin, bovine gamma globulin,
goat serum, sodium azide (<0.1%), buffer, preservatives, and stabilizers. Located in
Wells 3 and 4 of cartridge.
3. Sensibead: PCT Sensibead reagent, bovine serum albumin, buffer, preservatives, and
stabilizers. Located in Wells 5 and 6 of cartridge.
4. Assay buffer: Assay buffer, bovine serum albumin, bovine gamma globulin, goat serum,
mouse IgG, sodium azide (<0.1%), preservatives, and stabilizers. Located in Wells 7 and
8 of cartridge.
Additional materials that are required, but not provided with the assay:
1. Dimension EXL LOCI PCT CAL (Calibrator): 5 levels of calibrators:
a. Calibrator Level 1: bovine albumin and preservatives
b. Calibrator levels 2-5: Human serum-based product containing recombinant PCT
and preservatives.
2. Commercially available quality control materials
B Principle of Operation:
The Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT assay is a homogeneous sandwich chemiluminescent
immunoassay based on LOCI technology. The LOCI reagents include two synthetic bead
reagents and one biotinylated anti‐procalcitonin (anti‐PCT) monoclonal antibody. The first bead
reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitizer dye. The second
bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with two anti‐PCT monoclonal antibodies and contains
chemiluminescent dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form
bead‐PCT‐biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form
bead‐pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen
from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction.
The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the procalcitonin (PCT)
concentration in the sample.
The system automatically performs the following steps:
1. Dispenses 20 μL of Reagent 1 (biotinylated antibody reagent) into a LOCI vessel. Waits
48 seconds.
2. Dispenses 5 μL of sample and 15 μL of water, then incubates for 12.6 seconds at 37°C.
3. Dispenses 20 μL of Reagent 2 (Chemibeads reagent) into the vessel, then incubates for 20
minutes.
K220262 - Page 3 of 27

--- Page 4 ---
4. Dispenses 20 μL of Reagent 3 (Sensibeads reagent) and 10 μL of water into the vessel,
then incubates for 1.5 minutes.
5. Dispenses 100 μL of Reagent 4 (Assay buffer) and 55 μL water into the vessel.
6. Mixes and incubates the mixture at 37°C for 1 minute.
7. Measures the signal.
8. Reports results.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Laboratory Precision Study:
A study was performed to evaluate repeatability and within-lab precision of the Dimension
EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT assay. Nine samples consisting of five serum pools, one plasma
pool, and three QC samples were evaluated. All serum and plasma pools contained native
patient specimens with PCT at or near the following medical decision level concentrations:
0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 2.00, and 10.00 ng/mL. The quality control samples were MAS Omni
CARDIO Level L (QC1), MAS Omni IMMUNE Level 1 (QC2), and BioRad Lyphochek
Specialty Immunoassay Control Level 1 (QC3). All QC samples were stored and handled
according to their respective IFUs.
Testing followed a 20x2x2 design: 20 days of testing with two runs per day and two
replicates per run for a total of 40 runs and 80 replicates per sample. Testing was performed
with two Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT reagent lots and one calibrator lot on one
Dimension EXL 200 system by one trained operator. Acceptance criteria for serum and
plasma samples with concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.10 ng/mL was a repeatability of
≤15.0% CV and within-lab of ≤20.0% CV. Acceptance criteria for serum and plasma
samples with PCT concentrations >0.10 ng/mL was a repeatability of ≤10.0% CV and
within-lab of ≤15.0% CV. Summary of the within-lab precision study results are described in
Tables 1 and 2 below.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was performed to evaluate the validity of the proposed analytical measuring
interval of the Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT assay. Two (2) human serum pools
with a PCT concentration >50.00 ng/mL (High) were mixed with a normal human serum
sample with a PCT concentration <0.05 ng/mL (Low) to create a series of 16 dilutions to
evaluate the analytical measuring range. Fourteen of the 16 dilutions were within the
proposed range of 0.05 ng/mL to 50.00 ng/mL. Five (5) replicate measurements were taken
per sample. One (1) operator used one (1) Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT reagent lot
and one (1) calibrator lot to conduct this linearity study. Linearity was assessed by
calculating bias for each sample as the difference between the mean observed value and the
value predicted by a weighted least squares linear regression model. Each linearity level was
required to have ≤20% or ≤0.04 ng/mL absolute bias for the observed vs. predicted values
from the weighted least squares linear regression model. Linearity study results are presented
in Table 7. The best fit line for the linearity data had a slope of 0.906 and an intercept of
0.029.

The study demonstrates linearity for the analytical measuring interval of 0.05 to 50.00 ng/mL
for the Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT assay.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference:
A study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS
PCT assay in the presence of potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances.
Samples consisted of human serum pools at approximately 0.25 ng/mL PCT, a low medical
decision level (LMDL), and 2.00 ng/mL PCT, a high medical decision level (HMDL),
prepared by pooling native PCT. Each pool was divided into individual aliquots for control
and test pools. The test pools were spiked with the potentially interfering substances and the
control pools were spiked with an equivalent volume of diluent. One operator conducted the
study with two calibrator lots over four calibration intervals on one Dimension EXL 200
system with three replicates per test sample. Bias was calculated according to the following
equation: ((Test Mean – Control Mean Concentration)/(Control Mean Concentration))x100.
Samples with observed bias >±10% were evaluated by a dose respond method to determine
the interference profile. Interference study results are presented in Tables 8-11.

Interference was evaluated with biotin at a concentration of 14.4 µmol/L, which resulted in a
significant negative bias at the LMDL and HMDL concentrations of PCT. Therefore, the
biotin concentration was titrated to multiple lower concentrations until the bias was
acceptable at both PCT MDLs. A biotin concentration of 6.1 µmol/L negatively impacts PCT
concentrations near the HMDL without impact the LMDL, but biotin concentrations less than
or equal to 4.9 µmol/L have an acceptable bias at the HMDL. Table 9 summarizes
interference testing with biotin at multiple concentrations.

Cross-Reactivity:
A study was conducted was to evaluate the performance of the Dimension EXL LOCI
BRAHMS PCT assay in the presence of potentially cross-reacting substances. Samples
consisted of human serum pools at approximately 0.25 ng/mL PCT, a low medical decision
level (LMDL), and 2.00 ng/mL PCT, a high medical decision level (HMDL), prepared by
pooling native PCT. Each pool was divided into individual aliquots for control and test pools.
Stock solutions of each cross‐reactant were prepared at 20x the test concentration. The test
pools were spiked with the potentially interfering cross-reactant to achieve the target
concentration and the control pools were spiked with an equivalent volume of diluent.
One operator conducted the study with one calibrator lots over one calibration interval on one
Dimension EXL 200 system with three replicates per test sample. The percent of cross-
reactivity was calculated according to the following equation: ((Test Mean – Control Mean
Concentration)/(Compound Concentration))x100. Cross-reactivity study results are presented
in Table 12.

There is no significant cross-reactivity observed with the substances tested, therefore cross-
reactivity study results are acceptable.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Please refer to results from Linearity (section 2), Detection Limits (section 6), and Extended
Measuring Interval (Section 8) studies for the validated assay reportable range.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Calibrator Traceability:
An International Reference for PCT is not available. Values assigned to the Dimension EXL
LOCI PCT CAL are traceable to a reference preparation of PCT. The standardization is
maintained through patient‐sourced internal standards verified using the BRAHMS PCT
sensitive KRYPTOR assay known as the anchor pool. Assigned values for master and
product level calibrators, which are contrived from human serum spiked with recombinant
PCT at various concentrations, are traceable to the anchor pool. Five individual calibrators
include a negative sample containing bovine albumin and preservatives and four other serum-
based samples that contain PCT concentrations of 0.5, 2.0, 25.0, and 55.0 ng/mL. The assay
should be calibrated with the Dimension EXL LOCI PCT CAL every 7 days and when
changing lot numbers of reagents, when indicated by QC results, and after major
maintenance or service.
Acceptance Criteria for Stability Studies:
Several studies were conducted to evaluate calibrator, reagent, and sample stability.
Generally, samples were evaluated over several timepoints, and an ordinary least squares
linear regression was calculated using the mean values for each time point (y-axis) versus
time (x-axis). If the regression slope was statistically significant, then the stability duration
was taken as the final time point where the percent change in sample performance at the time
point versus the initial was ≤ LoD (0.04 ng/mL) at concentrations ≤0.10 ng/mL, ≤15% at
concentrations ≤0.50 ng/mL, and ≤10% at concentrations >0.50 ng/mL. Unless indicated
otherwise, the same acceptance criteria were used for all reagent and sample stability studies.
Calibrator Shelf-Life:
For the calibrator shelf-life studies, test sample calibrators are stored at ‐20°C. Control
sample calibrators are stored at ‐70°C. A calibration is performed at each time point (n = 5
replicates per calibrator level) using calibrators stored at the control condition (‐70°C). Fresh
Flex reagent cartridges are used for both calibration and sample processing at each time
point. The real time shelf-life stability testing is ongoing with three Dimension EXL LOCI
BRAHMS PCT Calibrator lots and the protocols were reviewed and found acceptable.
Calibrator Interval Validation:
The calibration interval was evaluated by following CLSI EP25-A. Three reagent cartridge
lots were loaded and tested for each time point over a minimum of eight days. Testing for all
time points included five calibrator levels, three quality control levels, and six serum pools.
Each sample was measured with five replicates per time point. Calibration was performed at
K220262 - Page 15 of 27

[Table 1 on page 15]
Calcitonin (salmon)	30 µg/L	1.78	0.07

--- Page 16 ---
the beginning of each study. All testing was completed by one trained operator using one
calibrator lot for each reagent lot and one Dimension EXL 200 system.
Testing demonstrated the Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT assay on the Dimension
EXL 200 system can support a seven-day calibration interval.
Unopened Onboard Stability:
Two Flex reagent cartridge lots were loaded onto the instrument and stored unopened ≥30
days. At the end of the storage period, Flexes stored onboard were tested and compared to
freshly loaded Flexes. Testing for all time points included five calibrator levels, three quality
control levels, and six serum pools. Each sample was tested with freshly loaded Flexes and
Flexes stored unopened onboard the instrument for ≥30 days. The mean observed PCT result
was calculated for each condition. Data analysis was based on the difference in recoveries
from onboard unopened Flexes compared to freshly loaded Flexes (control).
Study results supported a claim of 30 days for unopened onboard Flex reagent cartridges.
Opened Onboard Stability:
Three Flex reagent cartridge lots were loaded into the instrument and stored open for five
days. The study used Flex wells opened on day zero of the study (one well set was opened
for each sample) in order to consume at least 80% of the tests in each well set over the
duration of the study. Testing for all time points included five calibrator levels, three quality
control levels, and six serum pools.
Study results supported a claim of three days for opened onboard Flex reagent cartridges.
Sample Stability Studies:
Specimens from the following tube types were prepared and tested at each medical decision
level and the upper limit of the analytical measuring interval: Serum Separator Tube (SST),
Rapid Serum Tube (RST), and plasma (anticoagulants: lithium heparin (Li Hep), sodium
heparin (Na Hep), dipotassium EDTA (K2EDTA), and tripotassium EDTA (K3EDTA)). All
specimens were prepared by spiking fresh specimens with native PCT at the desired
concentration levels. The following sample stability conditions were evaluated :
1. Room Temperature: Samples were stored at 25˚C for ≥8 hours and tested at 0, 2, 4, 6,
8, and 10 hours. Study results supported a specimen stability claim of 8 hours at room
temperature.
2. Refrigerated Temperature: Samples were stored at 2-8˚C for ≥ 24 hours and tested at
0, 4, 22, 24, and 26 hours. Study results supported a specimen stability claim of 24
hours at refrigerated temperatures (2-8˚C).
3. Frozen (-70˚C): Samples were stored at -70˚C and tested at time 0 and monthly
thereafter, with a minimum of one (1) time point every 90 days. Study results
supported a specimen stability claim of 90 days in a -70˚C freezer.
4. Frozen (-20˚C): Samples were stored at -20˚C and tested at time 0 and monthly
thereafter, with a minimum of one (1) time point every 90 days. Study results
supported a specimen stability claim of 90 days in a -20˚C freezer.
5. Freeze-Thaw: Samples were frozen at -20˚C and thawed at 2-8˚C up tosix (6) times.
Samples were tested after the completion of the freeze‐thaw cycles and results from
each freeze‐thaw were compared to recoveries at time 0 (fresh specimens) before any
K220262 - Page 16 of 27

--- Page 17 ---
specimens were frozen. Study results supported a specimen stability claim of up to 6
freeze-thaw cycles.
6. On the System: Samples were stored on the sample wheel onboard in the instrument
for the duration of the study (≥ 1 hour) and tested at time points 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and
2.0 hours. Study results supported a specimen stability claim of 1 hour on the
instrument.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank:
The limit of blank (LoB) was identified as the highest value detected in study results with
human serum that contains no PCT. Four blank serum specimens (normal human serum
containing no PCT) were tested with five replicates per day over a period of three days,
which yielded a total of 60 measurements per reagent lot. One operator conducted the study
with two lots of Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT reagents and one calibrator lot during
one calibration interval on one Dimension EXL 200 system.
The data support the claimed LoB of 0.03 ng/mL.
Limit of Detection:
The limit of detection (LoD) was identified as the lowest concentration of PCT that could be
consistently detected with a specified level of statistical confidence. Four low PCT serum
specimens (normal human serum) were tested with five replicates per day over a period of
three days, which yielded a total of 60 measurements per reagent lot. One operator conducted
the study with two lots of Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT reagents and one calibrator
lot during one calibration interval on one Dimension EXL 200 system.
The data support the claimed LoD of 0.04 ng/mL.
Limit of Quantitation:
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was identified as the lowest concentration of PCT that could
be measured with respect to predefined accuracy goals. Five normal human serum samples
with low PCT levels were tested for 20 test days with two runs/day results in 40 runs.
Samples were tested in duplicate producing a total of 80 results for each reagent lot. One
operator conducted the study with two lots of Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT
reagents and one calibrator lot during one calibration interval on one Dimension EXL 200
system. For each reagent lot, the within‐laboratory precision for each sample, expressed as
%CV, was plotted against the mean concentration obtained for each sample. This data set
was fitted using a power function to give a precision profile. Functional sensitivity for each
reagent lot was determined as the analyte concentration corresponding to the intersection of
20% CV with the precision profile.
The data support the claimed LoQ of 0.05 ng/mL.

8. Extended Measuring Interval – Manual Dilution:
K220262 - Page 17 of 27

--- Page 18 ---
The purpose of the extended measuring interval study was to evaluate the validity of the
extended analytical measuring interval of 50.00-1000.00 ng/mL with the Dimension EXL
LOCI BRAHMS PCT assay based on a manual dilution recovery study. Ten native serum
specimens with concentrations of PCT greater than 50 ng/mL, the upper limit of the
analytical measuring interval, were identified through using the predicate device, the
B·R·A·H·M·S PCT Sensitive KRYPTOR on the KRYPTOR Test System, to determine the
reference value. Two operators executed the study using one Dimension EXL LOCI
BRAHMS PCT reagent lot during one calibration interval on one Dimension EXL 200
system. Serum specimens were manually diluted in saline at a dilution factor of 1:20. Each
operator prepared two 1:20 dilution samples per specimen and five replicates taken per
samples. The mean result was calculated for each sample and multiplied by the dilution
factor of 1:20 to determine the estimated value. Manual dilution recovery was calculated
using the following equation: (Estimate Value ÷ Reference Value) x 100. Predefined
acceptance criteria was the recovery within ±20%. Extended measuring interval study results
are presented in Table 13.

Extended measuring interval study results are acceptable.
9. Hook Effect:
To test for High Dose “Hook Effect” associated with high concentration PCT samples, one
≥2,000 ng/mL PCT serum sample (fresh native serum spiked with recombinant PCT) was
diluted with saline to create seven PCT levels ranging from 4.27 ng/mL to 2,051.68 ng/mL.
Concentrations within the analytical measuring interval were determined based on instrument
values, whereas concentrations >50.00 ng/mL were calculated. Each level was tested in
replicates of five with three assay reagent lots and one Dimension EXL 200 instrument. All
testing was completed in one day by one operator using one calibrator lot and one calibration
per reagent lot. The study demonstrates the assay is free of hook effects up to 2,000.00
ng/mL of PCT and neat patient samples with PCT concentrations between 50.00 ng/mL and
2000.00 ng/mL will report as “Above Assay Range”.

A study was performed to evaluate whether sample carryover occurs during use of the
Dimension EXL system with the Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT assay. Briefly, 21
samples containing high (1068.88 ng/mL) and low (≤0.10 ng/mL) concentrations of PCT
were tested in a designated order. Analyses were conducted between the values obtained
when a low concentration sample was preceded by another low concentration sample and
when a low concentration sample was preceded by a high concentration sample. Table 14
summarizes the results of the sample carryover study.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare performance of the Dimension EXL
LOCI BRAHMS PCT assay to that of the primary predicate device B·R·A·H·M·S PCT
sensitive KRYPTOR assay. Samples consisted of 595 native human serum samples within
the analytical and extended measuring intervals (0.05-1000.00 ng/mL). All samples were
tested on the candidate and predicate PCT assays. Testing was completed by three operators
over seven calibration intervals with two Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT reagent lots
and two calibrator lots one Dimension EXL 200 system. Data analysis was completed with
the 595 samples spanning the analytical and extended measuring intervals for each candidate
PCT assay reagent lot compared to the primary predicate PCT assay.
The PCT range of samples tested are found in Table 15.

The acceptance criteria for Passing-Bablok regression analysis were that the candidate assay
should demonstrate a slope within or equal to 1.00 ± 0.10, a y‐intercept of ≤ LoQ (0.05
ng/mL), when compared to the predicate assay (B·R·A·H·M·S PCT sensitive KRYPTOR).
When analyzed by ordinary linear regression, the correlation coefficient (r) should be greater
than or equal to 0.950. Pre-specified performance criteria at each medical decision level of
PCT are defined below:
• 0.10 and 0.25 ng/mL PCT: PPA ≥ 75%, NPA ≥ 75%
• 0.50 and 2.00 ng/mL PCT: PPA ≥ 85%, NPA ≥ 85%

2. Matrix Comparison:
The objective of the matrix comparison study was to evaluate the effect of anticoagulants in
plasma, the candidate specimen type, compared to serum samples, the primary specimen
type, when tested with the Dimension EXL LOCI BRAHMS PCT assay. Matched sets of 76
specimens consisting of serum, lithium heparin plasma (LiHep), sodium heparin plasma
(NaHep), dipotassium EDTA plasma (K2EDTA), and tripotassium EDTA plasma
(K3EDTA) spanning the analytical measuring interval of 0.05 to 50.00 ng/mL were used.
Matched samples were spiked with equal amounts of recombinant PCT to span the AMI and
tested in duplicate. Results were analyzed using Passing‐Bablok regression and the serum
SST values on the x‐axis. Pre-specified acceptance criteria of the slope within 1.00 ± 0.10
and the y-intercept of 0.00 ± 0.20. Passing-Bablok linear regression graphs are shown in
Figures 3-7 for each candidate specimen type.

The acceptance criteria were met for all comparisons. Performance for RST, LiHep plasma,
NaHep plasma, K2EDTA plasma, and K3EDTA plasma was equivalent to the SST. Serum
(SST and RST) and plasma (Lithium Heparin, Sodium Heparin, K2EDTA, and K3EDTA)
are the recommended sample types for this assay.

28-day morality:
ΔPCT ≤ 80%
• A decrease in the PCT levels below or equal to 80% defines a positive ΔPCT test
result representing a higher risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed
with severe sepsis or septic shock.
ΔPCT > 80%
• A decrease in the PCT levels of more than 80% defines a negative ΔPCT test result
representing a lower risk for 28-day all-cause mortality of patients diagnosed with
severe sepsis or septic shock.
Progression Risk:
• PCT > 2 ng/mL: A PCT level above 2.0 ng/mL on the first day of ICU admission is
associated with a high risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
• PCT < 0.5 ng/mL: A PCT level below 0.5 ng/mL on the first day of ICU admission
is associated with a low risk for progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
LRTI Antibiotic Decision Making:
Initiation:
• PCT < 0.10 ng/mL: Antibiotic therapy strongly discouraged.
• PCT 0.10-0.25 ng/mL: Antibiotic therapy discouraged.
• PCT 0.26-0.50 ng/mL: Antibiotic therapy encouraged.
• PCT >0.50 ng/mL: Antibiotic therapy strongly encouraged.
Discontinuation:
• PCT ≤ 0.25 ng/mL: Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued.
• ΔPCT > 80%: Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued
Sepsis Antibiotic Discontinuation:
• ΔPCT > 80%: Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued
• PCT ≤ 0.50 ng/mL: Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Reference interval testing was conducted with 33 specimens from apparently healthy individuals
and the demographic information is presented in Table 24.

Age n % of total n (male) % of total (male) n (female) % of total (female)
Age <60 29 87.88 18 54.55 11 33.33
Age ≥60 4 12.12 0 0.00 4 12.12
Total 33 100.00 18 54.55 15 45.45
Reference interval verification testing was completed for the following sample types: serum
(Serum Separator Tube (SST) and Rapid Serum Tube (RST)) and plasma (Lithium Heparin,
Sodium Heparin, K2EDTA, and K3EDTA). All testing was completed by one trained operator
with one reagent lot and one calibrator lot over two calibration intervals on one Dimension EXL
200 system. Reference range study results are presented in Table 25.
