VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the ADVIA Centaur® NT-proBNPII (PBNPII) assay run on
the ADVIA Centaur XP system was established in several studies following the
recommendations of CLSI EP05-A3.
Within-Lab Precision
The within-lab performance was established. In the study, six native serum sample pools
spanning approximately each medical decision level and three controls were assayed in
replicates of two per run, two runs per day over 20 days using one reagent lot for a total of 80
measurements. The data were analyzed for repeatability and within-lab %CV using the
ANOVA method consistent with the recommendations of CLSI EP05-A3. The results are
summarized below.

Between-Lab reproducibility
The reproducibility performance was established with a multi-site precision evaluation.
Samples for testing were comprised of 8 native patient serum pools and three controls. In the
study, each sample was tested at three sites using the same three lots of reagents. Each
sample was assayed in replicates of three per run, two runs per day over five days for 30
measurements per lot per site, or for a total of 270 measurements across the three sites. The
data was analyzed using a random effects model to estimate the variance components of
within-run, between run, between day, between lot, and between sites.

2. Linearity:
The linearity performance of the ADVIA Centaur® NT-proBNPII (PBNPII) assay run on the
ADVIA Centaur XP system was establish in a study following the recommendations of CLSI
EP06, 2nd Edition. Samples for testing were comprised of two linearity panels each with 10
concentration levels. Each linearity panel was a dilution series prepared by intermixing
known volumes of high and low sample pools of native human serum. The low pool was a
non-zero sample. In the study, each sample (of the 20 total) was assayed in replicates of
seven on one instrument using each of three reagent lots. The linearity was analyzed
separately for each reagent lot. Using a weighted linear regression model, the difference
between the mean observed value and the value predicted by the weighted linear regression
model was derived. At each concentration, the deviation from linearity was less than 10%.
The sponsor concluded that the assay yields a linear response over the claimed NT-proBNP
measuring range of 35 to 35,000 pg/mL.
Sample Dilution
Serum and plasma samples with concentrations up to 63,128 pg/mL can be measured after a
5-fold dilution or 10-fold dilution. The percent recovery of diluted samples ranged from
80.5% to 87.2%.

The analytical specificity performance of the ADVIA Centaur® NT-proBNPII (PBNPII) was
established by conducting a cross-reactivity study and interference testing for endogenous
and exogenous substances, consistent with CLSI EP07, 3rd Edition and CLSI EP37, 1st
Edition.
Endogenous substances
Interference from endogenous substances was assessed using serum samples with NT-
proBNP at approximate concentrations of 125 pg/mL and 2000 pg/mL. Each of the two
samples was further divided into two aliquots for a control sample (with no added interferent)
and test sample (with added interferent). For screening, each sample was assayed in
replicates of 8 using three lots of reagent packs on one instrument. No significant
interference, defined by the sponsor as within ±10% difference in the mean for the test
sample versus the mean of the control sample, was observed at the following concentrations:

A study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the ADVIA Centaur NT-proBNPII
(PBNPII) in the presence of cross reactants. In the study, two samples were prepared from
human serum pools- low and high. Each serum pool was then spiked with cross-reactive
substance to form a test sample or spiked with solvent to form a control sample. Each sample
was assayed in replicates of 8. The % cross-reactivity was calculated as:
% cross-reactivity = 100% x (test conc. – control conc.) / cross-reactant conc.

High dose hook effect
The ADVIA Centaur® NT-proBNPII (PBNPII) assay was evaluated for high dose hook
effect using 10 concentration levels of NT-proBNP. The results support that the ADVIA
Centaur® NT-proBNPII (PBNPII) assay does not show a high dose hook effect up to
300,000 pg/mL of NT-proBNP.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
35 to 35,000 pg/mL
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Metrological traceability
The metrological traceability of the ADVIA Centaur® NT-proBNPII (PBNPII) assay was
reviewed and found acceptable.
Sample Stability
The sponsor provided data to support sample stability at different temperatures and
conditions:
• After centrifugation, serum specimens stored on the clot are stable for up to 24 hours at
2–8°C.
• Separated samples are stable for up to 3 days at room temperature, and for up to 4 days
at 2–8°C.
• Separated samples are stable at ≤ -20°C for up to 12 months.
6. Detection Limit:
The detection capability of the ADVIA Centaur® NT-proBNPII (PBNPII) run on the
ADVIA Centaur XP system was evaluated for limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD),
and limit of quantitation (LoQ) following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB
Samples for LoB testing consisted of four blank native human serum samples preselected for
low NT-proBNP levels. In the study, LoB was determined separately for each of three
reagent lots using one instrument. With each lot, the four samples were each assayed in 12
replicates per run, one run per day over 5 days for a total of 60 measurements per sample per
reagent lot. The LoB was calculated non-parametrically. The LoB was calculated separately
for each reagent lot and the highest value was taken as the LoB value; 13 pg/mL.
LoD
Samples for the LoD study consisted of 10 low NT-proBNP in native human serum and
pooled human serum. In the study, LoD was determined separately for each of three reagent
lots using one instrument. With each lot, the samples were each assayed in replicates of 8
per run, with one run per day over five days for a total of 40 measurements per sample per
reagent lot. The parametric approach described in EP17-A2 was followed to determine the
K220265 - Page 10 of 22

--- Page 11 ---
LoD. The highest observed LoD of the three lots was the reported LoD for the assay; 20
pg/mL.
LoQ
Samples for the LoQ study consisted of 10 low NT-proBNP in native human serum and
pooled human serum. In the study, LoQ was determined separately for each of three reagent
lots using one instrument. With each lot, the samples were each assayed in replicates of 8
per run, with one run per day over five days for a total of 40 measurements per sample per
reagent lot. For each reagent lot, the within-laboratory precision for each sample, expressed
as %CV, was plotted against the mean concentration obtained for each sample. LoQ was
determined by the concentration where a power function model fit to the data equaled 20%
CV. The largest estimate across all reagent lots was 35 pg/mL.
The summary results for LoB, LoD and LoQ are shown below.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
See Section VII D.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not Applicable: see clinical studies in Section C.
2. Matrix Comparison:
The assay is intended for use with serum and plasma (EDTA and lithium heparin).
A matrix equivalency study to serum (no gel barrier) was conducted to support use of the
ADVIA Centaur® NT-proBNPII (PBNPII) run on the ADVIA Centaur XP system with
additional specimen matrix types claimed in the product labeling: Serum (no gel barrier),
SST serum tube (gel barrier), RST serum tube (gel barrier), K2 EDTA plasma, and lithium
heparin plasma. In the study, 50 donor matched venous specimens of the aforementioned
were collected. Each specimen was tested in singlicate using one lot of the reagent kit and
one instrument, and the results compared to the mean of singlicate serum measurements. The
results were analyzed by Passing-Bablok linear regression with the concentration from each
donor’s evaluation tube (y-axis) versus the mean concentration of the serum results (x-axis).

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data:
Clinical studies were performed in the emergency department and in outpatient settings.
Emergency Department (ED)
A clinical study across 30 sites in the United States was conducted to establish the clinical
performance characteristics of the ADVIA Centaur NT-proBNPII (PBNPII) run on the
ADVIA Centaur XP system. In the study, subjects 22 years and older presenting with signs
and symptoms that raise clinical suspicion of heart failure (HF), such as dyspnea, that were
not related to trauma, were enrolled. For each patient enrollment, a serum sample was
collected for determination of their NT-proBNP concentration. Data supporting the stability
of the samples for the storage time and condition were provided by the sponsor. A diagnosis
of whether or not acute HF for each subject was assessed by an independent, central
adjudication panel. Individuals in the population were African American (45.8%) and white
(50.1%), with the remaining 4.2% represented by other races.
From the 3128 subjects enrolled in the study, a total of 1148 subjects were adjudicated as
acute HF and 1980 subjects were adjudicated as without acute HF.

The pretest probability of HF (prevalence of HF in the study), posttest probabilities,
likelihood ratios and the two-tailed 95% CIs of the test result versus adjudicated diagnosis
were determined using the age-dependent positive cut-offs (450 pg/mL for subjects 22–<50
years old; 900 pg/mL for subjects 50–<75 years old; 1800 pg/mL for subjects ≥75 years old)

The sponsor included the following statements in their instructions for use concerning the
performance of their device in ED settings in certain clinical subgroups:
• Patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 had a higher rate of false negatives compared to those patients
with BMI <30 kg/m2. Of the total false negatives (44/1148), 41 (93%) came from patients with
BMI ≥30 kg/m2, 1 (2.2%) came from a patient with a BMI <30 kg/m2, and 2 (4.4%) were from
patients with unknown BMI.
• Patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 had a higher rate of false positives compared to those
patients with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2. Of the 492 total patients with eGFR <60
mL/min/1.73m2 adjudicated as no acute HF, 226 (45.9%) had PBNPII concentrations ≥ ASC. Of

the 1427 total patients with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 adjudicated as no acute HF, 251 (17.6%)
had PBNPII concentrations ≥ ASC. Sixty-one (61) patients adjudicated as no acute HF (3.1%),
had unknown eGFR.
• Patients with a history of HF had a higher rate of false positives compared to those patients
with no history of HF. Of the 527 total patients with a history of HF adjudicated as no acute HF,
243 (46.1%) had PBNPII concentrations ≥ ASC. Of the 1338 total patients with no history of HF
adjudicated as no acute HF, 216 (16.1%) had PBNPII concentrations ≥ ASC. Of the 1980
patients adjudicated as no acute HF, 115 (5.8%) had unknown history of HF.
Variation in NT-proBNP concentrations due to high BMI, low GFR, and history of HF are
extensively discussed in published literature on Natriuretic Peptides.
Outpatient (OP)
A clinical study across 28 OP sites in the United States was conducted to establish the clinical
performance characteristics of the ADVIA Centaur® NT-proBNPII (PBNPII) run on the ADVIA
Centaur XP system. In the study, subjects 22 years and older presenting with signs and
symptoms that raise clinical suspicion of heart failure (HF), such as dyspnea, that were not
related to trauma, were enrolled in the study. For each patient, a serum sample was collected for
determination of their NT-proBNP concentration. Data supporting the stability of the samples
for the storage time and condition were provided by the sponsor. A diagnosis of new onset of HF
or not was assessed by an independent, central adjudication panel. Individuals in the population
were African American (19.7%) and white (78.4%), with the remaining 1.8% represented by
other races. The clinical performance of the device using cutoff of 125 pg/mL was evaluated.
From the 1033 subjects enrolled in the study, a total of 185 subjects were adjudicated as new
onset HF and 848 subjects were adjudicated as without HF. The clinical performance of the
device is summarized below:

D Clinical Cut-Off:
The sponsor describes the following cut-offs for patients presenting to ED settings where HF is
suspected:
Age Group (Years) PBNPII Results (pg/mL) Interpretation
All <300 Negative: Heart Failure Unlikely
<50 ≥ 300 - ≤ 450
Gray Zone: Result Indeterminate – Consider
50-75 ≥ 300 - ≤ 900
other reasons for NT-proBNP elevation
>75 ≥ 300 - ≤ 1800
<50 > 450
50-75 > 900 Positive: Heart Failure Likely
>75 > 1800
For patients presenting to outpatient facilities where HF is suspected (but has not been previously
diagnosed), the following cut-off is described:
Age Group (Years) PBNPII Results (pg/mL) Interpretation
All < 125 Negative: Heart Failure Unlikely
All ≥ 125 Positive: Heart Failure Likely
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The expected values of NT-proBNP in healthy adults was establish in a study conducted in
accordance with CLSI EP28-A3c.
In the study, serum levels of NT-proBNP were assayed with the ADVIA Centaur® NT-
proBNPII (PBNPII) on a total of 723 apparently healthy subjects (362 females and 361 males)
without HF. These apparently healthy subjects were self-reported without heart failure or
disease. The results were subgrouped by gender, with each group of females and males was
stratified into three age groups of: < 50 years, 50–75 years, and > 75 years. The data was
analyzed by a non-parametric method and summarized as follows.
