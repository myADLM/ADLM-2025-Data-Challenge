IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The cobas® pulse blood glucose monitoring system consists of a hand-held, battery powered
cobas® pulse instrument, single use cobas® GLU test strips, instrument charging station, quick
start guide and user guide for CLIA waived users as well as cobas® GLU test strip insert and
user assistance guide for non-CLIA waived users. The cobas GLU Linearity Kit and GLU QC
kit are sold separately.
B Principle of Operation:
The detection chemistry used by the cobas® pulse blood glucose monitoring system for the
blood glucose result is FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH). When the blood is
applied to the test strip, the blood induces a chemical reaction which produces a current that is
transmitted through the electrodes to the instrument. The magnitude of the resultant current is
proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. The detected current signal is then
calculated by the meter and the glucose concentration is then displayed on the meter. The meter
reports plasma equivalent glucose concentrations.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
cobas pulse® instrument
2. Specimen Identification:
Arterial whole blood, neonatal arterial whole blood, and neonatal heel stick whole blood
anticoagulated with lithium heparin can be used with this test system. The meter contains a
laser barcode scanner that allows for scanning patient identification information that may
also be entered manually. The meter prompts the user to choose from a dropdown menu of
sample types prior to testing.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
All samples must be tested immediately upon collection.
4. Calibration:
The system does not require calibration by the end-user. When the test strip is inserted into
the instrument, the instrument reads the lot information from the strip that includes the
calibration and expiration information for that test strip lot.
5. Quality Control:
The cobas® GLU QC kit control solutions are aqueous solutions available at two different
glucose levels (Level 1 and Level 2). Instructions on when to perform quality control testing
K220272 - Page 3 of 20

--- Page 4 ---
using both levels are included in the labeling. If the quality control testing using both QC
levels is not performed when required as described in the labeling, the user is cautioned that a
QC lockout is implemented and blood glucose cannot be tested until the QC tests are run
successfully. The meter displays a pass or fail result once both QC tests are performed. The
acceptable ranges are communicated to the meter by the user scanning the barcode on the QC
bottle. The user is cautioned not to use the meter and to contact the system administrator if
the quality control test fails after repeating the QC test.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision evaluations were conducted to evaluate repeatability (within-run precision) and
intermediate precision of the cobas pulse blood glucose monitoring system according to
CLSI guideline EP05-A3 as well as the FDA Guidance document: Blood Glucose
Monitoring Test Systems for Prescription Point-of-Care Use (issued September 29, 2020).
Within-run Precision
Within-run precision was evaluated using whole blood samples adjusted (spiked or allowed
to glycolyze) to achieve five glucose concentration ranges (30-50 mg/dL, 51-110 mg/dL,
111-150 mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, and 251-400 mg/dL). Each glucose level was tested with
three lots of cobas GLU test strips in replicates of 10 on 10 cobas pulse instruments for a
total of 300 results per glucose level. The summary of within-run precision results are
presented in the table below:

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the cobas pulse blood glucose monitoring system was evaluated using whole
blood samples with 11 glucose concentrations between 8-720 mg/dL. Each sample was
tested using three lots of cobas GLU test strips and results were compared to those obtained
using the comparator method (the cobas 6000 system). The results from the regression
analysis are summarized below:
Lot Linear Regression Equation R2
1 y =1.01x +3.99 1.00
2 y =1.01x -4.10 1.00
3 y =1.03x -4.55 1.00
The results of the study support that the test system is linear from 10 – 600 mg/dL glucose.
If the concentration of a sample is less than 10 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the
meter as “Lo”. If a sample exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as
“Hi”. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference testing was conducted to evaluate the effect of common endogenous and
exogenous substances expected in the intended use population on the cobas pulse blood
glucose monitoring system. Additional potential interferents were included in the testing
following a detailed analysis of medications and medical conditions of the subjects evaluated
in the method comparison study (please see the tables in Section VII.C.3 below for a detailed
list of medications and conditions).
Whole blood samples were adjusted to achieve three glucose concentration ranges: 50-70
mg/dL, 110-130 mg/dL, 225-270 mg/dL. Each of these samples was divided into a test pool
with the potential interferent added and a control sample with no added interferent. Results
from the test samples on the candidate meter were compared to results obtained from the
control sample on the candidate meter using three test strip lots. The % difference between
the test sample and the control sample was calculated using the mean of 10 replicates. The
highest tested concentrations at which no significant interference was observed (defined by
the sponsor as less than ±10% bias between the test and control samples) are presented in the
following table:

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range is 10 - 600 mg/dL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
Each measurement result is traceable to the NIST SRM 917 glucose reference material. A
method comparison was performed using the candidate device and the cobas 6000 system as
the comparator method (see section VII.C.3 below).
Test Strip Stability
Test strip stability was assessed using real time stability studies. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the labeling claims of a 24
month closed vial shelf life and open vial use life when stored at 4 - 30°C (39 - 86°F) and
relative humidity of 10-90%. The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
The performance of the cobas pulse glucose monitoring system was assessed in professional
healthcare settings using lithium heparin arterial samples from 622 patients (adult, pediatric
and neonate that included neonate arterial samples from 104 patients) and neonate heel stick
samples from 147 neonates for a total of 873 patients. The study was conducted at 14
clinical sites that included patients from the general ward, operating rooms, medical intensive
care units, surgical intensive care units, pediatric intensive care units, neonatal intensive care
units and nurseries. Results from the cobas pulse glucose monitoring system were obtained
by a total of 75 untrained operators who were also untrained in the use of the cobas pulse
glucose monitoring system.
Samples from patients, less than 24 hours old to over 81 years of age, were analyzed using a
total of 3 different test strip lots throughout the study. The glucose levels of the patient
samples were as follows (according to the comparator method; the cobas 6000 system): 49.0
to 461.9 mg/L for all arterial (24 samples <80 mg/dL and 10 samples >300 mg/dL); 49.0 to
461.9 mg/L (16 samples <80 mg/dL and 4 samples >300mg/dL) for neonate arterial; 18.5
mg/dL to 176.8 mg/dL (85 samples <80 mg/dL) for neonatal heelstick. In addition to glucose
levels, patient conditions, medication information, pO2, sodium, and hematocrit levels were
collected during the study. The study included 1617 unique patient conditions receiving a
total of 709 medications representing 77 parent drug classes (see patient conditions and
medication tables below).
The results of the cobas pulse glucose monitoring system were compared with those obtained
on the comparator method (cobas 6000 system) and are as follows for each specimen type
(all arterial combined, neonate arterial, and neonate heel stick):

Usability Assessment/Operator Questionnaire
Upon completion of the clinical studies, operators completed a questionnaire to evaluate the
ease of understanding of the test procedure. The participants found the cobas pulse glucose
monitoring system easy to use and the instructions in the user manual and QRG clear and
easy to follow.
A readability assessment demonstrated that the quick reference guide (QRG) and the
instructions for the CLIA waived user in the user manual were written at a 7th grade reading
level.

Accuracy at extreme glucose concentrations
An additional study was conducted to further assess the performance of the cobas pulse blood
glucose monitoring system at the extreme upper and lower ends of the claimed measuring range.
The study was performed using whole blood samples altered to achieve glucose concentrations
of less than 80 mg/dL (52 samples) and greater than 300 mg/dL (52 samples). Samples were
tested on the cobas pulse instrument by intended use operators using test strips from 3 lots and
results compared to the results obtained on the comparator method (cobas 6000 system). The
results are summarized below:

Accuracy in samples representative of neonate samples
An additional study was performed using adult whole blood samples altered to achieve glucose
concentrations between 10 and 50 mg/dL and adjusted to two levels of hematocrit at 40% and
65%, in order to simulate the hematocrit levels of neonatal blood. A total of 94 distinct samples
were used for the study (48 samples at 40% hematocrit and 46 samples at 65% hematocrit).
Samples were tested on the cobas pulse meter by intended use operators using test strips from 3
lots and results were compared to the results obtained on the comparator method (cobas 6000
system). The results are summarized below:

Capillary Fingerstick and Venous Whole Blood Limitations
The sponsor includes limitations against the use of the cobas pulse with capillary finger stick and
venous whole blood. The labeling states the following:
• In comparing capillary whole blood glucose measurements using the cobas® pulse to
venous plasma measurements using the comparator method, a large percentage of
samples had significant bias to the comparator method.
• In comparing venous whole blood on the cobas® pulse to venous plasma on the
comparator method for samples with glucose less than 75 mg/dL, 2 outliers showed
significant bias to the comparator method, and protocol deviations led to a large number
of venous sample exclusions resulting in uncertainty in the study.
These limitations were put in place due to risks posed by the performance of this device in these
two sample types. The results of the cobas pulse glucose monitoring system were compared with
those obtained on the comparator method and are as follows for each specimen type:
For capillary fingerstick samples, 54.5% (12/22) of samples with glucose concentrations <75
mg/dL were within ±12 mg/dL and 45.5% (10/22) exceeded a difference of ±15 mg/dL
relative to the comparator method result. Additionally, for capillary fingerstick samples with
glucose concentrations ≥75 mg/dL, 82.2% (562/684) of the samples were within ±12 mg/dL
and 7.0% (48/684) exceeded a difference of ±20% relative to the comparator method results.
For venous whole blood samples, 94.6% (35/37) of samples with glucose concentrations <75
mg/dL were within ±12 mg/dL and 5.4% (2/37) exceeded a difference of ±15 mg/dL relative
to the comparator method result. Additionally, protocol deviations led to the exclusion of
more than 10% of venous whole blood samples from the study resulting in uncertainty in the
results from this study.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Oxygen Study:
The impact of oxygen partial pressure (pO2) in blood on measurements with the cobas pulse
blood glucose monitoring system was evaluated using whole blood samples adjusted to three
concentration levels of glucose (target ranges 50 - 70 mg/dL, 110 - 130 mg/dL and 225 - 270
mg/dL). Each glucose range was tested at four pO2 levels of about 30, 60, 90, and 200 mm
Hg. The values were compared with the glucose measurements obtained from the comparator
method (cobas 6000 system). The results of the study demonstrate that pO2 does not
significantly impact the results.
2. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the cobas pulse blood glucose monitoring system
was evaluated using whole blood samples adjusted to hematocrit levels in 5% intervals in the
range from 5 to 70% and at 5 glucose concentrations (30-50 mg/dL, 51-110 mg/dL, 111-150
mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, 251-400 mg/dL). The results were compared to those obtained from
the comparator method (cobas 6000 system). The results of the study support the labeled
hematocrit claimed range of 5-70%.
3. Cleaning and Disinfection:
The device is intended for multiple-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed
on the exterior meter materials by an outside commercial testing laboratory, demonstrating
complete inactivation of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectants, Clorox
Germicidal Wipes (EPA registration # 67619-12) and Super Sani-Cloth Germicidal
Disposable Wipe (EPA registration # 9480-4). Robustness studies were also performed by
the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or in the external
materials of the meter after 12,045 cleaning and disinfection cycles using each of the chosen
disinfectants. The robustness studies were designed to simulate cleaning and disinfection
over the 3-year multiple-patient use life of the meter. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
4. System Operating Conditions Testing:
To assess the performance of the cobas pulse glucose monitoring system when used under
various operating temperature and humidity conditions, the system was tested at different
temperature and relative humidity (RH) conditions including 10°C/45%RH, 42°C/45% RH,
12°C/10%RH, 12°C/90%RH, 30°C/90%RH and 40°C/10%RH. Each condition was tested

using whole blood at five blood glucose concentrations (30-50 mg/dL, 51-110 mg/dL, 111-
150 mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, 251-400 mg/dL). The results from the cobas pulse blood
glucose monitoring system under each test condition were compared to nominal control
conditions. The study results support the labeled operating conditions claim of 12°C to 40°C
(54 to 104 °F) and relative humidity range of 10% to 90%.
5. Altitude Study:
To assess the effect of altitude on the performance of the cobas pulse glucose monitoring
system, the system was tested at an altitude of about 15,420 ft (4,700 meters) above sea level.
Whole blood samples adjusted to 3 glucose concentrations (50-65 mg/dL, 100-120 mg/dL,
and 200-250 mg/dL) were tested. The results obtained from the candidate system at 15,420
ft were compared to those obtained at an altitude of 295 ft (90 meters) above sea level. The
results of the study support the claim that the cobas pulse glucose monitoring system can be
operated at altitudes of up to 15,420 ft (4,700 meters).
6. Sample Volume Study:
The sponsor conducted a sample volume study using whole blood samples at 3 glucose
concentrations (50-65, 100-120 and 200-250 mg/dL) tested at 5 sample volumes (0.2, 0.4,
0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 μL). Values obtained using the candidate system were compared to those
obtained using the comparator method (cobas 6000 system). Results support the claimed
minimum sample volume of 0.6 μL for the cobas pulse glucose monitoring system. The
meter has an error message displayed if enough blood is not added to the test strip. This
feature was validated and was shown to function as intended.
7. Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed and the system was found
to be compliant.
8. Flex Studies:
Intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, drop testing, testing with used test strips, quality
control lockout, transport, and vibration testing was completed by the sponsor. The testing
performed demonstrated that the cobas pulse glucose monitoring system is robust to these
expected use scenarios.
9. Test Strip Lot Release Protocol:
The test strip lot release protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
