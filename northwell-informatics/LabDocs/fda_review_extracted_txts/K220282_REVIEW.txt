D Special Instrument Requirements:
i-STAT 1 analyzer (K001387)
i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer (K103195)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT 1 System consists of the i-STAT 1 analyzer and the i-STAT cartridges. The i-STAT
PTplus cartridge is a coagulation cartridge for determining the time required for complete
activation of the extrinsic coagulation cascade. The cartridge contains electrochemical sensors
and test reagents that must be mixed with the sample. The reagents include the reactive
ingredient to activate the coagulation cascade as well as electrochemical markers that generate a
sensor signal when the cascade is fully activated.
The analysis time of the i-STAT PTplus cartridge is up to 300 seconds or 5 minutes. The sample
volume required for the i-STAT PTplus cartridge is approximately 20 μl of whole blood (venous
or capillary) without added anticoagulant. The i-STAT PTplus cartridge is a single-use disposable
unit that is self-contained. The test reagents and sample fluids do not contact the instrument or
user. All the test steps and fluid movements occur within the cartridge.
Other components of the i-STAT 1 System are the Electronic Simulator, the i-STAT 1
Downloader/Recharger and the i-STAT Printer. The i-STAT 1 analyzer is a handheld, in vitro
diagnostic analytical device designed to run only i-STAT test cartridges. The system is designed
for use by trained medical professionals at the patient point of care or in the clinical laboratory
and is for prescription use only. The i-STAT 1 System has an internal quality control (internal
simulator) and an external quality control (Electronic Simulator). The internal and external
simulators are used to check the instrument signal-reading function. In addition to the quality
controls within the i-STAT 1 System, liquid quality controls are available as an optional quality
control methodology to meet the regulatory compliance requirements applicable to the facility
where they are to be used.
The liquid quality controls are the i-STAT PTplus Control Levels 1 and 2 and can be used for the
quality control of the i-STAT PTplus cartridge. The coagulation controls consist of lyophilized
citrated human plasma and calcium chloride fluid for reconstitution. i-STAT PTplus Control Level
1 has been formulated to produce a normal prothrombin time. Level 2 has been formulated to
produce an extended prothrombin time. Each level of control is packaged as a box of 5 vials
K220282 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
containing 1 mL of lyophilized citrated human plasma and 5 vials of 1.5 mL of calcium chloride
diluent.
The i-STAT PTplus controls are intended for use with the i-STAT PT plus cartridge on the i-STAT
System, and values assigned to these controls may not be commutable with other commercial
methods.
B Principle of Operation:
The i-STAT PTplus cartridge with the i-STAT 1 Analyzer uses electrochemical technology with
amperometric (electric current) detection of thrombin activity to generate a clot time. The
prothrombin time test result is reported as an International Normalized Ratio (INR) and/or in
seconds.
In a prothrombin time test, coagulation is initiated by exposing the sample to tissue
thromboplastin. In the i-STAT Prothrombin time test, complete activation is indicated when
activated thrombin converts a thrombin substrate to fibrin and extensive or localized clots are
detected by an electrochemical sensor.

f. Whole Blood Precision Study
Whole blood precision (repeatability) was evaluated using venous and capillary specimens at
three ranges: non-therapeutic (INR 0.8 – 1.9), therapeutic (INR 2.0 ‒ 4.5), and very high
therapeutic (INR 4.6 - 8.0). The repeatability analysis was conducted using the data collected
across three point of care sites from duplicate testing in both the capillary and the venous
method comparison studies. The mean, pooled standard deviation, %CV and their respective
95% confidence intervals (CI) for PT in seconds and INR were calculated for each subject
level. The table below summarize this data for all sites combined. All results met the
acceptance criteria.

The interference performance of the prothrombin time test in the i-STAT PTplus cartridge
with the i-STAT 1 System was evaluated in the presence of potentially interfering
endogenous or exogenous substances. The effect of each substance at each prothrombin
time level (normal and therapeutic) was evaluated by comparing the performance of a test
sample spiked to a high concentration of the substance and a control sample spiked with
an equal volume of solvent. For an identified interferent, a dose-response was performed
to determine the degree of interference as a function of the substance concentration. The
common exogenous and endogenous interfering substances and their interference results
are listed below and showed no significant interference up to the indicated concentration
for all samples tested.
Maximum Test Concentration

Ibuprofen 2425 µmol/L
Prasugrel 265.5 ng/mL
Tranexamic Acid 45 µg/mL
Triglycerides 37 mmol/L
Uric Acid 1.4 mmol/L
For the identified PT test interferents chlorhexidine digluconate, daptomycin, and
oritavancin, a dose-response experiment was performed.
Substance Interference Result
Chlorhexidine digluconate Prolonged results ≥ 9.58x10-4 %
Daptomycin Prolonged results ≥ 0.22 mg/mL
Oritavancin Prolonged results ≥ 104 mg/L
b. Factor Sensitivity
The factor sensitivity for factors FII, FV, FVII and FX was determined using samples
prepared by proportionately combining pooled normal plasma, red blood cells and factor-
deficient plasma with various percent (%) factor activity ranging from 20%–100%. Each
factor was tested at eight factor activity levels with three cartridge lots and three
replicates per lot on nine i-STAT 1 analyzers. The factor sensitivity for the i-STAT PTplus
test was estimated to be FII (39.5%); FV (42.0%); FVII (21.5%); FX (22.0%).
c. Fibrinogen Sensitivity
Fibrinogen sensitivity was evaluated using one cartridge lot across five fibrinogen levels,
63, 80, 336, 599, and 702 mg/dL. The study demonstrated that the prothrombin time test

in the i-STAT PTplus cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System is insensitive to fibrinogen
across a concentration range of 63–702 mg/dL.
d. Platelet Sensitivity
Platelet sensitivity was evaluated at three platelet levels (low, normal, and high). The
study demonstrated that the prothrombin time test in the i-STAT PTplus cartridge with the
i-STAT 1 System is insensitive to platelets in the range of 70,000–670,000/mm3.
e. Hematocrit Sensitivity
The hematocrit sensitivity was evaluated by comparing the low hematocrit level (~23%
packed-cell volume (PCV)) and the high hematocrit level (~55% PCV) to the nominal
hematocrit level (~39% PCV) using three lots of i-STAT PTplus cartridges. The results of
the internal study demonstrate that the prothrombin test time in the i-STAT PTplus
cartridge on the i-STAT 1 System is insensitive to hematocrit between 24 to 54% PCV.
f. Heparin Sensitivity
Sensitivity to unfractionated heparin was evaluated at two heparin levels. The study
demonstrated that the prothrombin time test in the i-STAT PTplus cartridge with the i-
STAT 1 System is insensitive to unfractionated heparin concentrations up to 1.0 IU/mL.
g. Sensitivity for Lupus Anticoagulant
Sensitivity to lupus anticoagulant antibodies (LA) was evaluated using two levels (low
and high) of positive LA and one level of negative LA (control). The study demonstrated
that the prothrombin time test in the i-STAT PTplus cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System is
sensitive to both low and high levels of lupus anticoagulant antibodies.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range of the prothrombin time test in the i-STAT PTplus cartridge with the i-
STAT 1 System was determined through a method comparison study by using venous and
capillary whole blood specimens collected from subjects undergoing anticoagulant therapy
with coumarin derivatives and from subjects who were not on anticoagulant therapy. The
reportable range for prothrombin time test in the i-STAT PTplus cartridge with the i-STAT 1
System is 0.8–8.0 INR and 8.1–80.8 seconds.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The traceability of the prothrombin time test in the i-STAT PTplus has been established
against the World Health Organization (WHO) International Reference Preparation (IRP) of
human recombinant tissue factor (RTF) using the tilt tube technique. The i-STAT PTplus
cartridge is traceable to rTF/16.
Calibration
The i-STAT PTplus thromboplastin is specific for the i-STAT instrument. Calibration and ISI
assignment is performed using multiple i-STAT instruments running i-STAT cartridges
containing the i-STAT PTplus thromboplastin resulting in a factory calibrated PT test.
K220282 - Page 10 of 13

Controls
Liquid quality controls (i-STAT PTplus Control Levels 1 and 2) are available as an optional
quality control methodology to meet facility regulatory compliance requirements. The
controls are citrated pooled lyophilized plasma with a calcium chloride (CaCl ) reconstitution
2
solution. i-STAT PTplus Control Level 1 has been formulated to produce a normal/non-
therapeutic prothrombin time and is designed to provide results within a range of 0.8–1.6
INR, while i-STAT PTplus Control Level 2 has been formulated to produce a therapeutic
prothrombin time and is designed to provide results within a range of 1.7–3.5 INR. The
controls are manufactured for Abbott Point of Care by Cliniqa Corporation.
In-Use (Reconstituted) Stability Study for Controls
The instructions for use for the i-STAT PTplus Controls specify that the control fluid
components be equilibrated at room temperature for a minimum of 45 minutes to a maximum
of 4 hours prior to reconstitution. The user is instructed to test the fluids immediately after
reconstitution. The in-use stability of the controls was assessed by testing of i-STAT PTplus
cartridges with of i-STAT PTplus Controls stored at room temperature over the range of the
equilibration period specified above. An in-use stability study was conducted using nine vials
from one lot of i-STAT PTplus Control Levels 1 and 2 on i-STAT PTplus cartridge lot using 60
i-STAT 1 analyzers. At each time interval, three vials of each fluid level were tested with 20
i-STAT PTplus/aPTT cartridges per vial on i-STAT 1 analyzers for a total sample size of 60
cartridges per test condition per fluid level. The results for the in-use stability study for the i-
STAT PTplus Controls support that the controls are stable for four hours when stored at room
temperature.
Shelf-Life Stability Study for Controls
A real-time shelf-life stability study was conducted using three lots for each level of i-STAT
PTplus Control Levels 1 and 2 with seven i-STAT PTplus cartridge lots using six i-STAT 1
analyzers. Testing was performed at the beginning of the study (T= 0, corresponding to date
of control lot manufacture), at three intervals throughout the duration of the intended shelf
life and two intervals beyond the intended shelf life for a total of six test time points. The
results for the real time stability study for the i-STAT PTplus Controls support a shelf-life of
12 months when stored refrigerated at 2–8°C.
i-STAT PTplus Cartridge Shelf-Life
Shelf-life stability study was conducted using three lots of i-STAT PTplus cartridges at 2-8℃
and 18-30℃ storage conditions. Three levels of the i-STAT PTplus control fluids, unaltered
whole blood at normal prothrombin time and factor depleted samples to reflect therapeutic
prothrombin times were tested at seven different test events: 0, 19, 60, 90, 120, 180, 210, and
240 days.
The stability results for the prothrombin time test in the i-STAT PTplus cartridge on the i-
STAT 1 System support a shelf-life claim of 193 days (6 months) at 2-8°C and 14 days at 18-
30°C.
