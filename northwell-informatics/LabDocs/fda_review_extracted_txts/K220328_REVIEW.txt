III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The EasyStat 300 is designed for clinical laboratory use, making quantitative measurements of
Glucose (Glu) and Hematocrit % (Hct) in whole blood (arterial/venous) samples from Li-
Heparinized Syringes or Capillary Tubes. This analyzer should only be used by trained
technicians in clinical laboratories to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with
metabolite disturbances.
Glucose (Glu) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism
disorders including diabetes mellitus, idiopathic hypoglycemia, and pancreatic inlet cell
carcinoma.
Hematocrit (Hct) measurements are used to measure red cell volume in blood. Abnormal states
include anemia and erythrocytosis.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
EasyStat 300 Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description
The candidate device is a small bench-top analyzer for use by health care professionals. The
analyzer incorporates a replaceable EasyStat 300 ISE cartridge that is comprised of sensors for
measurement of glucose (Glu) and hematocrit (Hct). The analyzer draws 175μL of human
lithium heparinized venous or arterial whole blood samples when operated in syringe mode, and
100μL of human lithium heparinized venous or arterial whole blood samples when operated in
capillary mode.
The analyzer incorporates a replaceable reagent module containing calibrating solutions (A2, B2,
and C2) for the sensors. The reagent module contains encoded reagent information (calibration
values and expiration date) which is read by the analyzer upon installation of the reagent module.
Calibrations are performed automatically or on-demand by the user.
The EasyStat 300 Analyzer was also cleared for making quantitative measurements of pO2
(partial pressure of oxygen), pCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), and pH (hydrogen ion

activity) in K211559 and K+ (potassium), Ca++ (ionized calcium), and Cl- (Chloride) in
K220396.
B Principle of Operation:
The EasyStat 300 uses biosensors incorporated in the Glu-Hct sensor cartridge for the
measurement of glucose and hematocrit in patient’s blood samples.
Glucose is measured amperometrically on the cartridge using electrodes that measure the change
in current at the sensor surface. The sensor uses glucose oxidase to produce hydrogen peroxide
(H O ), and the electrons generated in the oxidation process produce an electrical current that is
2 2
proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample.
Hematocrit is quantified by measuring the electrical impedance of a blood sample following
calibration of the Hct sensor using two standard solutions. The Hct concentration obtained is
corrected for the concentration of sodium ions.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The Precision of the EasyStat 300 was evaluated in two studies: a single-site, 20-day study
using aqueous QC material and a multi-site, 5-day study using venous whole blood from
donors. Each study was performed in both Syringe and Capillary mode.
Single-Site Study – 20-day with aqueous QC material
Three levels of aqueous QC material were assayed for Glucose and two levels of aqueous QC
material were assayed for Hematocrit. Testing was performed using three EasyStat 300
analyzers and a single lot of cartridges. Each sample was measured in duplicate per run with
two runs per day over twenty non-consecutive days, resulting in a total of 80 measurements

Multi-Site Study – 5-day with venous whole blood
Three levels of venous whole blood were assayed for both Glucose and Hematocrit. Testing
was performed by using three EasyStat 300 analyzers and three cartridge lots (one per
instrument). Each sample was measured with five replicates per run, with one run per day
over five consecutive days, resulting in a total of 25 measurements per level on each
instrument. Data collected from each of the three analyzers were evaluated for Repeatability
(Within-Run precision) and Within Laboratory precision. The results from one representative

2. Linearity:
The linearity study was conducted using 9 samples covering the measuring range assayed in
triplicate on each of three EasyStat 300 analyzers. The study was conducted in both syringe
mode and capillary mode, using one lot of cartridges over one day. Native lithium heparin
venous whole blood samples were spiked with D-glucose (for Glu) or packed red blood cells
(for Hct) or diluted with plasma from the same donor. Regression analysis confirmed first
order linearity for both glucose and hematocrit within the specified reportable ranges. The
maximum % deviation from linearity noted was 9.1%. The summary analysis is included in

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference with endogenous and exogenous substance was evaluated using lithium heparin
venous whole blood samples. Two levels of Glu (ranging from 26.4 to 346.4 mg/dL) and two
levels of Hct (ranging from 18.2% to 48.4%) were tested with and without the potential
interfering substances.
Bias was calculated as the difference between the average value with interferent and the
average value without interferent. Interferents identified with a bias less than the total
allowable error (TAE) were listed as non-interfering while those with bias greater than the
TAE were listed with their calculated % bias.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
See section VII A.2, Linearity.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Glucose is traceable to NIST SRM-917c. Hct traceability is performed using internally
produced reference standards and is calculated using conductivity measurements.
6. Detection Limit:
LoB/LoD
For Glucose, the Limit of Blank (LoB) was evaluated using five pooled plasma samples.
Once LoB was established, LoD was evaluated by spiking glucose into the plasma samples.
For Hematocrit, the LoB was evaluated using five pooled plasma samples that were prepared
through centrifugation of blood samples. Once LoB was established, LoD was evaluated by
spiking a small number of red blood cells into the plasma samples.
All studies were performed in both syringe and capillary mode and carried out on a single
instrument with two reagent lots over three consecutive days. Five samples were run with
four replicates per reagent lot, resulting in a total of 60 blank replicates per lot for LoB and
60 low level replicates per lot for LoD.

LoQ
For Glucose, the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined using four pooled plasma
samples created by using ultrafiltration until the glucose concentrations were sufficiently
low. The ultrafiltered plasma was then spiked with concentrated glucose to achieve glucose
levels slightly above the LoD. Values were determined by first measuring on a RapidPoint
500 device.
For Hematocrit, the LoQ was determined using four pooled plasma samples that were
prepared through centrifugation of blood samples. A small number of red blood cells were
then spiked into the plasma to increase hematocrit level to slightly above the LoD. Values
were determined by first measuring on an EasyStat pH, pCO , pO , Hct, NA+, K+, CA++
2 2
analyzer and then diluting the sample with plasma from the same donor.
Studies were performed in both syringe and capillary modes and carried out on a single
instrument with two reagent lots over three consecutive days. Each day, the four samples
were run with three replicates per reagent lot, resulting in a total of 36 low level sample
replicates per lot.
The Detection Limit results are summarized in the tables below:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The Method Comparison study was conducted using lithium heparin venous and arterial
whole blood collected from subjects across two sites. For Glucose, 243 unique samples were
analyzed on both an EasyStat 300 candidate device and a Rapidpoint 500 predicate device.
For Hematocrit, up to 198 unique samples were analyzed on both an EasyStat 300 candidate
device and an EasyStat predicate device. Many of these samples were used to evaluate both
Glu and Hct.
