B Indication(s) for Use:
SmartAdjust™ technology is intended for use with compatible integrated continuous glucose
monitors (iCGM) and alternate controller enabled (ACE) pumps to automatically increase,
decrease, and pause delivery of insulin based on current and predicted glucose values.
SmartAdjust™ technology is intended for the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in persons
2 years of age and older. SmartAdjust™ technology is intended for single patient use and
requires a prescription.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
SmartAdjust™ technology should not be used by anyone under the age of 2 years old.
SmartAdjust™ technology should also NOT be used in people who require less than 5 units of
insulin per day as the safety of the technology has not been evaluated in this population.
Do not use SmartAdjust™ technology in pregnant women, critically ill patients, and those on
dialysis. The safety of the SmartAdjust™ technology has not been evaluated in these
populations.
Do not use SmartAdjust™ technology if you are taking hydroxyurea as it could lead to falsely
elevated CGM values and result in over-delivery of insulin that can lead to severe hypoglycemia.
Do not use SmartAdjust™ technology if you do NOT have adequate hearing and/or vision to
allow recognition of all functions of the Omnipod 5 System, including alerts, alarms, and
reminders.
SmartAdjust™ technology used with the Omnipod 5 System is designed to use rapid-acting U-
100 insulins. The following U-100 rapid-acting insulin analogs have been tested and found to be
safe for use in the Pod: NovoLog® (insulin aspart), Humalog® (insulin lispro), and Admelog®
(insulin lispro) for use up to 72 hours (3 days). Before using a different insulin with the Omnipod
5 System, check the insulin drug label and consult your healthcare provider. Refer to the insulin
labeling and follow your healthcare provider’s directions for how often to replace the Pod.
SmartAdjust™ technology used with the Omnipod 5 System relies on accurate, current CGM
values to determine your insulin needs. Always make sure you are using the CGM per
manufacturer's instructions and do not extend the sensor wear beyond the recommended
duration.
Do NOT attempt to use the SmartAdjust™ technology with the Omnipod 5 System before you
receive training. Inadequate training could put your health and safety at risk.
Device components used with the SmartAdjust™ technology including the pod, CGM
transmitter, and CGM sensor must be removed before Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
Computed Tomoraphy (CT) scan, or diathermy treatment. In addition, the SmartAdjust™
K220394 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
Controller and smartphone should be placed outside of the precedure room. Exposure to MRI,
CT, or diathery treatment can damage the components.
At the time of device authorization, the compatible integrated continuous glucose monitor
(iCGM) is the Dexcom G6 iCGM.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
SmartAdjust™ technology (the Omnipod 5 interoperable automated glycemic controller, or
iAGC) is a software-only medical device intended for the management of type 1 diabetes
mellitus. The Omnipod 5 iAGC uses data from a connected iCGM along with user-defined
parameters to predict future glucose trends and automatically increase, decrease, or pause the
delivery of insulin via a compatible alternate controller enabled (ACE) pump.
The SmartAdjust™ technology software is part of the Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery
System, which also includes the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump (K203768), Omnipod 5 Bolus
Calculator (K203772), and an integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM, Dexcom G6, most
recently cleared under K201328). The SmartAdjust™ technology is intended to be digitally
connected to an iCGM and an ACE Pump.
The SmartAdjust™ technology software resides on the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump (the Omnipod 5
Pod and Omnipod 5 App). The iAGC software is responsible for controlling insulin delivery via
compatible ACE Pump when the system is in Automated Mode. iCGM data is transmitted from
the iCGM to the ACE Pump via Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The SmartAdjust™
Technology uses this transmitted iCGM data in its calculations. The SmartAdjust™ technology
can be turned off, and the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump will operate in Manual Mode, which delivers
insulin based on healthcare provider (HCP) or user-defined basal programs.
The SmartAdjust™ technology has three states of operation: Automated Mode, Automated:
Limited, and Activity. In Automated Mode, the system calculates insulin delivery every 5
minutes based on the user-customizable glucose target (110–150 mg/dL). Automated: Limited is
enabled when the SmartAdjust™ technology is not receiving data from a connected iCGM for 20
minutes or more and during sensor warm-up. While in Automated: Limited, the user will receive
no more than pre-programmed basal insulin. When a valid glucose value is received from the
iCGM, the SmartAdjust™ technology will resume delivery of insulin in full Automated Mode.
Activity is a temporary mode which the user may select for various time durations during
automated mode up to 24 hours. With Activity, the algorithm reduces insulin delivery and sets a
temporary glucose target to 150 mg/dL. Activity is intended for use during periods when insulin
sensitivity is expected to be higher, such as during exercise.

Current and non-Dexcom G6 iCGM users who did not meet the
minimum CGM data requirements participated in Phase 1 (where
subjects managed their diabetes at home per their usual routine and
remained on their current MDI or pump therapy, and sensor, if
applicable). After completion of the standard therapy phase, subjects
were trained on the system and transitioned to Phase 2 initiating
treatment with the Omnipod 5 System. A subset of subjects participated
in prescribed challenges during any consecutive 2-day period during
Phase 2. Subjects who completed Phase 2 could commence their
participation in Phase 3.

Subgroup Analysis of Average Results by Baseline Treatment
The table below provides information on the average glycemic results at baseline (or during
standard therapy phase) and the 3-month Omnipod 5 System treatment phase analyzed by
baseline treatment (standard therapy). Standard therapy consisted of multiple daily insulin
injections (MDI) or insulin pump use.

2. Human Factors Testing:
Human factors validation testing was conducted with the Omnipod 5 App installed on a
compatible mobile device with interoperable technology. The final device design was evaluated
in the summative study performed with 16 representative participants (i.e., caregivers of children
2-5.9 years old) interacting with the device in a simulated use environment. All study
participants received training that was consistent with the training that patients would receive
with the commercial product. Usability evaluations assessed comprehension and usability of the
device for critical device tasks. Results of the study demonstrated that the device could be used
safely by intended users in the intended use environment when used in combination with a
digitally connected device.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
