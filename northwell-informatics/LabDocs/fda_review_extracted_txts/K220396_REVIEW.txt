III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The EasyStat 300 is designed for clinical laboratory use, making quantitative measurements of
potassium (K+), ionized calcium (Ca++), and chloride (Cl-) in whole blood (arterial/venous)
samples from Li-Heparinized Syringes. This Analyzer should only be used by trained technicians
in clinical laboratories to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with electrolyte and/or
acid-base disturbances.
Potassium (K+) measurements are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and
treatment of diseases conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium levels.
Calcium (Ca++) (ionized) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid
disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany (intermittent muscular
contractions or spasms).
Chloride (Cl-) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic
disorders such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
EasyStat 300 Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The candidate device is a small bench-top analyzer for use by health care professionals. The
analyzer incorporates a replaceable EasyStat 300 ISE cartridge that is comprised of sensors for
measurement of potassium, chloride, and calcium. The analyzer also incorporates a replaceable
reagent module (i.e., EASYSTAT 300 REAGENT MODULE) containing calibrating solutions
for the sensors. The reagent module contains encoded reagent information (calibration values
and expiration date), which is read by the analyzer upon installation of the reagent module.
Calibrations are performed automatically or on-demand by the user. The analyzer draws 175μL
of whole blood (lithium heparinized venous whole blood and arterial blood) when operated in the
syringe mode. Quality control materials (i.e., EasyQC BGME Level 1, 2, and 3), cleaning
solution, replacement reference electrode, bubble detection, and troubleshoot kit are provided for
the system.

The EasyStat 300 Analyzer was also cleared for making quantitative measurements of pO2
(partial pressure of oxygen), pCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), and pH (hydrogen ion
activity) in K211559.
B Principle of Operation:
The potassium, chloride, and ionized calcium parameters are measured by ion-selective
electrodes (ISE). When the ISE is in fluidic contact with a sample, an electrochemical potential
is developed versus a reference electrode, and is proportional to the logarithm of the ionic
activity, as described by the Nernst equation.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the EasyStat 300 was evaluated in two studies.
Study #1 - Within-Device using controls
In the study, three samples of aqueous control material were assayed on each of three
analyzers in duplicates per run, two runs per day for 20 days, for a total of 80 measurements
per sample per analyzer. The samples were tested on the analyzer operated in syringe mode.
For each of the three analyzers, the data was analyzed for repeatability (i.e., within-run) and
within-device precision. The results from one representative analyzer are summarized below.

3 0.53 80 0.00 0.3% 0.00 0.3%
Study #2 – Venous whole blood
In the study, with each analyte (K+, Cl-, and Ca++) and for each of five days, a lithium
heparin venous whole blood sample was collected from a donor, and each day a different
donor. Each sample per day was prepared into three analyte levels with normal analyte
(n=5), spiked (n=5), and diluted (n=5) for a total of 15 samples of each level. On each of five
days, the samples were each assayed in replicates of five using each of three analyzers (n=25
for each sample tested). The analyzer was operated in the syringe mode. The results were
analyzed for each sample using a fully-nested random effects variance components model to
compute the mean result, and the within-sensor (repeatability), between-analyzer and total
(reproducibility or within-laboratory) standard deviations and associated %CVs were
estimated, using the methodology as recommended in CLSI guidance document EP05-A3.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted using a linearity set of 9 samples prepared from lithium
heparin venous whole blood samples. Each of the 9 samples was assayed in triplicate on
each of three analyzers. The study was conducted with the analyzers operated in syringe
mode. For potassium, chloride, and calcium, regression analysis demonstrated first order
linearity. The results of the linear regression analysis from one representative analyzer are
summarized below:

Calcium 0.25 - 5.0 0.22 - 5.28 0.96 0.01 1.000
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity performance of the EasyStat 300 Analyzer for potassium, chloride,
and calcium was evaluated by testing for interference from endogenous and exogenous
substances. In the study, lithium heparin venous whole blood samples were prepared at two
analyte concentrations. Each sample was further divided into two aliquots; i.e. test sample
(with added interferent) and control sample (with no added interferent). Each test and control
sample was assayed in replicates of five on each of three analyzers operated in syringe mode.
A substance was identified as an interferent if the difference in the mean between the test and
control sample was outside of the predefined allowable difference, as shown below:

The sponsor added the following limitations to their labeling:
• Potassium levels should not be relied upon in patients suspected of ibuprofen toxicity, as
very high concentrations of ibuprofen may cause positive bias for potassium.
• Bromide and iodide from therapeutic drugs and ointments may cause a positive bias for
chloride. Normal physiological levels of bromide and iodide do not interfere.
• This device should not be used with patients taking perchlorate.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See linearity.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The metrological traceability of the EasyStat 300 for potassium, chloride, and calcium was
reviewed and found acceptable.
6. Detection Limit:
The performance at the lower end of the measuring range for potassium and chloride is
supported by the linearity studies (see section VII.A.2 above). The sponsor performed a
study to evaluate the limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantification
(LoQ) for ionized calcium following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB
In the study, five pooled plasma samples ultracentrifuged to lower the calcium concentration
were assayed in replicates of two with each of two reagent lots on one analyzer over three
days, for a total of 60 measurements. The LoB was determined using parametric analysis as
described in CLSI EP17-A2.
LoD
In the study, five pooled plasma samples ultrafiltered to lower the calcium concentration near
the LoD were assayed in replicates of two with each of two reagent lots on one analyzer over
three days, for a total of 60 measurements. The LoD was analyzed using parametric data
analysis as described in CLSI EP17-A2.
LoQ
In the study, four pooled samples with concentrations near the expected LoQ were prepared,
and then analyzed with each of two reagent lot on one EasyStat 300 analyzer with three
replicates per day over three consecutive days total of 18 replicates per sample. The LoQ was

determined as the measured sample concentration meeting the total allowable error goals of
±0.10 mmol/L.
The detection limit studies support the claimed measuring range of 0.25-5.0 mmol/L for
ionized calcium.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The agreement accuracy of the candidate device was evaluated in a method comparison study
versus a comparator device. In the study, lithium heparin venous and arterial whole blood
samples were collected from 198 subjects across two sites (one hospital and one internal),
and each tested in duplicate on the EasyStat 300 Analyzer in syringe mode, and in duplicate
on the comparator. The average of the two readings using the comparator and the first of the
two EasyStat 300 Analyzer reading was used in the data analysis by linear regression. To
cover the measurement range, no more than 10% of the samples were diluted and/or spiked.
The sponsor provided acceptable evidence to support pooling the results from venous and
arterial samples in the same analysis. The results of the method comparison study are
summarized as follows.
