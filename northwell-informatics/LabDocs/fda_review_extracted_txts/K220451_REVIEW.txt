B Measurand:
Methamphetamine, Noroxycodone, Benzodiazepines, and Methadone
C Type of Test:
Chemiluminescent immunoassay
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Evidence MultiSTAT DOA Urine MultiPlex is intended for use with the Evidence
MultiSTAT. The Evidence MultiSTAT is an analyzer intended for the qualitative determination
of parent drug molecule and metabolites of drugs in human urine at the associated cutoffs.
The Evidence MultiSTAT DOA Urine MultiPlex detects the following drugs at the following
cut-offs:
Analyte Analyte in Cut Off Material Cut-Off
Benzodiazepines I Oxazepam 200 ng/mL
Methamphetamine S-(+)-Methamphetamine 500 ng/mL
Noroxycodone Noroxycodone 100 ng/mL
Methadone (±)-Methadone 300 ng/mL
The Evidence MultiSTAT DOA Urine MultiPlex provides only a preliminary analytical test
result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and/or Liquid
Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) are the preferred confirmatory
methods. Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and
professional judgement should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
preliminary positive results are obtained.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

• MultiSTAT Reconstitution Buffer – A solution at a neutral pH containing preservatives.
B Principle of Operation:
The candidate device performs simultaneous detection of multiple analytes from a single sample.
The core technology is the Randox Biochip, a solid-state device containing an array of discrete
test regions containing immobilized antibodies specific to different Drugs of Abuse (DOA)
compound classes. A competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay is used for the DOA assays
with the drug in the specimen and drug labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) being in
direct competition for the antibody binding sites. Increased levels of drug in a specimen will lead
to reduced binding of drug labelled with HRP and thus a reduction in chemiluminescence being
emitted. The light signal generated from each of the test regions on the biochip is detected by a
Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera in the Evidence MultiSTAT analyzer which, together
with the analyzer software, is used to quantify the light output and produce results. The tests
employ a qualitative reporting method. Each test sample is assayed against the provided Cut Off
material of known concentration, which is used to determine the classification of the samples
based on the comparison of the signal output.
The immunoassay processes are performed automatically in a self-contained and sealed biochip
cartridge, which holds the biochips, the reagents, wash buffer and other fluids required for the
test to be conducted.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Evidence MultiSTAT
2. Specimen Identification:
K220451 - Page 4 of 22

--- Page 5 ---
Specimens are identified by means of a barcode which is read by the analyzer. Specimen
identification can also be entered manually through the touchscreen.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Controls, cutoff calibrators, and patient samples must be manually pipetted into specific
sample wells on the cartridge, which is then inserted manually into the analyzer.
4. Calibration:
The MultiSTAT assays employ a qualitative reporting method. Each test sample is assayed
against a single Cut Off material of known concentration (‘single point calibrant’) which is
used to determine the classification of the samples based on the comparison of the signal
output between the Cut Off material and the test sample.
5. Quality Control:
A positive control is included with each MultiSTAT cartridge and users are instructed to
analyze the controls with each run.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate potential interference from various endogenous
and exogenous compounds.
Using drug free negative urine two spiked samples were prepared, one at -50% of the
Cut Off and one at +50% of the Cut Off. These samples were then divided into two portions
where half was spiked with the interferent (test) and the other half was spiked with the same
volume of matrix as a control. For each interferent there were four samples:
• Cut Off -50% spiked with Blank (Control)
• Cut Off -50% spiked with Interferent (TEST)
• Cut Off +50% spiked with Blank (Control)
• Cut Off +50% spiked with Interferent (TEST)

No interference was seen for any of the assays except for Ranitidine with the methadone
assay. The sponsor repeated the study with lower amounts of ranitidine and found that the
highest concentration that did not interfere with the methadone assay was 0.1 mg/mL.
The sponsor performed a study to determine if the specific gravity of the samples interfered
with the results. The Specific Gravity of drug free negative urine aliquots was adjusted to a
range from 1.000 to 1.030. For each Specific Gravity (sG) level two spiked samples were
prepared, one at -50% of the Cut Off and one at +50% of the Cut Off. No positive or
negative interference was seen with any of the assays at the specific gravities tested.
The sponsor also performed a study to determine if the pH of the samples interfered with the
results. The pH of drug free negative urine aliquots was adjusted to a pH range of 3 to 11.
For each pH level two spiked samples were prepared, one at -50% of the Cut Off and one at
+50% of the Cut Off. No positive or negative interference was seen with any of the assays at
the pH levels tested.
The sponsor also performed a study to determine the cross-reactivity from structurally related
compounds by identifying the concentration of a compound prepared in drug free negative
urine that would produce a positive response for each assay when analysed against the cut off
material. The results are summarized below.

The assays are traceable to commercially available standards.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable. The assays are qualitative and reported as positive or negative.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
See section VII.A.1 above for a description of how the device performs around the cutoffs.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable
9. Carry-Over:
All components of the assay that contact the urine sample are single use and disposable.
Therefore, carryover from one sample to another is not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted using clinical samples tested on the Randox
Evidence MultiSTAT DOA Urine Multi-Plex and compared to results from a chemically
specific quantitative comparator method. Results are summarized below.
