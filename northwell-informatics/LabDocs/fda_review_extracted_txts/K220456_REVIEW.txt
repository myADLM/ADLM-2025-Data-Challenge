D Special Instrument Requirements:

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys FT4 IV contains the following components:
M: Streptavidin-coated microparticles 0.72 mg/mL; preservative
R1: Anti-T4-antibody; Monoclonal anti T4 antibody (rabbit) labeled with ruthenium complex 75
ng/mL; phosphate buffer 100 mmol/L, pH 7.0; preservative
R2: T4-biotin; Biotinylated T4 2.5 ng/mL; phosphate buffer 100 mmol/L, pH 7.0; preservative
B Principle of Operation:
The assay is an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay with an assay time of 18 minutes.
During the first incubation, 15 μL of sample is combined with a T4-specific antibody labeled
with a ruthenium complex. During the second incubation, biotinylated T4 and streptavidin-
coated microparticles are added, the still-free binding sites of the labeled antibody become
occupied, with formation of an antibody-hapten complex. The entire complex becomes bound to
the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into
the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the
electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell. Application of a voltage to the
electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.

the master curve for that reagent lot.

Six human serum samples and two levels of control material were assayed in duplicate, 2
runs per day for 21 days using a single reagent lot (n=84), results are summarized in the table

T4 was used as the sample blank. The high and blank samples were mixed to prepare a
dilution series with a total of 13 levels ranging from 0.08-9.64 ng/dL. Expected
concentrations were assigned using the Elecsys FT4 II assay on the cobas e411 analyzer.
Samples were tested by the candidate device using one cobas e 411 analyzer. The data was
analyzed using first-order Weight Least Squares regression (WLS) without intercept. The
results support the claimed measuring interval of 0.101 – 7.777 ng/dL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Exogenous Interferents
Exogenous interference studies were performed according to the CLSI EP07 3rd Edition
guideline. Two serum samples containing a low (1.5 ng/dL) and high (5 ng/dL) concentration
of free T4 were assayed using the cobas e 411 analyzer. Results from the spiked samples
were compared to results from the same serum sample pools without addition of the potential
interferents (control samples). Significant interference was defined as more than ± 10% bias
from the test results of the spiked sample when compared to the control sample. The
following substances did not cause interference at the concentrations listed below:

The following is included in the labeling:
- The drugs furosemide, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and levothyroxine sodium (L-T4,
synthetic levothyroxine) caused elevated FT4 recovery at the daily therapeutic
concentration.
- Any influence that might affect the binding behavior of the binding proteins can alter the
result of the FT4 tests (e.g., drugs, NTIs (Non-Thyroid Illness)), patients suffering from
FDH (Familial Dysalbuminemic Hyperthyroxinemia) or increased TBG in pregnancy.
- The test cannot be used in patients receiving treatment with lipid-lowering agents
containing D-T4. If the thyroid function is to be checked in such patients, the therapy
should first be discontinued for 4-6 weeks to allow the physiological state to become re-
established.
- In rare cases, interference due to extremely high titers of antibodies to analyte‑specific
antibodies, streptavidin or ruthenium can occur.
Cross-Reactivity
The candidate device was tested for potential cross-reactivity. Human serum samples were used
to prepare samples with free T4 concentrations of approximately 1.65 ng/dL, 2.66 ng/dL, 5.2
ng/dL and 8.3 ng/dL that were then spiked with the cross-reactants listed below at the
concentrations listed below. Samples were assayed in duplicate on the cobas e 411 analyzer. For
all substances tested, no significant cross-reactivity was defined as recovery ± 10% of initial
value. The following cross-reactants demonstrated no reactivity at the concentrations tested:

Biotin interference
Biotin interference was evaluated by spiking serum samples with low, medium, and high
concentrations of free T4 with 0, 75, 150, 300, 500, 750, 1050, 1200, 2400, 3600 and 10800
ng/mL biotin. Results from the spiked samples were compared to results from the same
serum sample pools without addition of the potential interferents (control samples).
Significant interference was defined as more than ± 10% bias from the test results of the
spiked sample when compared to the control sample. The maximum value with no
interference observed was 3600 ng/mL. The claim of the package insert is no interference up
to 1200 ng/mL.
The labeling includes the following:
Specimens that contain biotin at a concentration of 1200 ng/mL demonstrate less than or
equal to 10 % bias. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that serum concentrations of biotin
can reach up to 355 ng/mL within the first hour after biotin ingestion for subjects consuming
supplements of 20 mg biotin per day and up to 1160 ng/mL for subjects after a single dose of
300 mg biotin.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See Linearity section above.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The Elecsys FT4 IV assay is traceable to the Roche Elecsys FT4 II assay (K131244). The
Elecsys FT4 II assay is traceable to the Enzyme Test FT4 which has been standardized using
equilibrium dialysis.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
evaluated based on the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
To calculate LoB, one cobas e 411 analyzer was used with three reagent lots to assay free T4-
depleted human serum in six runs with ten replicates per run over three days (n=60

measurements/lot). LoB was determined to be 0.02 ng/dL per EP17-A2 as the linear
interpolation of the 57th and 58th ranked observation.
To calculate LoD, one cobas e 411 analyzer was used with three reagent lots to assay five
low-level free T4 serum samples. Each sample was measured in two replicates per run for 6
runs (one run per day, over multiple days). LoD was determined to be 0.04 ng/dL.
LoQ was determined by measuring ten low serum samples (diluted single donor sera with
free T4-depleted serum), in five replicates per run, one run per day, over 5 days, using 3 lots
of reagents (25 replicates per sample per reagent lot). LoQ is defined as the lowest analyte
concentration that can be reproducibly measured with an intermediate precision CV of ≤ 20
% and was determined to be 0.101 ng/dL.
These studies support the claimed analytical measuring interval of 0.101 – 7.7 ng/dL.
