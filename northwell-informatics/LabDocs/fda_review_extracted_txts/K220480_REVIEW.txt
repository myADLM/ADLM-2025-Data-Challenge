IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Revogene instrument was cleared under K170558 and is used with the following Revogene
cleared assays:
• Revogene GBS LB (cleared on May 25, 2017 under the name of GenePOC GBS LB,
K170557, software version 3.1.5 and firmware version 0.3.4);
• Revogene C. difficile (cleared on November 22, 2017 under the name of GenePOC CDiff,
K172569, software version 3.2.1 and firmware version 0.3.4);
• Revogene Strep A (cleared on March 6, 2019 under the name of GenePOC Strep A,
K183366, software version 4.0.10 and firmware version 2.1.0);
• Revogene Carba C (cleared on May 10, 2019 under the name of GenePOC Carba,
K190275, software version 4.0.10 and firmware version 2.1.0)
Briefly, the Revogene instrument is similar to a low-speed centrifuge to which are attached the
necessary components to perform the different steps of the diagnostic tests. It uses a disposable
microfluidic cartridge (named PIE) that contains the reagents required for analyte detection. The
Revogene can process from one (1) up to a maximum of eight (8) samples simultaneously in the
same run. The instrument must contain eight (8) PIEs. If eight (8) PIEs are not available, empty
spaces should be filled with MOCK PIEs.
The Revogene System is composed of the following:
• The Revogene instrument
• Revogene IVD Assays
• MOCK PIEs [A MOCK PIE mimics a test PIE and is used to complete the rotor when
less than eight (8) samples are processed in a single run. MOCK PIEs help maintain the
thermodynamic balance within a run]
In K220480, the device has been modified to implement a software change to Revogene that
updates the current software with a PMT surveillance algorithm. The software monitors raw data
fluorescence signal during assay testing and identifies issues due to a malfunction of the
photomultiplier tube (the “PMT”), a key component in the Revogene’s optics system used in the
management of fluorescence signals. Upon detection of a PMT malfunction, the PMT

surveillance algorithm software produces a specific error code to the user labeled “Detection
Error” and will lock the instrument thereby preventing further use.

B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Software Change
The software change is for the addition of a surveillance algorithm to the Revogene System
Software capable of detecting glitches associated with the PMT. This algorithm will prevent the
processing of raw data presenting glitches by the Results Processor and thus will minimize the
reporting of potential false-positive results. Verification and validation activities were performed
to ensure outputs met design inputs and that the Revogene System Software (version 4.3.4), as a
portion of the Revogene platform, met user needs, the intended use, and software requirements.
PMT Surveillance Algorithm Performance
The PMT surveillance algorithm design was assessed by running the algorithm on a dataset
constituting 593 runs, of which 500 runs were identified as normal runs that presented no PMT
glitches.
The PMT surveillance algorithm was able to:
• Identify correctly 100% of the normal runs
• Identify the glitches in 83 out of 93 runs with PMT failures (89.2%)
• Identify the glitches in 27 runs out of 29 runs with PMT failures leading to false positive
results (93.1%).
The surveillance algorithm was shown to flag instruments containing a faulty PMT and was
observed to have no impact on instruments that do not generate glitches. Detection error
messages were shown where glitches related to the PMT issue were identified. Testing indicated
that software version 4.3.4 could successfully process a multi-assay run, and therefore, has no
impact on the compatibility between the various Revogene assays.
