IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Colibrí System is designed to be used as an accessory for the downstream matrix assisted
laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and
antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) analyzers. It automates various manual sample
preparation steps in the workflow for the identification and AST of isolated colonies of gram-
negative and gram-positive bacterial species grown on solid culture media.
The Colibrí System automates the preparation of MALDI target slides for the bioMérieux
VITEK MS or the Bruker MALDI Biotyper CA systems that are used in clinical laboratories for
identification (ID) of organisms grown on plated media by MALDI-TOF MS. [Refer to the
K193138 Decision Summary for the device description and performance characteristics of the
sample preparation for bacterial identification and MALDI-TOF MS workflow.] The Colibrí
System automates the preparation of microbial suspensions at a known concentration for the
bioMérieux VITEK 2 System that is used in clinical laboratories for AST analyses. Moreover,
the Colibrí System is used for purity plate preparation for purity assessments.
The Colibrí system comprises the Colibrí Vision System and Colibrí Preparation Station
hardware modules and pipette tips, Primary Tubes, Spreader and nephelometer Verification Kit
K220546 - Page 3 of 25

--- Page 4 ---
as consumables. After appropriate plate incubation, the operator loads the plates into the Colibrí
Vision System and uses the Graphical User Interface (Image Reading Interface) to choose the
plates exhibiting adequate growth. The operator selects the isolated colonies on a digital plate to
be processed by assigning the automatic ID or AST tasks. After selecting colonies, the operator
manually loads the plates in the Colibrí Preparation Station where colonies are automatically
picked, spotted on the target slide and overlayed with the matrix for ID or suspended into the
dedicated solution for the preparation of the microbial suspension for AST testing and purity
assessment.
When used in conjunction with the bioMérieux VITEK 2, the Colibrí System can prepare
microbial suspensions by the direct colony suspension method. The onboard nephelometer and
pipetting system allow for the preparation of Secondary Tubes (AST suspensions) at the
appropriate concentration for AST analysis and the Colibrí Spreader is used for purity plate
preparation. The traceability of prepared secondary tubes and purity plates is maintained by
application of dedicated labels.
B Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Colibrí System comprised of the Colibrí Vision System and Colibrí Preparation Station
2. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Culture plates used for processing with the Colibrí System are prepared and sorted manually
to identify those with isolated colonies from gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria and
then labeled by applying a linear barcode to the base of the plate. After loading the plates into
the Colibrí Vision System, the operator must select the appropriate culture medium for image
acquisition to ensure that the appropriate optical parameters are applied. Following image
acquisition, the operator designates well-isolated colonies for picking and then manually
transfers the plates from the Colibrí Vision System to the Colibrí Preparation Station, where
the colonies are picked automatically and used to prepare a culture suspension at specific
turbidity for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) using the bioMérieux VITEK 2
system and bioMérieux VITEK 2 AST cards.
3. Microbial Suspension Preparation and AST Analysis:
Culture plates for processing are identified by the Colibrí Vision System by scanning the
manually applied linear barcode on the side of each plate. The barcode is used to orientate
the plate and, together with the plate’s geometric center, also used to define the Cartesian
coordinates of each of the colonies that are designated for picking. This information is
retrieved by the Colibrí Preparation Station, which picks the designated colonies from the
agar surface and deposits them into the Primary Tube containing a saline solution. The
Primary Tube is mixed with the on-board vortex and the turbidity is measured with the on-
board nephelometer. If needed, the suspension is adjusted with additional colonies, vortexed,
and measured again with the nephelometer. A specific aliquot is automatically transferred
from the Primary Tube into the labeled Secondary Tube to yield a microbial suspension with
appropriate turbidity for AST analysis with the bioMérieux VITEK 2 system and bioMérieux
VITEK 2 AST cards. There are no changes to the methods of data analysis or result
K220546 - Page 4 of 25

--- Page 5 ---
algorithms for the VITEK 2 system compared to those used in the 510(k)-cleared devices.
After preparation of the microbial suspension in the Secondary Tube, a labeled Purity Plate
may optionally be automatically prepared from the Secondary Tube.
4. Calibration:
Set-up calibration, auto-calibration, and run-time calibration checks are performed for the
Colibrí System, as described in the K193138 Decision Summary.
For the AST function, the Colibrí System requires a daily nephelometer verification to check
the proper reading of suspensions at different turbidity values. In addition, a nephelometer
set-up calibration is performed by the technical engineer as part of the system setup during
the initial device installation.
5. Quality Control:
Quality Control for AST testing was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions for the bioMérieux VITEK 2 system. CLSI-recommended reference strains
Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus
aureus ATCC 29213, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 were grown on trypticase soy
agar + 5% sheep blood. Microbial suspensions were prepared using three separate Colibrí
Systems and loaded in the appropriate VITEK 2 AST card. MIC values for each
drug/organism combination were compared to the expected MIC range. Purity of all the
suspensions was confirmed by purity plates prepared by the Colibrí System, with 100% of
purity plates showing monomicrobial growth. Quality control testing was performed daily
during analytical performance testing using the quality control bacterial strains in rotation,
and all results obtained were in-range. Results are summarized in Table 1. The quality
control testing is acceptable.

VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:
The following FDA-recognized Consensus Standards were referenced and pertain to device and
study design for the Colibrí System’s preparation of samples for AST:
• IEC 62304. Medical Device Software – Software Life Cycle Processes (Edition 1.1; 2015-
06).
• CLSI M07. Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow
Aerobically (11th Edition)
• CLSI M100. Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. (31st Edition)
• Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff – Class II Special Controls
Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems (August 28, 2009)
VII Performance Characteristics:
The performance of the Copan Colibrí System was evaluated in conjunction with the bioMérieux
VITEK 2 using the criteria for MIC interpretation as described in the VITEK 2 labeling. [Refer
to the K193138 Decision Summary for the performance characteristics of the sample preparation
for bacterial identification and MALDI-TOF MS workflow.]
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of MIC results obtained using microbial suspensions automatically
prepared by the Colibrí System was evaluated with the bioMérieux VITEK 2. For this study,
three Colibrí instruments (each comprised of a Colibrí Vison System and Colibrí Preparation
Station) were used to prepare microbial suspensions from overnight (18 to 24 hour) cultures
of 15 representative, clinically relevant bacterial isolates (seven gram-negative species and
eight gram-positive species including two Streptococcus spp., summarized in Table 2) grown
on trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood. Each isolate was tested with ≥4 drugs
representing different drug classes. Samples of each isolate were tested in triplicate on three
separate days. On each day that testing was performed, three different operators each
designated at least four (for gram-negative) or six (for gram-positive) colonies for automated
picking from digital images of each of the three culture plates corresponding to each bacterial
species. A total of 81 replicates per antimicrobial/organism combination were analyzed (3
Colibrí instruments x 3 operators x 3 replicates x 3 days).

Samples were prepared and assessed for purity consistent with the Colibrí System’s
instructions for use. The final suspension in the Secondary Tube was manually loaded into
the appropriate VITEK 2 AST card. The secondary tubes and corresponding AST cards were
processed by the VITEK 2 instrument. The reported MIC values were used to calculate
within-run, between-run, within-user, and between-user reproducibility.
Reproducibility was calculated as the total number of results that were within one doubling
dilution of the mode result divided by total number of results. Off-scale results that were one
doubling dilution from the mode were considered reproducible for best-case reproducibility
calculations but considered not reproducible for worst-case calculations.
In total, 9,639 MIC results were generated, with 9,597 of those results being on-scale. The
results for all samples are summarized and stratified by the tested antimicrobial in Table 3
for gram-negative species and Table 4 for gram-positive species. Reproducibility between
operators was also evaluated and is summarized in Table 5. For all antimicrobials evaluated,
best-case and worst-case reproducibility was ≥95%. Additionally, purity plates were
analyzed for monomicrobial growth. All purity plates displayed monomicrobial growth. The
reproducibility results are acceptable.

Colony Picking Accuracy
A total of 1,500 colonies were picked by three Colibrí System instruments to prepare
microbial suspensions consistent with those used for AST. Six clinically relevant gram-
negative (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa) and gram-positive (E. faecalis, S.
aureus, and S. pyogenes) species were used to prepare polymicrobial whole and bi-plates as
test plates for colony picking. The gram-negative species were mixed in a 1:1:1 ratio and
plated on tryptic soy agar with 5% sheep blood (whole and bi-plate), MacConkey agar
(whole and bi-plate), and chocolate agar (whole plate). The same process was followed for
the gram-positive species and suspensions were plated on tryptic soy agar with 5% sheep
blood (whole and bi-plate) and chocolate agar (whole plate).
Test plates were automatically processed by the Colibrí System – digital plate images were
acquired by the Vision System and the operator selected at least four isolated colonies for
gram-negative species and at least six isolated colonies for gram-positive species. For the bi-
plates, both sides were used for colony selection. Plates were then manually loaded into the

Preparation Station as input picking plates. Using the plate barcode, the Preparation Station
automatically picked the user-designated colonies and deposited them into the primary tube.
Primary tube suspensions were used to automatically prepare purity plates.
At the end of the automatic preparation, processed plates were visually inspected by the
operator and compared to the digital image captured by the Vision System to determine the
accuracy of the Colibrí System in picking the correct colony designated by the operator.
Outcomes were categorized as follows: correct colony picked, no colony picked, or incorrect
colony picked. Accuracy was calculated as the percentage of correctly picked colonies.
At least 139 pick points for each microorganism were made between all replicates. All
colonies (100%) were accurately and successfully picked. Data stratified by microorganism,
culture medium, and instrument are summarized in Table 6.

The designated colonies were picked accurately, with no evidence of microbial
contamination based on visual inspection of the purity plates. The accuracy of colony picking
by the Colibrí System for preparation of microbial suspensions for AST was therefore
determined to be acceptable.
Microbial Suspension Accuracy
Isolated colonies identified as part of the colony picking study were used by the Colibrí
Preparation Station to automatically prepare microbial suspensions in the primary tube. The
turbidity of each suspension was measured by the onboard nephelometer. Microbial
suspensions were then manually diluted, plated in triplicate, and colonies were counted to
determine if the automatically prepared suspensions contained the appropriate and expected
concentration of bacteria. Colony counts were deemed to be acceptable if they were within
the expected ranges calculated using the reference value of E. coli suspensions (a suspension
with turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland contains approximately 1-2x108 CFU/mL for E.
coli ATCC25955 according to CLSI M07), with the upper limit and lower limit
representative of 0.5 x 108 CFU/mL (half a doubling dilution) more or fewer bacteria,
respectively. Accuracy was calculated as the percentage of primary tubes with microbial
content in the expected range. In total, 60 microbial suspensions were prepared for each

Over 98% of microbial suspensions prepared using picked colonies were within the
acceptable limits. Therefore, the accuracy of microbial suspension preparation was
determined to be acceptable. These results further support the accuracy of colony picking by
the Colibrí System for preparation of microbial suspensions.
Accuracy of AST Results
The accuracy of MICs obtained by bioMérieux VITEK 2 with microbial suspensions
prepared by the Colibrí System was evaluated by testing representative strains of clinically
relevant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Three different Colibrí instruments
operated by three different operators were used to prepare suspensions from isolated colonies
of representative isolates of different species of Enterobacterales (n=62), Staphylococcus
spp. (n=16), Streptococcus spp. (n=30), Enterococcus spp. (n=16) and non-fermenting gram-
negative bacilli (n=32) grown on trypticase soy agar + 5% sheep blood, MacConkey agar,

Both susceptible and resistant strains exhibiting a range of on-scale MIC values were tested
against at least four antimicrobials representative of major drug classes. One VITEK 2 AST
system was used with various AST card types containing a broad range of concentrations of
specific drugs (VITEK cards used: GN74, Enterobacterales species; GN82, Non-fermenters
species; G67, Staphylococcus species; GP67, Enterococcus species; ST03, Streptococcus
species). Thirty-one different antimicrobial agents were analyzed, resulting in a total of 1,883
evaluable MIC results.
The MIC results obtained using the Colibrí System and VITEK 2 system were compared to
the results from manually prepared samples and the VITEK 2 system, consistent with the
VITEK 2 system instructions for use.
Essential Agreement (EA) was defined as MIC results from Colibrí System prepared samples
that were within one doubling dilution of the MIC results from the manually prepared
samples. Category Agreement (CA) was defined as MIC interpretations (S/I/R) that were the
same between the Colibrí System-prepared and manually prepared samples. Very major
errors were defined as false susceptible results from the Colibrí System prepared samples,
major errors were defined as false resistance results from the Colibrí System prepared
samples, and minor errors were defined as results with minor discrepancies (i.e., an
intermediate result reported as either resistant or susceptible, or vice versa). Since this is a
method-to-method comparison, results were considered acceptable if the EA and CA were
≥95% with no major or very major errors. Additionally, no significant differences should be
observed between the Colibrí Systems, operators, culture medium and incubation time.
For all species and antimicrobial agents, 1882/1883 (99.9%) of MIC results were within one
doubling dilution of the comparator result and 5947/5991 (99.26%) of SIR categorizations
were in agreement. Therefore, the EA of the evaluable MIC results was >99.9% and the CA
was 99.3%. For each microorganism, antimicrobial agent, instrument, operator, culture
medium and incubation time, both essential agreement and categorical agreement were
>95%. No very major errors occurred. One major error (false resistance) occurred for the

monomicrobial growth.
Table 9 summarizes the results stratified by antimicrobial/organism group combinations.
Due to the high degree of agreement between MICs determined from manual and Colibrí
preparations, the AST accuracy was determined to be acceptable.

EA = essential agreement; CA = category agreement; S = susceptible; R = resistant; vmj = very major
error; maj = major error; min = minor error; * one major error (false resistance) occurred for the
preparation of P. aeruginosa with Cefepime. The preparation of this strain was repeated manually and
with the Copan Colibrí System three times. Both preparations generated a susceptible result with all
MICs within one two-fold dilution. This major error was therefore likely to be due to random error.
5. Carry-Over:
The ability of the on-board incinerator to properly sterilize the spreader after preparation of a
purity plate was analyzed using positive samples (suspensions of Geobacillus
stearothermophilus prepared at a turbidity equal to a 2 McFarland turbidity standard) and
negative samples (saline, aqueous 0.45% NaCl, pH 4.5-7.0; the same solution used in
Secondary Tubes). G. stearothermophilus was selected as a representative strain due to it
resistance to heat. Eight replicates of positive and negative samples were alternatively
processed using three Colibrí Systems to prepare purity plates on Chocolate agar. Purity
plates were incubated at 55°C±2°C for 48 hours and growth was observed. No growth was
observed on any purity plates prepared from negative samples.

The data demonstrate that the on-board incinerator can effectively sterilize the spreader and
avoid carry-over between purity plates and is acceptable.
B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Pipettor Trueness and Precision
The trueness and precision of the onboard pipettor was determined using three different Colibrí
System pipettors. Four volumes representing 5% (50 µL), 10% (100 µL), 50% (500 µL), and
90% (900 µL) of the nominal volume of the 1000 µL tip used for AST preparations were tested
on each instrument. For each device and each target volume, 10 replicates were performed using
saline solution (aqueous 0.45% NaCl, pH 4.5 to 7.0, the same solution required for microbial
suspension preparation for the VITEK 2 AST procedure). The actual dispensed volume was
calculated from the net weight of the liquid.
For each target volume, systematic and random errors were calculated for each instrument and
for overall performance. To estimate trueness, the systematic error (SE) was calculated as the
deviation of the mean true volume from the target volume. To estimate precision, the random
error (RE) was expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV) representing the ratio between the
sample standard deviation and the mean volume. A summary of results for all samples and
instruments, including acceptance criteria, is shown in Table 10.

CV = Coefficient of Variation
For each tested volume, systematic and random errors were within the acceptance criteria for
each instrument and overall. Therefore, the trueness and precision of the pipettor were deemed
acceptable.
Accuracy of the Onboard Nephelometer
Nephelometer calibration verification was performed to demonstrate that the on-board
nephelometer that is part of the Colibrí system can be consistently and properly calibrated and
will provide turbidity measurements, in the form of McFarland values, that will accurately
estimate the concentration of bacteria present in microbial suspensions within the calibration
range. Three different Colibrí systems and three lots of turbidity standards were used. Isolated
colonies of E. coli ATCC 25922 grown on non-selective medium were used to manually prepare
suspensions at determined concentrations (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, McFarland). Twenty
suspensions were prepared by three operators for each concentration and the turbidity of each

suspension was measured using the on-board nephelometer. Suspensions were then diluted,
plated, and colonies were counted to determine the initial tube concentration.
A total of 300 suspensions were prepared. The ability of Colibrí on-board nephelometer to
accurately prepare microbial suspensions was measured calculating their concentration from
colony enumeration and comparing it to the expected concentration based on the nominal
turbidity value (calculated based on the assumption that a suspension with turbidity equivalent to
0.5 McFarland contains approximately 1-2x108 CFU/mL for E. coli ATCC25955 according to
CLSI M07). To be acceptable, at least 98% of suspensions should contain the expected
concentration of E. coli. Data is summarized in Table 11, including between-instrument one-way
ANVOA comparison to assess statistical differences between instruments. No statistically
significant differences were observed.

All the suspensions (100%) prepared with the Colibrí on-board nephelometer contained an
acceptable microbial concentration. Therefore, the nephelometer can provide McFarland values
that accurately estimate the concentration of bacteria in microbial suspension and is acceptable.
E. coli Suspensions Preparation Verification Study
The ability of the Colibrí System to prepare primary tubes at various concentrations with the
expected number of microorganisms was assessed using E. coli ATCC 25922. Three Colibrí
systems run by three different operators were included in the study. A variable number of
colonies ranging from 1 to 13 were selected from Trypticase Soy Agar + 5% sheep’s blood plates
grown aerobically at 35◦C for 14-24 hours to create suspensions at increasing turbidity values.

Primary tubes with a turbidity value inside the working range (0.25 McFarland – 1.75
McFarland) were processed automatically to prepare secondary tubes. Primary tubes with
turbidity values outside the working range were automatically moved to the back table of the
Colibrí instrument. Primary tubes moved to the back table were discarded. Primary tubes that
were processed were ten-fold diluted and enumerated in triplicate. The turbidity value after
nephelometer check and colony count obtained from each suspension of processed primary tubes
were recorded. To correlate turbidity measurements with colony counts after enumeration, it was
assumed that the 0.5 McFarland has a nominal content of 1-2 × 108 CFU/mL for E. coli (as
described in CLSI guidance M07, 11th edition, 2018).
A total of 144 suspensions were prepared (16 per operator on 3 Colibrí systems with 3 different
lots of turbidity standards). Results were deemed acceptable if colony counts were within the
expected concentration ranges (with the lower range estimating a nominal content of 1 × 108
CFU/mL for E. coli and the upper range estimating a nominal content of 2 × 108 CFU/mL for E.
coli in a suspension with a 0.5 McFarland turbidity reading). For all combined instruments,
≥98% of suspensions should exhibit colony counts within the acceptance criteria. Table 12
shows the percentage of acceptably prepared suspensions (number of suspensions within the
expected concentration range / the total number of suspensions prepared).

100% of suspensions over the entire working range contained the expected number of colonies.
Therefore, the ability of the Colibrí System to automatically pick colonies and generate Primary
Tubes with expected turbidity values using the on-board nephelometer and with the expected
number of microorganisms is acceptable.
Purity Plate Growth
To additionally evaluate the potential for cross-contamination between purity plates due to
incomplete/improper sterilization of the on-board spreader by the incinerator, the totality of
purity plate preparation results across all analytical studies provided in K220546 were evaluated.
Table 13 below lists the number of purity plates analyzed in each analytical study and shows the
percentage of purity plates that exhibited monomicrobial growth.

Of the strains analyzed, a minimum of 27 replicates of ATCC strains (Enterococcus faecalis,
Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and
Streptococcus pyogenes) and a minimum of three replicates of clinical strains (Acinetobacter
baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella (Enterobacter) aerogenes,
Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus spp., E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Morganella morganii, Proteus
mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, Raoultella planticola, Salmonella ser. Typhimurium,
Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp.) were included. All ATCC
strains (426/426, 100%) and clinical strains (1938/1938, 100%) exhibited monomicrobial growth
after purity plate preparation. Both bi-plates and whole plates were used for colony picking prior
to preparation of purity plates. Purity plates from all bi-plates (99/99, 100%) and all whole plates
(2265/2265, 100%) exhibited monomicrobial growth. Based on the totality of evidence, carry-
over and cross-contamination risk was deemed to be acceptably low.
Reagent Hold Time
This study verifies that on the Preparation Station deck of the Colibrí instrument, the
environmental conditions (specifically, the temperature) are within the recommended stability
conditions of the Secondary Tubes. The open-vial stability of the primary tubes was assessed
during real time stability evaluation shelf-life studies. This reagent hold time study was
conducted with the Secondary Tubes. Secondary Tubes were manually filled with the standard
saline solution (aqueous 0.45% to 0.50% NaCl, pH 4.5-7.0). The temperature inside the Colibrí
Preparation Station was measured using a datalogger over the course of 10 days during standard
use of the instrument and recorded temperature values were compared to that recommended by
the manufacturer of the Secondary Tubes and saline solution. A second data logger outside of the
instrument was used to provide the reference temperature of the room. The study was conducted
using one Colibrí instrument. The mean, minimum, and maximum recorded temperatures for
both the tube carousel and the reference temperature of the room are summarized in Table 14.

Data suggest the presence of electronic components in the instrument only minorly contribute to
the temperature inside the Colibrí Preparation Station; the internal temperatures follow the same
trend of the room temperature, and the temperature never exceeds the storage temperature
recommended for the secondary tubes and saline solution. The environmental conditions of the
deck of the Colibrí Preparation Station do not appear to affect the stability of the saline solution
and/or the secondary tube and are acceptable.
