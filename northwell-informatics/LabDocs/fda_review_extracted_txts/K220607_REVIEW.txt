performed directly on the specimen, utilizing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the
amplification of relevant gene target DNA/RNA. The test utilizes fluorogenic gene-specific
hybridization probes for detection of the amplified DNA.
This test is intended for use, in conjunction with clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and
epidemiological information, as an aid in the differential diagnosis of Norovirus GI & GII,
Rotavirus A, Adenovirus F40/41, Sapovirus (genogroups I, II, IV, V), and hAstro infections.
Results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient
management decisions. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other organisms that are
not detected by this test, and may not be the sole or definitive cause of patient illness. Negative
results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to infection by

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel (BD MAX EVP) is a gastrointestinal bacterial panel multiplex
nucleic acid-based assay system comprised of an instrument with associated hardware and
accessories, disposable microfluidic cartridges, real-time PCR master mixes, unitized reagent
strips, extraction reagents, and sample buffer tubes (SBT). The instrument automates sample
preparation including target lysis, DNA extraction and concentration, reagent rehydration, and
target nucleic acid amplification and detection using real-time PCR. The assays include a Sample
Processing Control (SPC) that is present in the Extraction Tube. The SPC monitors DNA
extraction steps, thermal cycling steps, reagent integrity and the presence of inhibitory
substances. The BD MAX System software automatically interprets test results. The BD MAX
Enteric Viral Panel performed on the BD MAX system is FDA cleared under K181427.
The BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel instructions for use include testing of unpreserved stool
specimens collected and transported to the laboratory in a dry, clean container, Cary-Blair
preserved stool specimens collected using a plastic paddle (scoop) to place a stool sample into 15
mL of Cary-Blair media for transport, or stool specimens collected and transported using the
Copan FecalSwab Collection, Transport, and Preservation System (Copan FecalSwab). Stool
specimens from rectal swabs or fixed stools have not been validated with the BD MAX EVP.
The Copan FecalSwab is comprised of a nylon flocked specimen collection swab co-packaged
with a tube filled pre-filled with 2 mL of a modified Cary-Blair preservative. The Copan
FecalSwab is also co-branded as the BD FecalSwab Collection, Transport and Preservation
System (BD FecalSwab); the terms Copan FecalSwab, BD FecalSwab, and FecalSwab are used
interchangeably.
For the BD MAX EVP a test result may be called as POS, NEG or UNR (Unresolved) based on the
amplification status of the targets and of the Sample Processing Control. IND (Indeterminate) or INC
(Incomplete) results are due to BD MAX System failure.
B Principle of Operation:
A stool specimen is collected and transported to the laboratory in a dry, clean container (for
unpreserved specimens), in Cary-Blair transport media, or using the Copan FecalSwab
Collection, Transport, and Preservation System. Unpreserved stool samples and Cary-Blair
K220607 - Page 3 of 19

--- Page 4 ---
preserved stool samples are placed in a BD MAX SBT using a 5 μL transfer loop for analysis on
the BD Max System.
To use the Copan FecalSwab stool specimens, the operator transfers fecal material from an
unpreserved stool specimen to the vial of FecalSwab transport medium using the nylon flocked
specimen collection swab. The operator unscrews the cap of the FecalSwab transport medium
tube and transfers the swab with sample into the tube. The operator breaks the swab shaft at the
break point line molded into the shaft, discards the handle part of the swab shaft, and screws the
cap onto the FecalSwab tube to close. Before analysis on the BD MAX system, FecalSwab stool
samples are vortexed and then 25 μL of sample is pipetted into a BD MAX SBT.
The SBT is closed with a septum cap and vortexed. A worklist is created and the SBT, unitized
reagent strips, master mix, extraction tubes, and PCR cartridges are loaded onto the BD MAX
System. The BD MAX System automates sample preparation including cell lysis, DNA
extraction and concentration, reagent rehydration, and target nucleic acid amplification and
detection using real-time PCR. Amplified targets are detected with hydrolysis probes labeled
with quenched fluorophores. The amplification, detection and interpretation of the signals are
done automatically by the BD MAX System.
C Interpretation of Results
Targets amplified by both mastermixes D6 and D5 are detected with hydrolysis probes
(TaqMan probes) labelled at one end with a fluorescent reporter dye and at the other end with a
quencher moiety. Six separate probes labelled with different reporter dyes are used to detect, in
four different BD MAX System optical channels, the amplicons generated by their respective
primers for MM D6 Enteric Viral Panel targets (Astrovirus, Sapovirus, and a sample processing
control) and eight probes for MM D5 Enteric Viral Panel targets (Adenovirus, Norovirus,
Rotavirus, and a sample processing control). The BD MAX System monitors several
amplification curve metrics including: the fluorescence height at the end of the amplification
curve (EP fluorescence), the location and value of the curve’s first derivative, the location and
value of the curve’s second derivative, the threshold cycle value with an additional quality
control applied to prevent false positives due to signal drift (Ct.Score), and measurements of
system noise along the PCR amplification curve. Curve metrics are transformed into results via
comparison of the metrics to cutoffs and the use of logic statements. Specifically, cutoffs are
applied to the Ct.Score and EP values to determine amplification status with other metrics
serving as quality controls.
Results are available on the “Results” tab in the “Results” window on the BD MAX System
monitor. The BD MAX System software automatically interprets test results. Results are
reported for each of the analytes and for the Sample Processing Control. A test result may be
called as NEG (negative), POS (positive) or UNR (unresolved) based on the amplification status
of the target and of the Sample Processing Control. IND (Indeterminate) or INC (Incomplete)
results are due to BD MAX System failure and require sample repeat testing. A sample can be
re-tested directly from the already prepared Sample Buffer Tube or following the preparation of
a new Sample Buffer Tube inoculation. In the case of a partial UNR, where one or more targets
have a POS result and all other targets have a UNR result, the targets with a UNR result will not
be called NEG. This will be reported on a per Master Mix basis.
K220607 - Page 4 of 19

--- Page 5 ---
Erroneous results may occur from improper specimen collection, handling, storage, technical
error, specimen mix-up or because the number of organisms in the specimen is below the
analytical sensitivity of the test.
The Sample Processing Control has been added to the test to aid in the identification of samples
that contain inhibitors to PCR amplification and as a control for reagent integrity and of the assay
system as a whole. The Sample Processing Control does not indicate if nucleic acid has been lost
due to inadequate collection, transport or storage of samples, or whether viral capsids have been
adequately lysed.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Please refer to K181427.
An additional specimen stability study was conducted to evaluate specimen stability in
FecalSwab collection tube and corresponding SBT meet the following BD MAX EVP
assay specimen stability claims:
A. FecalSwab stool specimens before testing: 25 ± 2 ˚C up to 48 hours (2 days), or 2-
8˚C (5 °C ± 3 °C) up to 120 hours (5 days)
B. Specimen added to the BD MAX Sample Buffer Tube (SBT): 25 ± 2˚C up to 48
hours (2 days) or 2-8˚C up to 120 hours (5 days)
FecalSwab collection tubes were prepared with the positive and negative matrices for
testing. Four positive FecalSwab tubes and one negative FecalSwab tube from each of
three lots were prepared for each time point. Two BD MAX Sample Buffer Tubes were
prepared from each FecalSwab tube. A minimum of 24 test results for positive specimens
and six test results for negative specimens were performed at each test point. To
determine stability, contrived samples containing Rotavirus A strain Va70, Adenovirus
Type F41, and Astrovirus Type 4 were prepared from viral stocks. Stability testing for
Norovirus GII and Sapovirus GI utilized quantitated clinical specimens. All positive
samples contained analyte levels at 3X LoD.

The acceptance criteria for the study were 100% of spiked positive samples at baseline
should report “POS” as the result and 100% of un-inoculated negative samples at
baseline should report “NEG” as the result. For all subsequent time points, ≥95% of
spiked positive samples should report “POS” as the result and 100% of un-inoculated
negative samples should report “NEG” as the result. A minimum of 24 valid results for
positive and 6 valid results for negative samples at each test point was required.
All target organisms passed the prespecified acceptance criteria, therefore the data were
considered acceptable for the proposed stability claim. Stool preserved in FecalSwab can
be stored for up to 120 hours (5 days) at 2 - 8 °C or for up to 48 hours at 2 – 25 °C.
Inoculated Sample Buffer Tube can be stored at 2 - 8 °C for a maximum of 120 hours (5
days) or at 2 - 25 °C for a maximum of 48 hours (2 days).
6. Limit of Detection - Equivalency Study
The LoD for each target on the BD MAX EVP panel was previously determined in
unpreserved stool specimens and Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens (see K181427). A
LoD equivalency study was performed to demonstrate comparable analytical sensitivity
for the BD MAX EVP panel testing Cary-Blair preserved stool samples and FecalSwab
preserved stool samples.
Viral stocks were used for LoD serial dilution testing of Rotavirus A strain Va70,
Adenovirus Type F41, and Astrovirus Type 4. Quantitated positive stools diluted to a
working solution were used to generate the LoD dilutions for Norovirus GII and
Sapovirus GI. One viral stock or positive stool was tested for each of the above viruses.
Testing was performed with BD MAX EVP reagents, three lots of FecalSwab (4
FecalSwab replicates per reagent lot, 2 SBTs per FecalSwab), and one lot of Cary-Blair
preserved specimen medium. A five-fold serial titration resulting in a total of five
dilutions, was performed for each of the 5 assay targets and tested in both sample types
(Cary-Blair and FecalSwab). Sample Buffer Tubes (SBT) were created by pipetting 25
μL from FecalSwab or looping 5 μL loop from Cary-Blair, altogether 24 SBTs each. The
SBTs were tested on the BD MAX System.
Equivalence between the specimen collection methods was confirmed when LoDs for
each target were within one five-fold dilution of each other. LoD is defined as when
positivity is greater than 95% (23/24 or more POS or NEG results).
The LoDs using Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens and FecalSwab stool specimens
were within one five-fold dilution of each other for all EVP targets. All analytes met the
acceptance criteria and the results demonstrated comparable analytical sensitivity when
FecalSwab preserved stool specimens and Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens were
tested with BD MAX EVP targets on the BD MAX System.

7. Carry-Over:
Carry-over was established previously using unpreserved stool in EBP sample buffer
which represents the worst-case scenario for carry-over contamination; therefore,
additional studies were not necessary. Please refer to K181427.
8. Assay Cut-Off:
Assay cut-offs remain unchanged from the previously cleared version of the multiplex
panel (see K181427).
9. User Variability:
The objective of this study was to determine whether the preparation of the FecalSwab
collection tube by different users introduces variability in the expected results for the BD
MAX EVP assay on the BD MAX System.
Two different FecalSwab collection tubes were prepared by six different operators for
each of the five panel members. The test panel included contrived specimens co-spiked
with Norovirus and Astrovirus at the following levels: one negative sample, three
samples at 2x LoD, and one sample at 4x LoD. These targets were selected to represent
each of the two PCR Master Mix formulations of the BD MAX Enteric Viral Panel. All
steps subsequent to the FecalSwab preparation (i.e., pipetting to the BD MAX SBT,
application of the septum cap, final vertexing, and initiating the run on the BD MAX)
were performed by a single experienced BD MAX user.
For acceptance criteria, 100% negative results for the 12 negative samples, ≥95% positive
results for the 36 samples tested at 2X LoD, and 100% positive for the 12 samples tested
at 4X LoD.

observable effect on expected results with the BD MAX EVP on the BD MAX
System.
B. Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed to demonstrate equivalent performance
between testing FecalSwab stool specimens and Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens
with the BD MAX EVP on the BD MAX System.
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and in
compliance with applicable regulations and ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Informed
consent was not needed because only de-identified remnant specimens were enrolled and
tested. Fresh prospective specimens were collected at six external sites. Previously
characterized retrospective specimen were collected at two external sites and one internal
site at BD. Samples were also contrived, where applicable, at an internal BD site. The
following inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for prospective and retrospective
specimen collection:
• Prospective inclusion criteria: unpreserved soft to diarrheal stool specimen from a
pediatric or adult patient admitted to a healthcare facility (e.g., hospital, outpatient

Adenovirus contrived specimens were prepared such that a minimum of 50% of the
specimens contained analyte concentrations corresponding to 1.5x - 2x LoD in a unique
specimen matrix consisting of negative stool and collected using the FecalSwab. A total
of 53 positive and 53 negative contrived samples were prepared using 53 unique negative
specimen matrices, all of which had been previously determined to be negative for all
targeted analytes.

The primary study endpoint was to demonstrate equivalent performance of testing
FecalSwab stool specimens to the performance of testing Cary-Blair stool specimen with
the BD MAX EVP on the BD MAX System. Acceptance criteria were established as a
PPA of ≥ 95% for each target and an NPA of ≥ 90% for each target with 95% lower
bound of the confidence interval of ≥ 90% for each target for both PPA and NPA.
Percent agreement comparing the FecalSwab specimen performance to the Cary-Blair
specimen performance with the BD MAX EVP targets is presented in Tables 7-13.

These results demonstrate the FecalSwab specimen collection type has comparable and
acceptable performance when compared to the predicate Cary-Blair specimen type with all
targets in the BD MAX EVP on the BD MAX System.
Non-Reportable Results:
The rates of unresolved (UNR) results due to sample processing control (SPC) failure and
the rates of indeterminate (IND) results due to a BD MAX system failure were also
estimated for FecalSwab stool specimens and Cary-Blair stool specimens tested with the
EVP assay. The total non-reportable rates (NRR= UNR+IND) observed in the clinical
study was 0% (0/581) and 0% (0/581) for FecalSwab and Cary-Blair stool specimens,
respectively.
