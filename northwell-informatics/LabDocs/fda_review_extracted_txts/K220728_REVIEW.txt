IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Assay and Reagents
The vWF Ag is an immunoturbidimetric assay for the quantitative determination of von
Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen levels.
The vWF Ag kit consists of a ready to use Latex Reagent (4 x 2 mL vials / kit) which is a
suspension of small polystyrene particles (latex) coated with rabbit anti-human VWF antibodies.
The Reagent Diluent (4 x 4 mL vials / kit) is provided within the kit which is a solution
containing glycine. The Reagent Diluent is intended for dilution of the Latex Reagent. The vWF
Ag kit is completed by the Buffer (4 x 5 mL vials / kit) which is a glycine buffer. All
components contain sodium azide (>1 g/L) as a preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
The small polystyrene particles to which rabbit anti-human vWF antibodies have been attached
by covalent bonding are aggregated when mixing with samples containing von Willebrand
antigen. This aggregation is then detected turbidimetrically by the Sysmex CS-2500 analyzer, via
the increase in turbidity, which is proportional to the antigen level present in the test sample.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability (Single site): A single-site (internal) precision study was performed for the
performance evaluation of vWF Ag. The study was performed on 20 days with two runs per
day and two replicates (20 x 2 x 2) of each sample per run on one SYSMEX CS-2500
analyzer. One reagent lot was investigated in combination with three calibrator lots, in
addition, one calibrator lot was investigated in combination with three reagent lots for a total
of 240 determinations (i.e., 80 determinations per reagent or calibrator lot). Three plasma
pools (PP1–3) as well as three control materials (CPN, CPP, CPP 1:6 dilution) were
investigated as test samples. The samples were chosen to cover the respective measuring
interval of vWF Ag (4 to 300% of norm) and the medical decision levels (30% of norm, 50%
of norm). All measurands met the predefined acceptance criteria. The results for within-run,
between-lot and total imprecision are presented in the summary tables below.

2. Linearity:
The linearity study was performed following the CLSI EP06 2nd Ed guideline, on one day,
using three SYMEX CS-2500 analyzers with three lots of vWF Ag reagent (one lot per
analyzer), and four replicates of each sample (dilution). The dilution series was prepared by
mixing a high concentration sample pool (high pool) with a low concentration sample pool
(low pool). The high pool was prepared by spiking a normal plasma pool with a VWF
concentrate. The VWF deficient plasma was internally produced by immunoaffinity
chromatography.
Samples with 12 different dilutions were evaluated in the linearity study. Determination of
linearity was performed using weighted linear regression using no intercept in the model. The
deviation between the mean measured value and the predicted value of the linear regression
was calculated for each sample concentration. The calculated deviations were then compared
to the acceptance criteria and the linear range was defined accordingly. The results support
the linearity range of 4 to 300% of norm on the SYSMEX CS-2500 analyzer.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were conducted based on the CLSI EP07 3rd edition, and CLSI EP37 1st
edition guidelines.
Endogenous Interference Study:
Dose-response experiments were carried out to determine the degree of interference as a
function of the interferent concentration for endogenous interferents hemoglobin,
unconjugated bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, lipids, and rheumatoid factors. The interference
study was carried out with one SYSMEX CS-2500 analyzer and one vWF Ag lot. Each VWF
antigen level was investigated with five different test samples. Each sample was tested in
triplicate on one day and with one lot of Standard Human Plasma (SHP) as calibrator. For
testing the interference by human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMAs), 12 test samples (HAMA-
positive) and 12 control samples (HAMA-positive) were used as per CLSI 1/LA30-A.
Similarly, for the potential interference by lupus anticoagulant, 12 test samples (Lupus-
positive) and 12 control samples (Lupus-negative) were used. None of the listed endogenous
substances in the following table were found to cause interference up to the indicated
concentrations:
Interferent No interference up to:
Hemoglobin 712 mg/dL
Bilirubin ( unconjugated) 30 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated) 100 mg/dL
Lipids* 549 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factors 23 IU/mL
HAMA 499 ng/mL
Lupus Anticoagulant dRVVT ratio = 2.49
Exogenous Interference Study:
Interference study on potentially exogenous interfering substances (drug panel) were
conducted to evaluate the potential interference of over-the-counter drugs and prescription

which 2 samples were contrived. The remaining 20 samples belong to >20% of vWF
Ag norm. All sample measurements at storage condition of the sample stability study,
except for the measurement after storage at ≤ 70°C, were performed with one reagent
lot vWF Ag, one lot calibrator (SHP) as four single determinations on one SYSMEX
CS-2500 analyzer at the respective study site. Evaluation of sample stability at ≤ -70°C
were performed with another reagent lot vWF Ag, and another calibrator lot (SHP) on
one SYSMEX CS-2500 analyzer. One calibration curve was established (for each
reagent / calibrator lot) and used for the entire sample stability at each study site. The
data support a sample stability claim of 4 hours at 15 to 25°C (primary and secondary
cups), 4 hours at 15 to 25°C (once frozen), 3 months at ≤ -20°C, 6 months stability at
≤ -70°C.
b. Traceability Study
The objective of this study is to investigate the traceability of the assigned value of
SHP to the WHO 6th International Standard (IS) Factor VIII / Von Willebrand Factor
(NIBSC code 07/316). The study was carried out with three different reagent lots of
the vWF Ag assay, on one SYSMEX CS-2500 analyzer and three SHP lots. Four
vials of the WHO 6th International Standard for Factor VIII / Von Willebrand Factor
were investigated in single determination on one day and with one trained operator.
With each vWF Ag reagent lot three calibration curves were established with the
three SHP lots. The accuracy of the calibration curves was assessed by running the
appropriate control materials, Control Plasma N (normal) and Control Plasma P
(pathologic), before and after the measurements. The predetermined acceptance
criterion was fulfilled, confirming that the candidate vWF assay is traceable to WHO
6th International Standard Factor VIII / Von Willebrand Factor (07/316).
c. Shelf Life Stability of Reagent
The shelf life stability study for vWF Ag was performed in accordance with the CLSI
EP25-A, using an isochronous design, where the product was placed under the test
storage conditions (2 to 8°C) at the start of the study and then withdrawn for testing at
different time points (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months) using three lots of vWF Ag
vials. Four plasma pools as well as three control materials were investigated as test
samples. The samples were chosen to cover the respective measuring interval of vWF
Ag (4 to 300% of norm). The results support a reagent shelf-life stability claim of 18
months when stored at 2 to 8°C.
d. Shelf Life Stability of Calibrator
The shelf life stability study for SHP for use as calibrator for vWF Ag was performed
according to the CLSI EP25-A. The study was conducted by testing three SHP lots at
the following time-points (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 and 25 months). The SHP is
placed under the storage conditions (2 to 8°C) at the start of the study and then
withdrawn for testing at different time points throughout the study duration. Four to 8
replicates per sample were measured at each time point. The results support a shelf-
life stability claim of 24 months for SHP, when stored at 2 to 8°C .

5. Detection Limit:
The detection limits of the vWF Ag assay – limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD),
limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined following the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
The LoB study was performed with five independent analyte-free plasma samples internally
prepared by immunoaffinity chromatography. The study was carried out with one SYSMEX
CS-2500 analyzer, three different reagent lots, one calibrator lot, five analyte-free samples,
one single determination of four individual aliquots of each sample on three days, resulting in
in 60 measurements per reagent lot, and 180 measurements overall. The results determine the
LoB for the vWF Ag as 1.07% of norm.
The LoD study was performed with five independent low-analyte samples. The samples were
prepared by dilution of a normal plasma sample, to levels within the calibrated range but
below 4 % of norm with VWF deficient plasmas. The study was carried out with one
SYSMEX CS-2500 analyzer, three different reagent lots, one calibrator lot, five analyte-free
samples, one single determination of four individual aliquots of each sample on three days,
resulting in in 60 measurements per reagent lot, and 180 measurements overall. The results
determine the LoD for the vWF Ag as 1.81% of norm.
This LoQ study was with five independent low-analyte samples, by dilution of five 5
different normal plasma samples, with five 5 different VWF:Ag deficient plasma pools
resulting in low-analyte samples with 3 to 4% of norm VWF antigen (assigned value of the
LoQ samples). The study was carried out with one SYSMEX CS-2500 analyzer, three
different reagent lots, one calibrator lot, five low analyte samples, single determination of
four individual aliquots of each sample on three days, resulting in 60 measurements per
reagent lot, and 180 measurements overall. The results determine the LoQ for the vWF Ag as
3.12% of norm.

Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies was performed at three clinical study sites to compare the
performance of the vWF Ag assay on the SYSMEX CS-2500 analyzer with the STA - Liatest
VWF:Ag assay (K962675) on the STA R Max analyzer (K151867). A total of 370 samples
were evaluated from three sites. To support the intended use population, patient samples with
various demographics (i.e. age, gender, race/ethnicity), were included in the study. The
patient cohort included patients previously diagnosed with von Willebrand disease (VWD)
(VWD type 1, VWD type 2 (type 2A, 2B, 2M and 2N), VWD type 3, and patients with
acquired VWD), patients with hemophilia A, patient with platelet dysfunction and patients
without final VWD related diagnosis at the time of enrollment. All samples were collected in
3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant and tested in singlet with both methods (subject and
comparator). Patient sample demographics included 235 females and 135 males, ≥ 4 weeks
of age. Out of the 370 samples, 339 patients demonstrated VWF:Ag values inside the

site the plasma samples were measured with one vWF Ag lot, one SHP lot, on one SYSMEX
CS-2500 analyzer, in single determination. Results from all sites were pooled and all reference
intervals were established by calculating two-sided 95% central interval (2.5th /97.5th
percentiles) as the 97.5th percentile was found within the measuring interval. The results for the
generic VWF activity reference interval (pooled data of the multicenter study), ABO blood
