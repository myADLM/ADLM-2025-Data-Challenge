B Indication(s) for Use:
Disposable Urine Collection Tube is intended for the collection, transport and preservation of
urine specimens from the collection site to the testing laboratory. In the laboratory, urine
specimens are processed using standard clinical laboratory operating procedures for the
cultivation of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Disposable Urine Collection Tubes for the collection, transport and preservation system
consist of a safety rubber plug, a plastic cap and boric acid as an additive inside the tube. The
tube is made of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and the safety plug is made of butyl-rubber
while the disposable cap is made of Polyethylene (PE). The disposable tube device sustains the
viability of organisms during transport for up to 48 hrs. at 2-4oC and 22-25oC.There are two main
tube types (round and conical bottom), and four configurations by volume of urine for the round
bottom tubes (4 ml, 7 ml, 8 ml, 10 ml). The conical bottom tubes only have one configuration by
volume (8 ml). Each volume is available in yellow and white caps. The different device
configurations and information on the amount of preservative contained in each tube is provided
in table 1.

B Principle of Operation:
The Disposable Urine Collection Tube system is used to safely collect and transport urine from
collection sites to the testing laboratories. It is intended to be used by health care professionals.
The vacuum in the collection tube allows autofill the urine sample through the puncture needle
and the boric acid in the tubes prevents overgrowth of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Stability Verification Report:
The shelf life for the Disposable Urine Collection Tube was determined to be 18 months
from the date of manufacture when stored in well-ventilated clean room with the
environment of relative humidity not more than 80% and at temperature 22 – 25oC. The shelf
life of the Disposable Urine Collection Tube was evaluated using real-time aging
performance test at time points T = 0, 6, 12 and 18 months. At each time point, the following
performance tests were conducted as described below:
• Appearance test was carried out by inspecting visually for clear label, transparent
PET tube and any sign of deformation or breakage.
• Vacuum test was performed by measuring volume drawn into the Disposable Urine
Collection Tube between 90 to 110% of the nominal liquid capacity allowed.
• Physical and mechanical performance tests included leak test, strength test, and a 50
KPa pressure test.
• Mechanical stress test was conducted by checking the tubes could withstand
centrifugation.
• The strength test, and urine collection volume capacity test were carried out as part of
the evaluation.
• Sterility test and the standard of boric acid content used were also assessed.
• The package integrity was evaluated by visually checking for any changes or damage
to the package. Six lots of varying production were used for the studies and results
showed that all samples passed the real time aging test for 18 months at 22-25oC.
All the results were acceptable and support the claim that the Disposable Urine Collection
Tube is physically or visually stable for 18 months.

Sterilization:
The Disposable Urine Collection Tubes were sterilized by electron beam radiation with an
average dose of 20 kGy to achieve a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10-6 with a dosimeter
attached to monitor dosage through the sterilization process. Sterilization was validated
following ISO 11137-1: 2006 and ISO 11137-2: 2013 Sterilization of Health Care Products
Radiation guidelines. Sterility test was carried out according to ISO11137-2:2009 Medical
Devices Radiation Sterilization-Microbiological Methods-Part 2. In this sterility test, 100
samples after irradiated at the verification dose were inoculated with 200 ml soybean casein
liquid medium and incubated at 30±2°C for 14 days. The results were observed with no
growth. Sterilization studies of the tube were acceptable.
6. Detection Limit:
Microbial Recovery Studies:
Microbial recovery (viability) studies were conducted to support the claim of the Disposable
Urine Collection Tube for the collection, transport and preservation of urine specimens from
the collection site to the testing laboratory. Sample panels were prepared from the listed
bacteria and yeast (below) that were commonly associated with urinary tract infections.
Cultures from 1.5 × 108 (equivalent 0.5 McFarland standard) were diluted into the pooled
human negative clinical urine matrix to give a final concentration of 1.5 x 102 CFU/ml. The
appropriate volume of urine samples spiked with each organism was introduced into the
Disposable Urine Collection Tubes. Three lots of the Disposable Urine Collection Tubes
with three samples per lot were evaluated for the microbial recovery (viability) assay. The
inoculated sample tubes were initially tested to establish a time point zero then stored at 2-
4oC and 22-25oC for 24 hrs., and 48 hrs. After each storage time and temperature, the
samples were plated to grow colonies which were counted to determine CFU/ml for each
time points. According to CLSI document M40-A2, the acceptance criteria for microbial
recovery method was set to be within 1 log of the initial microorganism count. Results of
10
recovery studies are presented in table 2.

Fill Volume Impact Recovery Study:
A fill volume impact recovery study was performed to demonstrate that underfilling of
Disposable Urine Collection Tube containing preservative does not negatively impact the
viability of urine microorganism. Sample panels were prepared by listed microorganisms
(below) diluted from 1.5 x 108 CFU/mL (equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard) into the
pooled human urine matrix to give a final concentration of 1.5 x 102 CFU/ml. Three
production lots were tested in three replicates with each urine samples spiked with E. coli, P.
aeruginosa or P. mirabilis at the sample fill volume of 90% and 110%. The inoculated
sample tubes were initially tested to establish a time point zero then stored at 22-25oC for 48
hrs. After the storage time, the samples were plated to grow colonies which were counted to
determine CFU/ml for each time points. The acceptance criteria for the study is less than 1
log change when the fill volume is above or below the line. The results were shown in table
