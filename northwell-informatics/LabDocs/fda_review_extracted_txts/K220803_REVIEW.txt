IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GP Moxifloxacin has the following concentrations of Telavancin in the card:
0.25, 2 and 8 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The MIC
result range for the VITEK 2 AST-GP Telavancin is ≤0.25 to ≥8 µg/mL. For all species, the MIC
result range indicates that the VITEK 2 system is capable of producing the following MIC
results: ≤0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and ≥8 µg/mL for the AST Gram-Positive Moxifloxacin test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST Gram-Positive Moxifloxacin was conducted at
three external sites using a panel of twenty-five Gram positive organisms consistent with the
indications for use (i.e., six isolates of S. aureus, one isolate of S. epidermidis, thirteen
isolates of E. faecium, three isolates of E. faecalis and two isolates of E. casseliflavus). Each
isolate was tested in triplicate, using separate inocula, over three days for a total of 75 data
points. Inocula were prepared using both the autodilution and manual dilution methods for
testing with the VITEK 2 System. The mode of MIC values was determined for each isolate
and the reproducibility was calculated based on the number of MIC values that fell within ± 1
doubling dilution of the mode.
All MIC results were on-scale and within one doubling dilution from the modal MIC value;
therefore, only best-case results are reported. The testing resulted in an overall
reproducibility of 100% (75/75) when testing with the VITEK 2 System (autodilution and
manual dilution methods).
2. Linearity:
Not Applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Not Applicable
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not Applicable
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The CLSI recommended QC strains for moxifloxacin, E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus
ATCC 29213, were tested a sufficient number of time (i.e., at least 20 times/site) at each
testing site using both the VITEK 2 card and broth microdilution reference methods. Both the
automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 system.
In summary, QC organisms recommended by both the FDA and CLSI, namely E. faecalis
ATCC 29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213, were tested using the reference broth
microdilution (BMD) method and the VITEK 2 GP-AST Moxifloxacin during the clinical
study as summarized in Table 1. The overall QC results for both the reference and VITEK 2
were acceptable. The BMD dilution range (≤0.0625 - ≥16 μg/mL) covered the full expected
result range of E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (expected range of 0.06-0.5 µg/mL) and S. aureus
K220803 - Page 6 of 12

--- Page 7 ---
ATCC 29213 (expected range of 0.016-0.12 µg/mL); however, the VITEK 2 Moxifloxacin
card (≤0.25 - ≥8 μg/mL) resulted in off-scale MIC values for E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and S.
aureus ATCC 29213. An E. faecalis ATCC 29212 MIC value of ≤0.25 µg/mL (with VITEK
2) was considered as an indication that the quality control test results were acceptable. A S.
aureus ATCC 29213 MIC value of ≤0.0625 µg/mL (with BMD) and ≤0.25 µg/mL (with
VITEK 2) was considered as an indication that the quality control test results were
acceptable. To address the expected off-scale QC results when testing E. faecalis ATCC
29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213, the device labeling reviewed in the current submission
includes the following footnote under the Quality Control Table:
“Does not include the full CLSI/FDA recommended dilution range for QC testing with this
organism”.

1VITEK 2 Card range for Moxifloxacin is ≤0.25 - ≥8 μg/mL and does not include the full CLSI/FDA-
recommended dilution range for QC testing of E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and S.s aureus ATCC 29213. The
lowest concentration of the VITEK 2 Moxifloxacin MIC range is 0.25 µg/mL. Obtaining a value of ≤0.25
µg/mL was considered an indication that the quality control test results were acceptable. Similarly, the lowest
concentration of the BMD Moxifloxacin MIC range is 0.0625 µg/mL. Obtaining a value of ≤0.0625 µg/mL was
considered an indication that the quality control test results were acceptable.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The performance of the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Moxifloxacin was evaluated using
existing data collected in support of K032399 using the new interpretative criteria currently
recognized by FDA. Testing of moxifloxacin was performed at four external sites. Results
obtained with VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Moxifloxacin were compared to results obtained
with the CLSI agar dilution reference panel. The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 AST-
Gram Positive Moxifloxacin is ≤0.25 to ≥8 µg/mL for all species. The testing conditions for
the reference method consisted of the following:
• Medium: Cation Adjusted Mueller Hinton Agar
• Inoculum: 1 mL of organism suspension standardized to approximate a McFarland 0.5
standard
• Incubation: 35 ± 2°C; 16-20 hours
The VITEK 2 cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
and manual dilution method. All test inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the
reference method were standardized using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
For the current submission, additional testing was done to assess performance: 20 S.
epidermis clinical isolates. All testing was performed with the autodilution method at a single
external clinical site. A total of 457 clinical isolates were evaluated using the VITEK 2
autodilution method. Of these isolates, 89.7% were contemporary isolates (tested within
fourteen days from isolation) and 10.3% were stock isolates (no specific time from isolation).
A total of 73 challenge isolates were evaluated using VITEK 2 autodilution and manual
dilution methods.
K220803 - Page 8 of 12

--- Page 9 ---
The results obtained using the VITEK 2 autodilution and manual dilution methods of the
from the 530 total isolates (457 clinical isolates and 73 challenge isolates) are summarized in
Table 2. To support testing of E. faecalis using the VITEK 2 COMPACT system, the sponsor
provided COMPACT data from an equivalency study that evaluated E. faecalis challenge in
Levofloxacin and Norfloxacin which demonstrated acceptable essential agreement values.
The provided performance data of E. faecalis evaluated in the VITEK 2 Compact
equivalency study, in combination with the low risk assessment of the specified organism/
drug combination, was satisfactory to conclude that VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive
Moxifloxacin can be run on either the VITEK 2 system of the VITEK 2 Compact system
with an equivalent level of safety and effectiveness.

Trending
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the VITEK 2 autodilution method for each species. This trending calculation analyzes
device MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher
than the reference method. MIC values that are off-scale for both the reference and device are
not considered in the trending analysis. Species for which the difference between the
percentage of isolates with higher or lower MIC values was ≥ 30% with a statistically
significant confidence interval were considered to have evidence of trending and is addressed
in the labeling.

A trend toward higher MIC values was observed for E. faecalis and S. aureus (Table 3). To
address the observed trending, the following footnote was included by the sponsor to the
performance table in the device labeling:
VITEK 2 AST-GP Moxifloxacin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or
at least one doubling dilution higher when testing Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus
aureus compared to the CLSI reference agar dilution method.

IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GP Moxifloxacin when revised breakpoints for
telavancin are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the
telavancin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
