A Device Description:
VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen is designed to predict mecA-mediated oxacillin resistance in
Staphylococcus spp. The cefoxitin screen and oxacillin work in combination to determine the
final interpretation reported for oxacillin. The VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen is a
qualitative test based on the CLSI, “Disk Diffusion Test for Prediction of mecA mediated
resistance in Staphylococci.” The VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen test is intended for use
with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in
vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
The VITEK 2 card is inoculated with a standardized organism suspension, and growth inside the
card is optically monitored throughout the incubation cycle. Results are automatically calculated
once a predetermined growth threshold is reached and a report is generated that contains the MIC
result and the interpretive category result.
VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen has the following concentrations in the card: 4 and 5
μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL).
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 AST card is essentially a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique. Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which
contain only nutrient medium is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured
portions of antimicrobials combined with the nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to
a standardized concentration with 0.45% to 0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the
antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will automatically dilute the
bacterial suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then the VITEK 2 will fill,
seal and place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling,
sealing and loading operation.
The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time
(up to 24 hours for Streptococcus species). The analysis program determines when a well
demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is
used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial
agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated. For the VITEK 2
Cefoxitin Screen, the report will list either a positive or negative result. The VITEK 2 Cefoxitin
Screen and oxacillin work in combination to determine the final oxacillin interpretation based on
the CLSI recommendations.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen was conducted at three
clinical sites using a panel of ten Staphylococcus spp. (i.e., five S. aureus, three S.
epidermidis, one S. haemolyticus and one S. saprophyticus isolates). Each isolate was tested
in triplicate over three days for a total of 270 data points. Inocula were prepared using both
the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2 System. In
addition, the inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method for use with the VITEK 2
Compact. The data was analyzed as described in the Class II Special Controls Guidance
Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. The testing resulted in overall
reproducibility of 100% for each dilution method and VITEK 2 system, which is acceptable.

Quality Control (QC) Testing
The QC strains, namely Staphylococcus aureus BAA-1026 and Staphylococcus aureus
ATCC 29213, are not CLSI-recommended for routine QC for detection of methicillin
(oxacillin) resistance but have been evaluated and determined to be acceptable. Each QC
strain was tested a sufficient number of times (i.e., at least 20/site) at each testing site using
both the VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen Test and the CLSI test for detecting methicillin
(oxacillin) resistance with cefoxitin disk diffusion. Both the automatic dilution and manual
dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual dilution method was used for
the VITEK 2 Compact. The results are summarized in Table 1 below.

One ancillary quality control organism (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) was tested
throughout the comparative testing by Cefoxitin disk diffusion to perform further quality
control of the Cefoxitin disk. Expected QC results for the Cefoxitin disk diffusion method
were generated 100% (147/147) of the time.
Inoculum Density Control
The DensiCHEK Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a 0.5 McFarland standard.
The instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at each site. Calibration
values were within the expected range.
Purity Check
A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to prepare the
VITEK 2 card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in the study.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A clinical study was conducted at five clinical sites using the VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin
Screen. There were 739 clinical isolates and 75 challenge isolates tested for a total of 814
isolates. Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen Test were compared
to the qualitative values determined by the CLSI test for detecting methicillin (oxacillin)
resistance using cefoxitin disk diffusion as a surrogate test. The testing conditions for the
cefoxitin disk diffusion method consisted of the following:
• Medium – Mueller Hinton agar with Cefoxitin 30 μg disks
• Inoculum – Direct colony suspension
• Incubation – S. aureus and S. lugdunensis: 35°C ± 2°C; 16-18 hours. Other
Staphylococcus spp. (excluding S. pseudintermedius and S. scheiferi: 35°C ± 2°C; 24
hours (may be reported after 18 hours, if resistant)
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test inocula
used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the cefoxitin disk diffusion method were standardized
using the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 743 clinical Staphylococcus spp. isolates were evaluated at five sites: 66.2% were
considered contemporary isolates (isolated from clinical specimen and tested within 6
months) and 33.8% were stock isolates. Complete test results are available for 739 clinical
isolates (453 S. aureus, 13 S. capitis, 185 S. epidermidis, 19 S. haemolyticus, 20 S.
lugdunensis, 20 S. saprophyticus, 14 S. simulans and 15 S. warneri). All clinical isolates
were tested with the auto-dilution option of the VITEK 2.
A total of 75 challenge Staphylococcus spp. isolates (1 Coagulase negative staphylococcus,
55 S. aureus, 10 S. epidermidis, 4 S. haemolyticus, 4 S. lugdunensis, and 1 S. simulans) were
evaluated at one site. The challenge set was tested with the auto-dilution and manual dilution
options of the VITEK 2 and with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact.

Clinical and Challenge Data –VITEK 2 Auto-Dilution
VITEK 2 AST-GP Cefoxitin Screen performance was determined with 814 isolates (739
clinical isolates and 75 challenge isolates) by comparing VITEK 2 results with cefoxitin disk
diffusion results that were evaluated based on susceptibility testing interpretive criteria
(breakpoints) established for Staphylococcus spp. A final VITEK 2 result for oxacillin was
determined by comparison of the Cefoxitin Screen Test card result and the Oxacillin card
result using forcing rules. Oxacillin is forced susceptible for coagulase-negative
staphylococci (CoNS) other than S. lugdunensis and S. epidermidis when the oxacillin MIC
result is 0.5 – 2 µg/mL and the cefoxitin screen result is negative. This rule was used in the
final analysis of the result. After forcing, category agreement and error rates were calculated
using Cefoxitin disk diffusion as the comparator method.

There were six major errors (6/355 = ~1.7%) and one very major error (1/177 = ~0.6%). The
overall performance of other Staphylococci spp. is acceptable with a CA of 97.8%. There
were no very major errors and six major errors due to an increased major error rate observed
with S. capitis.
To address the performance issue noted above for S. capitis, the sponsor included the
following limitation in the device labeling:
Perform an alternative method of testing prior to reporting results when a Positive (+) result
is obtained with the following antibiotic/organism combination(s):
• Cefoxitin Screen Test (oxsf02n): Staphylococcus capitis
In addition to evaluating results obtained with Staphylococcus spp., 15 isolates of S. simulans
were tested with the auto-dilution method. However, performance of cefoxitin screen with
this species was not acceptable. The following limitation was added to the device labeling:
