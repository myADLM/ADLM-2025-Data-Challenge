B Indication(s) for Use:
The SQA-iO Sperm Quality Analyzer is an automated point-of-care in vitro use only medical
device for semen analysis performed by healthcare professionals (trained lab technicians). The
SQA-iO does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of a male’s fertility status.
The SQA-iO provides direct and calculated quantitative measurements for the following
parameters:
Directly measured parameters:
• Sperm Concentration, M/mL
• Motile Sperm Concentration (MSC), M/mL
• Progressively Motile Sperm Concentration (PMSC), M/mL (combines Rapid and Slow
PMSC, millions/mL)
• Normal Forms (Normal Morphology), %
Calculated parameters:
• Total Motility (PR + NP), %
• Progressive Motility (PR), % (combines Rapidly and Slowly Progressive Motility, %)
• Non-Progressive Motility (NP), %
• Immotile (IM), %
• Functional Sperm Concentration (FSC), millions/mL
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The SQA-iO is a PC-based POC automated device that tests human semen samples, using a
cloud-based application for device control, data analysis, and data storage. The SQA-iO utilizes
proprietary software code to both perform analysis of semen parameters and to present those
results on the user interface. It provides direct and calculated measurements for total sperm
concentration, percent motility, percent immotile, percent progressive (rapid and slow) motility,
percent non-progressive motility, percent normal forms, motile sperm concentration, progressive
motile sperm concentration (rapid and slow), and functional sperm concentration.
The SQA-iO package provides all the supplies necessary to perform semen analysis: SQA-iO
device, USB cable, SQA disposable capillaries, and a cleaning kit.
The cleaning kit includes the following components:
• Long cleaning brush
• Fibrous material cleaning paddles (single use)
• Sponge-tipped drying paddles (single use)
K220828 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
• Cleaning fluid (50% Ethanol, 49.5% Distilled Water, 0.5% Tween 20) (single drop
dispenser)
B Principle of Operation:
After collection and preparation, 0.6 mL of semen sample is manually aspirated into a disposable
SQA capillary sample delivery system and inserted into the SQA-iO measurement chamber. The
testing process takes approximately 75 seconds. The system performs an automatic self-test and
auto-calibration upon start up, and checks device stability before each sample is run. The SQA-
iO software analyzes semen parameters using signal processing technology. Sample testing is
performed by capturing electrical signals as sperm moves through a light source in the SQA-iO
optical block. These light disturbances are converted into electrical signals which are then
analyzed by the SQA-iO software. The SQA-iO software applies proprietary algorithms to
interpret and express these electrical signals and report them as various semen parameters.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
SQA-iO Sperm Quality Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is manually entered in the ‘Test Patient’ field of the software, prior
to sample analysis.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A minimum of 0.6 ml of semen is required. Sample should be self-collected without using
lubricants or other cremes. The sample should be maintained at room temperature (do not
heat or refrigerate), tested Fresh (within 1 hour of collection) and be fully liquified.
4. Calibration:
Internal electronic Self-Test/Auto-Calibration runs at start-up. Reference values verified prior
to each test.
5. Quality Control:
QwikCheck Beads (cleared under K041600) are used for performing quality control. The
three levels should be analyzed every 24-hours or prior to sample analysis.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability
Eight native donor samples, spanning low, middle and high levels of five parameters
(concentration, motility, MSC, PMSC, and morphology), were assayed in duplicate on five
devices over four time-points. Due to the limited stability of semen samples, each “day” in
the statistical analysis represented different times of day with testing at the 0, 20, 40, and 60-
minute time points resulting in 40 replicate results per sample, for each of the five
parameters. Standard deviations (SDs) and percent coefficients of variation (%CVs) were
calculated for each sample. The results were found to be acceptable.

Reproducibility
This study was designed to establish the reproducibility of the SQA-iO utilizing three levels
of QwikCheck beads (controls) assayed by three different operators in three locations over a
5-day period. Six replicates of each level of QwikCheck Beads, representing varying
concentration levels (High, Normal and Negative) were included. For each level of control
sample, the mean, SD and %CV were calculated, along with the %CV for repeatability and
reproducibility (total precision). The results were found to be acceptable.
2. Linearity:
Linearity of SQA-iO device was evaluated for sperm concentration only using three
analyzers with one replicate per analyzer. Semen samples were prepared by pooling ten
native donors and concentrating sperm via centrifugation and removal of supernatant. The
cell pellet was resuspended in Earle’s buffer to create high concentration stock, which was
serial diluted to prepare nine linearity samples total. At each level, the mean of the three
replicates was calculated, and regression analysis was used to verify the linear range. Sperm
concentration was demonstrated to be linear from 2–400 M/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The potential interference of various substances on SQA-iO results were evaluated by using
two sperm concentration levels (15–60 M/mL and 100–200 M/mL). The parameters of sperm
concentration, MSC, PMSC, and %normal morphology were evaluated. The following 11
interfering substances were tested in the study at the recommended level: vitamin B,
testosterone, yeast, E. Coli, red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), urine, saliva,
agglutination of semen sample, D-norgestrel, and β-estradiol. Samples were compared to
matched native control samples (no interferent added, only seminal plasma to compensate for
volume). Results showed that all tested interfering substances met the acceptance criteria, so
no significant interference was caused by the tested substances at the evaluated level.
4. Accuracy (Instrument):
Method comparison
Method comparison data were based on comparative testing of 165 matched native semen
samples that were assayed on the SQA-iO and the predicate SQA-V device across three sites.
At each site, one SQA-iO device and one SQA-V device were used. Each sample was

C Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Sample Stability:
This study was performed to demonstrate the stability of semen parameters. In this study,
samples were held at room temperature and the parameters of sperm concentration,
%morphology, % motility, MSC and PMSC were assessed at various time intervals, and
results were compared to their initial (T0) results. The study results support the
recommendations to perform semen analysis within 1 hour of collection with samples held at
room temperature prior to analysis.
2. Detection Limit:
A study was conducted to determine the detection limits of Sperm Concentration analyzed on
the SQA-iO Sperm Quality Analyzer. Blank seminal plasma was used to represent a
surrogate for the blank sample. Low level semen samples were prepared by pooling ten
native donors and concentrating sperm via centrifugation and removal of supernatant. The
cell pellet was resuspended in seminal plasma and diluted to create low concentration
samples. Results were calculated and the detection limits were determined to be:
Limit of Blank (LoB) = 0 M/mL
Limit of Detection (LoD) = 1.73 M/mL
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) = 5.96 M/mL
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
