IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The EnTM Collection and Transport System medium consists of a polypropylene conical tube
filled with 2 ml of the transport medium (pale brown to red color medium solution), affixed with
a polyethylene screw cap. The bottom part of the tube has a self-standing shape. Tubes are
provided in a paper rack. The media tubes can be provided with one or two kinds of sterile
specimen collection swabs, one for oropharyngeal (OP) oral use and the other nasopharyngeal
(NP) for nasal use. The swab shaft is polystyrene with a breaking point, and the swab tip is
flocked nylon fibers. The media is provided in two different configurations with and without the
sterile peel pouch containing swabs as shown below:

B Principle of Operation:
The EnTM Collection and Transport System is an osmotically balanced and buffered medium
that contains Hank’s balanced salt solution. Also, the medium contains a pH indicator, a protein
stabilizer, sucrose as a preservative and antibiotics to prevent contamination from bacteria or
fungi. The EnTM Collection and Transport System is used to safely collect and transport upper

health care professionals.
After collecting a specimen using the swab, the swab is placed into the uncapped polypropylene
tube filled with 2 mL of the transport medium, the swab shaft is broken off at the breakpoint by
hand and the tube is capped closed. The swab specimen can be stored in the collection medium
for up to 48 hours at 4°C. The swab specimen is ready for use in diagnostic to determine the
presence of a target pathogen. Sample collection is performed by health care professionals.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Shelf-life stability: The shelf life for the EnTM Collection and Transport System was
determined to be 12 months from the date of manufacture when stored at temperatures 25℃.
The shelf life of the EnTM Collection and Transport Medium was evaluated using real-time
aging performance test.
Physical Stability: Physical stability was evaluated by Appearance, UV spectrum analysis
(Scan: absorbance at 250-800 nm), and pH measurement at time points T = 0, 6, and 12
months using three lots stored at 25℃. The appearance was evaluated by inspecting visually
to examine for a red and clear solution (translucent with no turbidity). Appearance results
were acceptable for all lots at all storage times. To detect any physical changes in the media,
UV Spectrum analysis was conducted by setting the wavelength range to 250-800 nm (scan).
The UV spectrum scanning analysis for 250-800 nm produced similar results for all lots at all
storage times. Absorbance at 290 nm was also measured for any physical changes and results
showed no changes and produced similar results for all lots at all storage times. For pH
measurement study, all the transport media demonstrated pH level within 7.4±1 for all lots at
all storage times.
Sterility test: The EnTM Collection and Transport System is not claimed to be sterile nor is it
intended to be sterilized by the end user. To reduce contamination, the screw-cap tube is
sterilized by irradiation with a maximum dose of 40 kGy using the E-beam irradiation
process. A check for possible contamination was conducted by transferring transport media
to growth medium Thioglycolate and incubated 35oC for 3 days, and in Tryptic Soy Broth at
25oC for 5 days and examined for growth turbidity. No bacterial or fungal proliferation was
detected at either condition tested.
No testing was performed at lower than 25oC. Even though additional testing was conducted
at higher temperatures (40oC), the data was not required, and no claim was granted but the
data supported stability at 12 months. The shelf-life study report supports the stability of the
EnTM Collection and Transport System at room temperature 25°C for 12 months.

6. Detection Limit:
Viral Recovery:
Culture-Based Viral Recovery Study: Performance of the EnTM Collection and Transport
System media was evaluated for virus viability at refrigerated temperatures (4 °C). Three lots
of VTM with newly manufactured, middle-aged lot and close to expiry lots were used to
evaluate viral recovery (ENTM-22001, ENTM-22003, and ENTM-23001). Influenza A
(California/07/2009 H1N1, NCCP 42467), Human coronavirus 229E (Zeptometrix
0810229CF), and Human respiratory syncytial virus type A (type A strain Long, ATCC VR-
26) were used for the viral recovery study. Each virus was diluted in pooled negative
nasopharyngeal matrix transferred to the collection swab and then added to the Viral
Transport Media. Aliquots of each replicate were stored at 4°C for 0, 24, and 48 hours. Host
cells (MDCK for Influenza A, MRC-5 for Human coronavirus, and HEp-2 for Human
respiratory syncytial virus type A) were plated for 1 day. At each timepoint the viral samples
from EnTM were serially diluted and inoculated onto the host cell-line and cultured in a 96
well plate. The plates were incubated at 37°C and viral CPE was observed after 4-5 days.
Viral titer was determined by the Reed-Muench method calculation of TCID (50% tissue
50
culture infective dose).
Results were considered acceptable if the average viral titer demonstrates any percent
changes within ±90% (i.e.,1 log change). The results are presented in the Table 1. Any
changes in the viral titer in the timepoints was shown as percent changes and negative
percent change indicates reduction.

EnTM Collection and Transport System media demonstrated the recovery of viruses at 4˚C
storage when evaluated for 48 hrs. in all replicates of tested viral strains (Influenza A, Human
