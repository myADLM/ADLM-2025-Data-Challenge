IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys CMV IgG assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin
microparticles, biotinylated recombinant CMV-specific antigen labeled with a ruthenium
complex and electrochemiluminescence detection. The results are determined using a calibration
curve which is instrument-specifically generated by a 2-point calibration and a master curve
provided via the reagent bar code. Results greater than or equal to 1.0 COI are considered
reactive CMV IgG antibody. The test system contains the human serum-based calibrators
intended for use with the system.
The Elecsys PreciControl CMV IgG contains liquid control serum based on human serum. The
controls are used for monitoring the accuracy of the Elecsys CMV IgG immunoassay.
Reagents and calibrators are packaged together in the Elecsys CMV IgG assay kit, while the
associated PreciControl is packaged separately.
The following Reagents are provided in the Elecsys CMV IgG assay kit:
1. The reagent rackpack consists of reagents: M, R1, and R2 and is labeled as CMVIGG:
- M: Streptavidin-coated microparticles (transparent cap), 1 bottle, 6.5 mL:
Streptavidin-coated microparticles 0.72 mg/mL; preservatives: MIT (0.1%) and

• 1st incubation: 12 μL of sample, biotinylated recombinant CMV‑specific antigens, and
CMV‑specific recombinant antigens labeled with a ruthenium complexa) form a sandwich
complex.
• 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex
becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin.

• The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then
removed with ProCell II M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces
chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
• Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument specifically generated
by 2‑point calibration and a master curve provided via the cobas link.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable since this is not a quantitative assay.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To evaluate the effect of elevated levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, intralipid, total protein and
rheumatoid factor on the CMV IgG assay, six CMV IgG samples (2 negative, 2 near cutoff
and 2 positive) were spiked with the potential interferents. Each interferent was evaluated at
11 different concentrations. Samples containing hemoglobin, bilirubin, intralipid, total
protein, and rheumatoid factor were tested in duplicate on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer with an
acceptance criterion of ± 15 % Please refer to the interfering substances testing in K131605.
Biotin interference testing was performed with multiple samples of increasing biotin
concentrations using an acceptance criterion of ± 10 %.
The results of the biotin interference testing are presented in the following table with the
maximum test concentration that does not interfere with the results of the Elecsys CMV IgG
test:

Interferent tested No interference up to
Hemoglobin ≤ 0.623 mmol/L or ≤ 1.0 g/dL

b. Reagent Stability:
Roche conducted the following reagent stability studies to determine changes to the
stability of the biotin updated Elecsys CMV IgG assay:
- On board Reagent Stability: The on-board stability of the reagents were assessed in
this study with one lot on the cobas e 801 analyzer. The study was conducted with a
panel that consisted of five human serum samples (negative, below cut-off,
borderline, above cut-off, positive) and PreciControl PC0, PC1 and PC2. Each panel
member was tested in duplicates. Samples were measured with reagent kits of one lot
on day 0 (reference value with fresh reagents), and upon storage of the reagent kit at
10 °C +/- 2°C onboard of the instrument for 35, 63, 91, 112 and 119 days (5, 9, 13, 16
and 17 weeks). Re-calibration was performed at every measuring time point. The
study results met the following criteria and thus supports a claim of 16 weeks at on-
board temperature of 10 °C +/- 2°C:
Concentration Deviation/Recovery
0.25 COI to ≤ 1.0 COI ± 0.2 COI
> 1.0 COI ≤ ± 20 %
- Calibration Stability: The calibration stability of the reagents were assessed in this
study with one lot of calibrators on the cobas e 801 analyzer. The study was
conducted with a panel that consisted of five human serum samples (negative, below
cut-off, borderline, above cut-off, positive) and PreciControl PC0, PC1 and PC2.
Each panel member was tested in duplicates at each timepoint. Samples were tested at
day 0 (reference value with new reagents, stored refrigerated at 2-8°C) and then
assessed for their stability at day 35, 63, 84 and 91 of open reagents stored at 2-8°C
during the entire test period. The median sample COI was calculated and evaluated on
the basis of recovery (absolute or percentage) relative to the median of the test
samples with fresh reagents (reference). The study results met the following criteria
and thus supports a calibration stability claim for 12 weeks when stored at 2-8°C:
Concentration Deviation/Recovery
0.25 COI to ≤ 1.0 COI ± 0.15 COI
> 1.0 COI ≤ ± 15 %

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The equivalence of the current and biotin-updated Elecsys CMV IgG assay was evaluated by
a method comparison study. A total of 280 samples were measured with one lot of the
current Elecsys CMV IgG assay and 3 lots of the biotin-updated Elecsys CMV IgG assay.
Testing was conducted with the cobas e 801 analyzer at one site.
Native clinical and contrived samples were tested in this study to adequately represent the
measuring range of the Elecsys CMV IgG assay. Contrived samples were derived from
diluting individual positive samples with individual negative clinical samples for
concentrations that were not adequately represented by native clinical samples. Sample
concentrations were as follows:
• 80 samples - < 0.5 COI,
• 31 samples were between 0.5 to < 1.0 COI
• 69 samples were between 1.0 – 3.0 COI
• 100 samples were > 3.0 COI
