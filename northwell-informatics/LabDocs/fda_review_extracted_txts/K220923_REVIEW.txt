III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
Immunoassay for the in vitro qualitative determination of IgG class antibodies to HSV-1 in
human serum and lithium heparin plasma, K2 EDTA plasma, and K3 EDTA plasma. The test is
intended for sexually active individuals and expectant mothers as an aid in the presumptive
diagnosis of HSV-1 infection. The test results may not determine the state of active lesions or
associated disease manifestations, particularly for primary infection. The predictive value of
positive and negative results depends on the population's prevalence and the pretest likelihood of
HSV-1.
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on cobas e
immunoassay analyzers.
This test is not FDA cleared for screening blood or plasma donors.
The performance of this assay has not been established for use in a pediatric population,
neonates, immunocompromised patients, or for use at point of care facilities.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as Intended use
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use with cobas e 411
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys HSV-1 IgG immunoassay makes use of a sandwich test principle using biotinylated
recombinant HSV-1-specific antigens and HSV-1-specific recombinant antigens labeled with a
ruthenium complex. The Elecsys HSV-1 IgG immunoassay is intended for the qualitative
determination of IgG class antibodies to HSV‑1 in human serum and plasma to aid in the
presumptive diagnosis of HSV‑1 infection. It is intended for use on the cobas e immunoassay
analyzers.
Results are determined automatically by the software by comparing the
electrochemiluminescence signal obtained from the reaction product of the sample with the
signal of the cutoff value previously obtained by calibration.
Interpretation of the results:
The cutoff for the Elecsys HSV-1 IgG assay was initially established by measuring a total of 269
serum samples from two cohorts: sexually active adults and pregnant women. The distribution of
positive and negative results were compared with the predicate assay, an FDA-cleared
K220923 - Page 2 of 8

--- Page 3 ---
immunoblot. The cutoff was set as noted below. The result of a sample is given in the form of a
cutoff index (signal sample/cutoff).
Results obtained with the Elecsys HSV-1 IgG assay are interpreted as follows:
Non-reactive: < 1.0 COI
Reactive: ≥ 1.0 COI
Samples with a cutoff index < 1.0 are non-reactive in the Elecsys HSV-1 IgG assay. These
samples are considered negative for HSV-1 IgG-specific antibodies and do not need further
testing.
Samples with a cutoff index ≥ 1.0 are considered reactive in the Elecsys HSV-1 IgG assay.
The HSV-1 IgG results for a given specimen, as determined by assays from different
manufacturers, can vary due to differences in reagents and assay methods.
If control results are out of their specified range, no patient results should be reported.
B Principle of Operation:
Sandwich principle. Total duration of assay: 18 minutes.
▪ 1st incubation: 20 µL of sample, biotinylated recombinant HSV-1-specific antigens, and
HSV-1-specific recombinant antigens labeled with a ruthenium complexa) form a sandwich
complex.
▪ 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex becomes bound
to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
▪ The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed
with ProCell. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission
which is measured by a photomultiplier.
▪ Results are determined automatically by the software by comparing the
electrochemiluminescence signal obtained from the reaction product of the sample with the signal
of the cutoff value previously obtained by calibration.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a. Repeatability and intermediate precision studies:
Precision was determined on the cobas e 411 analyzer using Elecsys reagents and controls in
a protocol (EP05-A3) of the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute). Results were
generated from 5 human serum samples (covering a range of negative, near cut-off, and
positive values), and 2 controls assayed in 2 runs per day in duplicate each for 21 days
(n=84). The following results were obtained:

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Potential interference of the analyte in the presence of biotin using the updated Elecsys HSV-
1 IgG assay was determined by testing three serum samples (negative, near cut-off, positive)
on the cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer. One aliquot of each sample was spiked with the
interfering substance (biotin) and another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of the
respective solvent (dilution pool). The interfering pool was then incrementally diluted into
