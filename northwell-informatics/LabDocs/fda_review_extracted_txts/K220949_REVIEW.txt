Table 3. Results and Interpretation
Result AU/mL Interpretation
< 6.0 Nonreactive for anti-CMV IgG.
Individuals with such results are presumed to be not infected with CMV
and susceptible to primary infection.
6.0 to < 15.0 Grayzone/Equivocal
It is recommended to confirm results of specimens with concentration
values between 6.0 and < 15.0 AU/mL using a CMV IgM test or draw a
second sample, if possible, within a reasonable period of time (e.g., 2
weeks) to repeat ARCHITECT CMV IgG testing.
≥ 15.0 Reactive for anti-CMV IgG.
Reactivity for anti-CMV IgG indicates past or acute infection. Such
individuals are potentially at risk of transmitting CMV infection but are
not necessarily currently contagious.
B Principle of Operation:
This assay is an automated, two-step immunoassay for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies
to CMV (anti-CMV IgG) in human serum and plasma using chemiluminescent microparticle
immunoassay (CMIA) technology.
Pre-diluted sample, CMV virus lysate (strain AD169) coated paramagnetic microparticles, and
assay diluent are combined and incubated. The anti-CMV IgG present in the sample binds to the
CMV virus lysate (strain AD169) coated microparticles. The mixture is washed. Murine anti-
human IgG acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture and incubated.
Following a wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are added.
The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit (RLU).
The presence or absence of anti-CMV IgG in the sample is determined by comparing the
chemiluminescent RLU in the reaction to the cutoff RLU determined from an active calibration.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the precision performance of the ARCHITECT CMV
IgG assay. In addition, this study evaluated the acceptability of a calibration generated using the
ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay and stored on the ARCHITECT i2000SR System for a minimum
of 31 days. Precision was performed based on guidance from the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP05-A3. The following samples were tested, Table 4:

Panel 5 (Moderate Reactive) Recalcified Plasma 38.2 AU/mL
Panel 6 (High Reactive) Recalcified Plasma 193.9 AU/mL
Testing was performed using 1 instrument, 3 Reagent lots, 3 Calibrator lots, and 3 Control lots.
Each reagent lot was paired with a different lot of calibrators and controls. A calibration per
reagent lot was performed on the instrument by testing the calibrators in replicates of 2.
The samples were tested in a minimum of 2 replicates (from separate sample cups),
2 times per day (separated by a minimum of 2 hours), on at least 20 different days, for a
minimum of 80 required measurements.
Note: Three replicates per run were tested for each sample and therefore, the total number of
measurements in may be up to 120 measurements.
The nonreactive panel was CMV IgG negative human plasma. The high nonreactive panel (Panel
2), grayzone/equivocal panel (Panel 3), low reactive panel (Panel 4), moderate reactive panel
(Panel 5), and high reactive panel (Panel 6) were prepared by diluting recalcified CMV IgG

Of the 989 specimens included in the ARCHITECT CMV IgG clinical study, 791 were from the
intended use population in the US. Of the 791 specimens, 591 (74.7%) were routine order (325
female and 266 male, 0 to 91 years old) and 200 (25.3%) were pregnant females (19 to 45 years
old). The mean age across the 791 subjects was 40 years.
The ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay was reactive in 508 (64.2%) of the collected specimens in the
intended use population in the US (n = 791). Testing of the specimens was performed at 3
clinical testing sites located in Indianapolis Indiana, Lewisville Texas, and Palo Alto California.

Data obtained from 530 specimens used in the OUS ARCHITECT CMV IgG verification
study was used to confirm that the cutoff from the original Abbott AxSYM CMV IgG would
maintain assay sensitivity in the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay. Each sample was tested
using all 3 reagent lots, on both the OUS ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay and the Abbott
AxSYM CMV IgG assay (1590 samples total). AxSYM was utilized as truth. It was
determined that an implementation of a lower decision limit of 6 AU/mL with an upper

decision limit of 15 AU/mL was necessary based on this internal data for the OUS
ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay. The cutoff was validated in the clinical studies performed in
the US to support the substantial equivalence determination of the ARCHITECT CMV IgG
assay to the predicate device.
Nonreactive: < 6.0 AU/mL
Grayzone/Equivocal: 6.0 to <15.0 AU/mL
Reactive: ≥ 15.0 AU/mL
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A clinical study (method comparison) was performed in the US based on guidance from CLSI
EP12-A2, 2nd ed. to evaluate the percent agreement between the ARCHITECT CMV IgG
investigational assay and a current, FDA-cleared, commercially available anti-CMV IgG assay
with routine order specimens collected in the US (n = 591) and outside of the US ( n= 198) and
specimens collected from pregnant females in the US (n = 200).
Further evaluation of 4 specimens (3 from routine order and 1 from pregnant females) with an
equivocal/grayzone result by comparator assay was performed with 2 additional current, FDA-
cleared, commercially available anti-CMV IgG assays.
Clinical Testing Sites
There were three testing sites in California, Indiana, and Texas. Testing with the ARCHITECT
CMV IgG assay was performed using 3 ARCHITECT i2000SR instruments (one at each external
clinical testing site). Three lots of ARCHITECT CMV IgG Reagents, 2 lots of ARCHITECT
CMV IgG Calibrators, and 1 lot of ARCHITECT CMV IgG Controls were used at each of the 3
external clinical testing sites. Comparator testing using the FDA cleared assay was performed at
Site 1 only.
Results
Results were interpreted per the package insert for each assay and are shown in the following
table:

b Two routine order specimens were from pregnant females and therefore, were also included in the pregnant female
category.
c Of the 3 specimens that were nonreactive by ARCHITECT CMV IgG and equivocal/grayzone by comparator
assay, 2 were negative and 1 was equivocal/grayzone by consensus testing. One specimen that was concordant
equivocal/grayzone by ARCHITECT CMV IgG and comparator assay was negative by consensus testing.
d One specimen from pregnant females that was concordant grayzone/equivocal by ARCHITECT CMV IgG and
comparator assay was negative based on the consensus result from the comparator assay and 2 additional current,
FDA-cleared, commercially available anti-CMV IgG assays.
One Centers for Disease Conctrol and Prevention (CDC) CMV IgG human serum panel,
comprised of 80 samples that are either CMV IgG negative or CMV IgG positive, was obtained
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and tested using the ARCHITECT
CMV IgG assay. The results were submitted to the CDC. The CDC added their result
interpretation for each sample.
The percent (%) agreement values of the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay relative to the CDC
results were calculated. The positive % agreement and corresponding two-sided 95% CI was
100% (91.59%, 100%). The negative % agreement and corresponding two-sided 95% CI was
92.11% (78.62%, 98.34%). The overall % agreement and corresponding two-sided 95% CI was
96.25% (89.43%, 99.22%).
The results are presented as a means to convey further information on the performance of this
assay with a masked, characterized serum panel. This does not imply endorsement of the assay
by the CDC.
3. Matrix Comparison:
Samples were obtained from a specimen vendor from a minimum of 40 donors (at least 20 CMV IgG
negative and 20 CMV IgG positive donors) in the control tube type (serum, plastic) and in the
following evaluation tube types:
Table 15. Tube Types for Matrix Comparison Study
Evaluation Tube Types
Serum separator, plastic (SSP)
Lithium heparin (LIH)
Lithium heparin plasma separator
(PST)
Tripotassium EDTA (TED)
For each donor set, the mean concentration was calculated for the control tube type.
For each donor set, the difference between the evaluation tube first replicate concentration and
the control tube mean concentration was calculated using the following equation:
Difference = Evaluation Tube First Replicate – Control Tube Mean
For each donor set, the percent (%) difference was calculated using the following equation:
% Difference = Difference x 100

Control Tube Mean
The mean of the differences/% differences across donors and the two-sided 95% CI across
donors are summarized by analyte level and tube type
The tube types under evaluation were considered acceptable if, when compared to the control
tube type, the mean difference in measured CMV IgG concentration were
• ≤ + 0.6 AU/mL for samples with concentrations less than 6.0 AU/mL,
• ≤ + 1.5 AU/mL for samples with concentrations between 6.0 AU/mL and less
than 15.0 AU/mL, and
• ≥ -10% for samples with concentrations greater than or equal to 15.0 AU/mL.
All tube types tested met the evaluation criteria and are suitable for use with the ARCHITECT
CMV IgG assay.
