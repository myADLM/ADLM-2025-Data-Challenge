C Type of Test:
Real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) system, qualitative
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct is a real-time RT-PCR assay
intended for use on the LIAISON MDX instrument for the in vitro qualitative detection and
differentiation of nucleic acid from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2), influenza A virus and influenza B virus in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from
individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection.
The Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct assay is intended for use as an aid in the differential
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B infection. Negative results do not
preclude SARS-CoV-2, influenza A or influenza B infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for patient management decisions. Positive results do not rule out coinfections with other
organisms. Results should be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and
epidemiological information.
The Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct assay is intended for use by qualified and trained
clinical laboratory personnel specifically instructed and trained in the techniques of real-time
PCR and in vitro diagnostic procedures.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
LIAISON MDX instrument with LIAISON MDX Studio Software
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The system consists of the Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B assay reagents (supplied in quantity
for 24 reactions), the LIAISON MDX (with LIAISON MDX Studio Software), the Direct
Amplification Disc and associated accessories. The LIAISON MDX instrument is a real-time
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) thermocycler used for the identification of nucleic acid from
biological specimens. The Direct Amplification Disc (DAD) is compartmentalized into eight
separate wedges and up to eight separate specimens or controls may be processed on each disc.
K220963 - Page 2 of 24

--- Page 3 ---
Each wedge contains sample and reagent input wells, microfluidic channels and laser activated
valves to control the fluid flow, and a reaction chamber. The user adds 50 μL of Reaction Mix to
the reagent input well and 50 μL of unextracted specimen to the sample input well. The reverse
transcription, amplification and detection are performed automatically by the instrument.
B Principle of Operation:
The Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct assay system is a real-time RT-PCR system that
enables the direct amplification, detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, human
influenza A (Flu A) virus RNA and human influenza B (Flu B) virus RNA from unprocessed
nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) that have not undergone nucleic acid extraction. The system
consists of the Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct assay, the LIAISON MDX (with
LIAISON MDX Studio Software), the Direct Amplification Disc and associated accessories.
In the Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct assay, fluorescent probes are used together with
corresponding forward and reverse primers to amplify SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B and internal
control RNA targets. For COVID-19 detection, the assay targets two different regions specific to
the SARS-CoV-2 genome; the S gene which encodes the spike glycoprotein and the ORF1ab
region which encodes wellconserved non-structural proteins and therefore is less susceptible to
recombination. For Flu detection the assay targets conserved regions of influenza A viruses
(matrix gene) and influenza B viruses (matrix gene). The assay provides three results; COVID-
19 (ORF1ab and/or S gene detection), influenza A viruses (matrix gene detection) and influenza
B viruses (matrix gene detection). An RNA internal control is used to detect RT-PCR failure
and/or inhibition.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Liaison MDX System
2. Specimen Identification:
Barcode scanner or manual entry
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct is a no extraction RT-PCR assay. The operator adds
50 μL of unextracted sample to the sample input well and adds 50 μL of the reaction mix to
the reagent input well in the direct amplification disc (DAD).
4. Calibration:
Each reagent kit comes with a barcode card, which contains assay specific parameters and lot
information. The barcode card is scanned prior to each run.

VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:
Class II Special Controls as per 21 CFR 866.3981
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Analytical Reactivity:
The analytical reactivity of the Simplexa COVID-19 & A/B Direct with various strains of
influenza A, influenza B and SARS-CoV-2, was evaluated by testing dilutions of quantified
virus stocks prepared by spiking into pooled negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix (swabs
collected in UTM) at concentrations near the LoD. A total of 63 Flu A strains, 21 Flu B
strains and five SARS-CoV-2 strains were tested in three replicates. Samples that were not
detected in all three replicates at the initially contrived concentrations were retested at a
higher concentration. Tables 2, 3, and 4 below show the strains that were positive in all three
replicates at the concentrations shown.

Inclusivity (in silico)
An in silico inclusivity analysis of the assay oligo sequences for SARS-CoV-2 was
performed against SARS-CoV-2 sequences available in the GISAID EpiCoV database
submitted from May 01, 2022 to July 31, 2022, including sequences of the Omicron
BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. The analysis included 211, 224 sequences
in the amplicon regions of the ORF1ab and S gene oligo sets. Only target sequences with full
coverage of all three oligo-binding regions (forward primer, reverse primer, and probe) are
included in the analyses for both oligo sets. In this sequence set, there are 208, 582 (~98.7%)
sequences with no mismatches in the oligo binding regions for both genes, 2602 (~1.2%)
sequences with no mismatches for one gene oligo set (either ORF1ab or S gene), and 40
(~0.02%) sequences with mismatches in at least one oligo binding region for both gene oligo
sets. Based on in silico analysis of the percent homology between assay oligos and target
sequences, potential impact of location of the mismatches on extension and/or binding, and
the mismatch melt temperature (Tm) values of the oligo sequence to its binding region on
each analyzed SARS-CoV-2 sequence, it is predicted that the assay will detect 100% of the
211,224 SARS-CoV-2 sequences, including sequences of all defined variants of concern or
variants of interest, available in the GISAID EpiCoV database from May 01, 2022 to July 31,
2022.
An additional in silico inclusivity analysis of the oligonucleotide (oligo) sequences for the
SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab and S gene sets were performed against all SARS-CoV-2 sequences
(Human host, Complete, High Coverage) submitted to the GISAID EpiCoV database from
November 1, 2022 to February 8, 2023. Based on in silico inclusivity analysis of the SARS-
CoV-2 oligo sequences of both gene oligo sets, it is predicted that 100% of analyzed
sequences (n = 12,378) can be detected by the assay.
For Influenza A, in silico inclusivity analysis was performed using human host sequences
available from the GISAID EpiFlu database and collected between November 1, 2022 and
February 8, 2023. Based on in silico inclusivity analysis of the Influenza A oligos, it is
predicted that the assay can detect ~99% (n = 9150) of all human host Influenza A sequences
collected between November 1, 2022 and February 8, 2023.
2. Precision/Reproducibility:
The device was evaluated in a reproducibility study testing a panel of eight samples. The
panel members were prepared by diluting viral stocks of influenza A, influenza B and SARS-
CoV-2 strains into pooled negative clinical matrix (NP swabs collected in UTM). The panel
included a Low Positive (2x LoD) and a Moderate Positive (4x LoD) level for each virus; a
Positive Control and a negative sample consisting of UTM (no-template control) were also
included.

The study was conducted at two external and one internal testing sites with each site having
two designated LIAISON MDX instruments and two dedicated operators. Each of the two
operators used a unique lot of the reaction mix (for a total of two lots). Each panel member
was tested in three replicates, in two runs per day, over five days, at three locations. A total
of 90 measurements (3 replicates x 2 runs/day x 5 days x 3 sites) were generated for each
panel member. The study design allowed for evaluation of multiple components of variance.
The data was assessed for (a) qualitative results, i.e., percent agreement with expected
results, and (b) quantitative analysis of variance components, i.e., average Ct values and
calculated SD and %CV.

confounded variables.
3. Linearity:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative test.
4. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity
The Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct assay’s analytical specificity was evaluated in a
study testing samples containing organisms that are present as normal flora in
nasopharyngeal passages and those that cause similar clinical symptoms as influenza A,
influenza B and/or SARS-CoV-2. Forty-four different pathogens including bacteria, viruses
and one fungus were included in the study, with each organism tested in three replicates. No
cross reactivity was observed with the organisms at the concentrations tested, as shown
below.

Competitive Interference
The performance of the Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct assay was evaluated for its
ability to accurately detect influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 in cases of co-infection
with the assay’s target organisms. Baseline samples were prepared by spiking COVID-
19/USA-WA1/2020, Influenza A/Hong Kong/8/1968 or Influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 at 4x
LoD into nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) matrix in UTM. A high level (1,000x LoD) of each of
the viruses was added to each of the baseline samples and tested. No interference was
observed for the target analytes in the presence of potentially competing co-infection analytes
at the concentrations and combinations tested.

Microbial Interference
The performance of the Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct assay was evaluated for its
ability to accurately detect influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of
other clinically relevant pathogens and related biological material. The same panel as above
in the cross-reactivity study, consisting of forty-seven potentially inhibitory organisms, was
individually spiked into a pool containing low concentrations (approximately 2x LoD) each
of the influenza A, influenza B and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Samples were assayed in three
replicates. No inhibition was observed for influenza A, influenza B, or SARS-CoV-2 by the
organisms at the concentrations shown below.

Interfering Substances
The performance of the Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct assay was evaluated with
potentially interfering substances that may be present in nasopharyngeal passages. A total of 12
potentially interfering substances were individually spiked into a pooled nasopharyngeal swab
matrix containing SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020), Flu A (Hong Kong/8/68) and
Flu B (Malaysia/2506/04) inactivated viral particles, each at a targeted concentration
approximately 3x LoD; each sample was tested in three replicates. There was one potential
occurrence of interference with Cold Eeze oral analgesic at the higher concentration. All other
substances showed no interference at the concentrations listed, including Cold Eeze oral

Specimen Stability
For the specimen stability study, samples were contrived in individual negative samples as
described for the Fresh vs. Frozen study (See below). The samples were tested, then stored at
2-8°C and tested after three days, after five days, after seven days, and after ten days. For this
analysis, the results for the low positive samples (1.5x LoD and 2x LoD) were combined.
Results for positive specimens for each target analyte are summarized in the table below:

Although 90% detection was achieved for Influenza B after 3 days of storage, it was
consistent with the results obtained on fresh samples and, therefore, was likely due to the
concentration being close to the analytical LoD. Subsequent timepoints showed 95% to
100% detection for Influenza B. The package insert indicates that specimens can be stored
for up to 7 days at 2-8 °C.
Fresh versus Frozen
The Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct assay was evaluated for the product’s ability to
detect low levels of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B in nasopharyngeal swabs in
UTM, which were stored below -70°C. Fresh vs frozen stability study showed that samples
can be frozen for three days at or below -70°C for three freeze-thaw cycles.
Samples were stored at ≤ -70°C for at least twenty-four 24 hours before thawing and testing.
Additional freeze/thaw timepoints were tested (i.e., thaws #2 and #3) with each test point
being performed following at least a full 24-hour time frozen at -70°C between.

a Negative result was later retested and confirmed positive. 10/10 detections at the subsequent timepoint
confirmed the frozen stability of that specimen type and concentration.
b Two samples tested negative, possibly due to virus loads being at or below LoD. Subsequent tests showed at
least 95% detection for the three freeze/thaw timepoints.
c Two samples tested negative, possibly due to virus lots being at or below LoD. The experiment was repeated
the next day after the 4th freeze thaw and obtained the expected results.
7. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed using five LIAISON MDX Instruments, two
lots of Reaction Mix and one lot of Positive Control. A total of 77 runs were performed by three
operators over four days. The test samples were prepared by diluting viral stocks of influenza A,
influenza B, and heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 into pooled nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)
specimens collected in UTM. Two strains of each influenza virus and one strain of SARS-CoV-2

were tested. Each of the virus strains was tested at five or more concentrations near the expected
LoD during the initial screening, followed by confirmation testing at one or more concentrations
with two lots of the Reaction Mix, in 40 replicates. The LoD was defined as the concentration of
the virus that resulted in at least 95% detection during confirmation testing for each of the virus
strains. The confirmed LoD values are shown below.

archived nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of
respiratory tract infection.
Prospective specimens were collected from six (6) geographically diverse clinical sites
within the United States between August 2021 and March 2022. There were a total of 1427
specimens enrolled for testing. Amplicon contamination at one testing site resulted in
removal of 226 enrolled specimens. Total excluded samples were 257 which left 1170
prospective specimens suitable for testing. There were 1152/1170 valid results with the
Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct after the first test resulting in an initial invalid rate of
1.5%. The final invalid rate after re-test (according to test protocols) was 0.2% (2/1170
invalid results). Evaluable specimens for comparator testing with Influenza A and Influenza
B were 1168 and 1165, respectively.
Retrospective archived specimens consisted of 82 positive influenza A, 114 positive
influenza B, and 62 negative specimens blinded and randomized for the study. There were no
excluded samples in the retrospective study.
The Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct clinical agreement testing was performed at two
(2) external clinical sites and one (1) internal site. The comparator for influenza A and B
targets was an FDA cleared molecular test. For SARS-CoV-2 comparator testing, a
composite test method (CRM) consisting of three COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorized
RT-PCR assays was performed. Two out of three positive results determined “Detected”
CRM and two out of three negative results determined “Not Detected” CRM. One of the
three EUA-authorized tests became unavailable partway through the prospective clinical
study and therefore only 496 of the prospective specimens were available for SARS-CoV-2
comparison testing.
Performance was evaluated using a multi-assay comparator algorithm (for SARS-CoV-2
performance) and an FDA-cleared comparator assay (for Influenza A and Influenza B).
Tables 19-21 shows the results of the Simplexa COVID-19 & Flu A/B Direct assay and
comparator assay results in the prospective study analysis and Tables 22-24 shows the results
of the retrospective study analysis. The positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative
percent agreement (NPA) were calculated for each target.
