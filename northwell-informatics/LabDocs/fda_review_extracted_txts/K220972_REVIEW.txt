III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Access Thyroglobulin assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of thyroglobulin levels in human serum using the Access
Immunoassay Systems. This device is intended to aid in monitoring for the presence of persistent
or recurrent/metastatic disease in patients who have differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and
have had thyroid surgery (with or without ablative therapy), and who lack serum thyroglobulin
antibodies.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
The Instructions for Use of the device contains the following warning statement:
“The presence of serum autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (TgAb) can interfere with assays for
thyroglobulin (Tg). Therefore, sera which contain TgAb, even at very low levels, should not be
tested for Tg.
The concentration of thyroglobulin in a given specimen determined with assays from different
manufacturers can vary due to differences in assay methods and reagent specificity. The results
reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the Tg assay used. Values
obtained with different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably. If, in the course of
monitoring a patient, the assay method used for determining Tg levels serially is changed,
additional sequential testing should be carried out to confirm baseline values.”

Materials included in the Access Thyroglobulin assay
Reagent Pack (2 packs, 50 tests/pack) contains:
• R1a (3.25 mL): Dynabeads paramagnetic particles coated with streptavidin and coupled
to biotinylated mouse monoclonal antithyroglobulin antibodies in TRIS
buffer with protein (bovine) and preservatives
• R1b (3.10 mL): Mouse monoclonal anti-thyroglobulin-alkaline phosphatase (bovine)
conjugate in a TRIS buffer with protein (bovine, murine) and
preservatives
• R1c (3.10 mL): HEPES buffer with protein (bovine, murine) and preservatives
Materials needed but not supplied
• Access Thyroglobulin Calibrators: Six levels – 0, 1.0, 10, 100, 250, and 500 ng/mL
• Quality control materials: commercial control material
• Access Thyroglobulin Sample Diluent
• Access Substrate
• Access Wash Buffer II / Unicel DxI Wash Buffer II
To mitigate the risk of biotin interference, the Access Thyroglobulin Reagent Pack has been
modified from the previously cleared assay by pre-coupling the biotinylated mouse monoclonal
anti-thyroglobulin antibodies to paramagnetic particles coated with streptavidin.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access Thyroglobulin assay is a simultaneous one-step immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”)
assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel with four biotinylated anti-thyroglobulin antibodies
coated on streptavidin paramagnetic particles, and monoclonal anti-thyroglobulin antibody
alkaline phosphatase conjugate. The thyroglobulin in the sample binds to the biotinylated
antibodies on the solid phase, while the conjugate antibody reacts with a different antigenic site
on the thyroglobulin molecule. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid
phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured
with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of
thyroglobulin in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored,
multi-point calibration curve.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was performed for the modified Access Thyroglobulin assay according to
CLSI EP06-Ed2. Two series were prepared: the first series included seven dilution samples
prepared by mixing a single native serum sample with thyroglobulin concentration at 0.06
ng/mL with a native serum sample pool with thyroglobulin concentration above 500 ng/mL.
The second series included seven dilution samples prepared by mixing a native serum sample
with thyroglobulin concentration at 0.05 ng/mL with the serum sample with thyroglobulin
concentration at 76.77 ng/mL. For both dilution series, the lowest sample was tested in
replicates of eight, while all other samples were tested in replicates of four on one Access 2
Immunoassay System using one reagent lot. The data sets from the two series were combined
for a single linearity analysis. For each level, the mean value of the measured values,
predicted value and the deviation from linearity were calculated. Predicted values were
calculated using a best fitted straight line by a weighted least squares linear regression
analysis. Percent deviations from linearity were calculated as differences between the
observed values (mean values) and the predicted values divided by the predicted values. The
results are summarized in the tables below.
Dilution Range Deviation from
Slope Intercept R2
(ng/mL) Linearity (%)
0.05 - 563.72 1.04 -0.002 0.999 -4.1 – 8.0 %
The data support the linearity interval from 0.05 to 563.72 ng/mL with the deviations from
linearity within ±10%. The study results support the linearity of the claimed analytical
measuring interval (AMI): 0.1 – 500 ng/mL.
Dilution Recovery
Verification studies were performed to determine the sample manual dilution recovery of the
modified Access Thyroglobulin assay on the Access 2 Immunoassay system. For “over
range” manual sample dilution, three serum samples with thyroglobulin concentration at
1202.05, 2003.56, and 2998.53 ng/mL were diluted 1:5 (1 part sample and 4 parts diluent) or
1:10 (1 part sample and 9 parts diluent) in Access Thyroglobulin Sample Diluent according
to the Instructions for Use of the assay. Each dilution preparation was measured for a total of

eight datapoints on each of three reagent pack lots on one Access 2 Immunoassay System.
The percent of recovery was calculated by comparing the observed value to the expected
value for each sample. The results support manual sample dilution suggested for the Access
Thyroglobulin assay.
High Dose Hook Effect:
High dose hook effect of the modified Access Thyroglobulin assay was evaluated by testing
five samples with analyte concentration above the analytical measuring interval: 600, 10450,
20300, 30150 and 41000 ng/mL. Each sample was tested in replicates of five using three lots
of reagents on one Access 2 Immunoassay System. The results showed no high dose hook
effect up to an analyte concentration of 40, 000 ng/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Potential interfering and cross-reacting substances were evaluated for their ability to cross
react or interfere with the performance of the modified Access Thyroglobulin. The studies
were performed following the CLSI EP07-Ed3.
Interference:
Each of potential (endogenous and exogenous) interfering substances was tested at two
thyroglobulin concentrations: 25 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL. Test serum samples were prepared
by spiking the potential interfering substances at one concentration. Results were compared
to matched control samples which were prepared by spiking an equal volume of solvent
(blank) where appropriate. The test samples and control samples were measured in eight
replicates using three reagent lots on the Access 2 Immunoassay System. The recovery was
calculated by comparing measurements of the test and control samples. No interference
(≤±10% difference of test from control) for all three lots of the modified Access
Thyroglobulin reagents up to the concentrations of the potential interfering substances tested
as shown in the table below:

Cross reactivity:
Each potential cross-reacting substance was tested in serum samples at two thyroglobulin
concentrations: 20 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL. Test samples were prepared by spiking with the
potential cross-reacting substances at one concentration. Results were compared to matched
control samples which were spiked with an equal volume of solvent (blank) where
appropriate. The test samples and control samples were measured in eight replicates using
each of three modified reagent lots on the Access 2 Immunoassay System. The recovery was
calculated by comparing measurements of the test and control samples. No cross reactivity
(≤±10% difference of test from control) for all three lots of the modified Access
Thyroglobulin reagents up to the concentrations of the potential cross-reacting substances
tested as shown in the table below:
Cross-Reacting Substance Concentration
3,3',5-Triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) 100 ng/mL
L-Thyroxine (T4) 10 µg/dL
Thyroxine Binding Globulin (TBG) 50 µg/mL
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) 235 mIU/mL)
Blocking Effect of HAMA/Heterophilic Ab:
Eighty heterophilic serum samples were tested in replicates of six to evaluate blocker
effectiveness in the modified Access Thyroglobulin assay using three reagent lots (27
samples tested with Lot 1, 27 samples tested with Lot 2, and 26 samples tested with Lot 3) on
one Access 2 Immunoassay System. Out of 80 samples, HAMA interference was observed in
a total of 19 samples.
The following cautionary note of interference has been included in the “Limitations” section
of the product insert: “Patients who have been regularly exposed to animals or have received
immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures utilizing immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin
fragments may produce antibodies, e.g., HAMA, that interfere with immunoassays.
Additionally, other heterophile antibodies such as human anti-goat antibodies may be present
in patient samples. Such interfering antibodies may cause erroneous results. Carefully
evaluate the results of patients suspected of having these antibodies.”
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay reportable range for the modified Access Thyroglobulin is the same as the claimed
analytical measuring interval (AMI): 0.1–500 ng/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The calibration traceability of the modified Access Thyroglobulin assay has not changed.

Stability:
The stability of the modified Access Thyroglobulin assay is evaluated according to the
recommendation of CLSI EP25-A.
Shelf-life (unopened): Real-time stability and accelerated stability studies were performed to
verify the shelf-life of the modified Access Thyroglobulin assay. For the real-time stability
study, three lots of reagents were subjected to simulated summer shipping and winter
shipping conditions and then stored at the recommended storage condition, 2–10oC as initial
timepoint (T0). Five native patient serum samples within the AMR were tested with a
minimum of two replicates at T0 and at each test time point. The data support a shelf-life of
the modified Access Thyroglobulin assay for 365 days (12 months). The real-time stability
study is on-going.
An accelerated stability study was carried out using one modified Access Thyroglobulin
stored under elevated temperature storage conditions: 32°C for 49 days and 37°C for 20 days.
Five patient serum samples, within the range of the assay, were assayed using three replicates
at each time point of six approximately equally spaced time points. The accelerated stability
study supports a claim for a 25-month shelf-life for the modified Access Thyroglobulin at 2–
10oC.
Open in-use stability: The modified Access Thyroglobulin was evaluated for in-use stability.
Three lots of reagent packs were opened and stored at 10°C. Each lot was tested using
commercial control samples and patient samples, representing low, medium, and high
thyroglobulin concentrations in duplicate at the following time-points 0, 2, 5, 8, 13, 16, 21,
23, 28, 30 days. Fresh reagent packs were tested at each time point as reference. The data
supports the open vial stability of the modified Access Thyroglobulin up to 28 days stored at
2–10°C after initial use.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the
modified Access Thyroglobulin assay were verified based on the CLSI EP17-A2.
The LoB was determined by testing four distinct serum samples containing no measurable
Thyroglobulin using two regent lots. For each Lot, LoB samples were run in five replicates
per run, one run per day, for three days on two Access 2 Immunoassay Systems. LoB was
defined as the value corresponding to the 95th percentile of the rank position of the
distribution of values. The claimed LoB is 0.02 ng/mL which is the highest LoB value
observed across two reagent lots.
The LoD was determined by testing eight native serum specimens using two reagent lots. For
each Lot, LoD samples were run in nine replicates per run, one run per day, for five days on
two Access 2 Immunoassay Systems. The LoD was determined by fitting the precision
profile model between within-lab standard deviation (SD) and concentration. The SD was
multiplied by the 95th percentile of the standard normal distribution and added to the LoB to

calculate the LoD per CLSI EP17-A2. The claimed LoD is 0.05 ng/mL which is the highest
LoD value observed across lots.
The LoQ was determined by testing the same samples used for the LoD study using two
reagent lots on two Access 2 Immunoassay Systems over five days. The LoQ was defined as
the lowest value with within-lab precision ≤ 20% CV. The claimed LoQ is 0.05 ng/mL.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Not applicable
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Refer to K002905
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The reference range for unmodified Access Thyroglobulin assay (predicate) was previously
established based on a study of testing 152 apparently healthy adults (females and males
combined). The results ranged from 1.15 to 130.77 ng/mL, with a median of 9.08 ng/mL, and
2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of 1.59 and 50.03 ng/mL.
To verify this reference range, 28 serum samples from apparently healthy donors were each
tested on three lots of modified Access Thyroglobulin assay (candidate device) and one lot of the
predicate device. The results showed thyroglobulin levels ranging from 4.14 to 130.46 ng/mL
with 97.5th percentiles of 46.44 ng/mL, 44.76 ng/mL, and 46.36 ng/mL for three lots,
respectively. Similar results were also observed for the predicate.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
