K220977 - Page 3 of 18

--- Page 4 ---
The CRP Latex reagent consists of the following:
Reactive Ingredients: Glycine buffer, 100 mmol/L; Latex coated with rabbit anti-CRP
Antibodies, <0.5%
Materials needed but not supplied with the CRP reagent kit : CRP Latex Calibrator Normal (N)
set for the Normal Application; CRP Latex Highly Sensitive (HS) Calibrator for the Highly
Sensitive Application; 0.9% Saline.
B Principle of Operation:
ISE Reagents
The Ion Selective Electrode (ISE) module for Na+, K+, and Cl- measurement employs crown
ether membrane electrodes for sodium and potassium and a molecular oriented PVC membrane
for chloride that are specific for each ion of interest in the sample. An electrical potential is
developed according to the Nernst Equation for a specific ion. When compared to the Internal
Reference Solution, this electrical potential is translated into voltage and then into the ion
concentration of the sample.
Glucose
In this procedure, glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) in the presence of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) and magnesium ions to produce glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and adenosine
diphosphate (ADP). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) specifically oxidizes G-6-P
to 6-phosphogluconate with the concurrent reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced (NADH). The change in absorbance at
340/660 nm is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the sample.
CRP Latex
The CRP Latex reagent is an in vitro diagnostic device that consists of ready to use buffer and
latex particles coated with rabbit anti-CRP antibodies. Immune complexes formed in solution
scatter light in proportion to their size, shape, and concentration. Turbidimeters measure the
reduction of incident light due to reflection, absorption or scatter. In this procedure, the
measurement of the rate of decrease in light intensity transmitted (increase in absorbance)
through particles suspended in solution is the result of complexes formed during the
immunological reaction between the CRP of the patient serum and rabbit anti-CRP-antibodies
covered on latex particles.
The same CRP Latex reagent have two different applications on the instrument: Normal
Application (CRP concentrations ranging between 5.0-480 mg/L) and Highly Sensitive (Cardiac)
Application (CRP concentrations ranging between 0.2- 80 mg/L).These two applications require
separate calibrators and instrument workflows.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability and within-laboratory precision studies were designed in accordance with the
CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. Per assay type, each sample was assayed in duplicate per run, two
(2) runs per day for twenty (20) days in random order (N=80 for each sample) using one (1)
lot of reagent, one (1) lot of calibrator on one (1) instrument.
The precision performance for ISE reagents (Na+, K+ and Cl – ) was evaluated by testing
spiked serum pools and urine pools. The precision performance for the glucose assay was
evaluated by testing spiked serum pools, urine pools and CSF pools. The precision
performance for the CRP latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application) and CRP latex (normal
application) was evaluated by testing spiked serum pools. The within-laboratory precision
includes the within-run, between-run and between-day components. The precision study
results are summarized in the tables below:

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP07, 3rd Edition
guideline. Common endogenous substances were evaluated for each candidate assay to
determine the potential interference effects to the assay performance.
For each assay type, samples at high and low concentrations were prepared (see table below)
and each sample was further divided into two aliquots: test samples (with added interference
substances) and control samples (without interference substances). Each sample was assayed
in five (5) replicates. The results of the spiked samples were compared to the results of non-
spiked samples for each assay. At the following concentrations, the percentage difference
was less than ± 10% between the test samples results and control samples results.

CRP Latex exogenous interference study
Sixteen (16) commonly used drugs were assessed for potential exogenous interference for the
CRP latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application) and the CRP latex (normal application).
The exogenous substances were tested at approximately three (3) times the peak therapeutic
concentrations as recommended by the CLSI EP37 guideline. Samples with three (3) analyte
levels were divided into paired control samples (without interference substances) and test
samples (with interference substances). Each test sample and control sample was assayed in 5
replicates with two (2) lot of reagents and calibrators on one DxC 500AU Analyzer. The
results of the test samples were compared to the results of the control samples. At the
following concentrations, the percent difference between the results of the spiked samples
compared to the results of the control samples was less than ± 4%.

The following is a new limitation for the Glucose reagent:
“Eltrombopag and its metabolites may interfere with this assay causing erroneously high
patient results.”
The other limitations remain the same as described in K161837.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Assays reportable ranges are described in the linearity section (VII.A.2 above).
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The traceability of the ISE Reagents and Glucose is unchanged (cleared in K921718 and
K043460, respectively).
CRP Latex: Assay is traceable to ERM DA472/IFCC.
6. Detection Limit:
Detection limit studies were designed in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. The
limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) for the Glucose
assay, the CRP Latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application) and the CRP Latex (normal
application) were determined by running replicate measurements on blank and low-level
samples across multiple days using two (2) reagent lots on one DxC 500 AU Analyzer, with
each lot evaluated separately for each parameter. Per assay and specimen type, a total of 72
blank replicates were generated per reagent lot (4 blank samples ran in replicates of 6 for 3
days) to determine the LoB. For LoD and LoQ determinations, 250 low-level sample
replicates were generated per Glucose assay specimen type per reagent lot (10 low-level
samples ran in replicates of 5 for 5 days), 325 low-level sample replicates were generated for
the CRP Latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application) per reagent lot (13 low-level samples
ran in replicates of 5 for 5 days), and 500 low-level sample replicates were generated for the
CRP Latex (normal application) per reagent lot (10 low-level samples ran in replicates of 10
for 5 days). The LoB was determined following the classic approach and the LoD and LoQ
were determined following the precision profile approach described in the guideline. The
sponsor defines the LoQ as the lowest concentration with a within-laboratory precision of ≤

9. Carry-Over:
Carry-over study was performed for the CRP Latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application)
with the DxC 500AU contamination parameters that provide additional cleaning of the
sample probe before and after each CRP sample is tested. The study supports the carry-over
information provided in the CRP assay Instruction-for-Use.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP09c guideline
comparing the results from the candidate devices to the predicate devices. A minimum of 100
samples with analyte concentrations within the claimed analytical ranges were evaluated for
the ISE Reagents, Glucose, CRP Latex (highly sensitive (cardiac) application) and CRP
Latex (normal application) for each sample type respectively. Each sample was assayed in
duplicate by the candidate method and the comparator method on the same day. Weighted
Deming regression analysis was performed using the first replicate result only, and results are
summarized in the table below.

2. Matrix Comparison:
ISE reagents (Na+, K+, Cl-):
A matrix comparison study was performed to demonstrate the equivalence between serum
and plasma samples when measuring sodium, potassium and chloride on the DxC 500
Analyzer. Each study utilized freshly drawn paired serum and plasma samples from over
forty (40) donors. Less than 20% of the total samples were altered by diluting or spiking in
order to cover the claimed measuring range. For each pair of samples, only one measurement
was obtained for the evaluation tube and one measurement for the serum control tube.
Weighted Deming regression analysis was performed, and the results are summarized below:

The results of the matrix comparison studies support the sponsor’s claim that serum, lithium
heparin, and ammonium heparin plasma samples are suitable for use on the candidate ISE
Reagents.
Glucose :
A matrix comparison study was performed on the DxC AU 500 Analyzer to evaluate the
performance of K EDTA, K EDTA, Fluoride Oxalate, and Lithium Heparin plasma samples
2 3
compared to serum samples for the Glucose test. Fifty-nine (59) paired samples were
evaluated for each combination and less than 16% of the total samples were altered to cover
