III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Hipro® Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) Test System comprised of the Hipro
Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test kit and the HP-AFS/1 automatic immunoassay analyzer
is used as an aid in diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, as an aid to identify patients who may be at
risk for developing diabetes mellitus, and for the monitoring of long-term blood glucose control
in individuals with diabetes mellitus. It is an in vitro diagnostics reagent system intended for
quantitative determination of % hemoglobin A1c (DCCT/NGSP) in venous whole blood.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
- The device should not be used to diagnose Diabetes Mellitus in patients with iron deficiency
and hemolytic anemia, various hemoglobinopathies, thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis,
malignancies and severe chronic hepatic and renal disease.
- The device should not be used in pregnant patients, patients with heterozygous sickle cell
trait, hemolytic diseases and recent significant or chronic blood loss.
- The device should not be used in the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.
- In cases of rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes the increase of HbA1c values might be delayed
compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions diabetes
mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentration and/or the typical
clinical symptoms.
- This device has significant interference with fetal hemoglobin (HbF). HbA1c results are
invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF including those with known Hereditary
Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The HP-AFS/1 automatic immunoassay analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Hipro® glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test system consists of the Hipro Glycosylated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) test kit and the HP-AFS/1 automatic immunoassay analyzer. The Hipro
Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test kit further consists of two reagents R1 and R2. The
Reagent 1 (R1) contains latex in a glycine buffer, and the Reagent 2 (R2) contains Goat anti-
mouse IgG and mouse anti-human HbA1c monoclonal antibody.
K220999 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The antigen-antibody reaction is used to directly determine the percentage of glycosylated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) in total hemoglobin (Hb). The total hemoglobin and glycosylated
hemoglobin in the sample have the same non-specific adsorption with latex to form a solid
phase. When the specific HbA1c monoclonal antibody is added, a latex-HbA1c-mouse anti-
human HbA1c monoclonal antibody complex is formed to cause agglutination due to the goat
anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody. The amount of agglutination is proportional to
the amount of HbA1c solidified on the latex surface. The percentage of HbA1c in the sample to
the total Hb can be obtained from the measured rate of change of the scattered light intensity at
specific wavelength compared with the standard curve of the percentage concentration of
HbA1c.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
The HP-AFS/1 automatic immunoassay analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Sample identification number can either be entered manually or scanned on barcode.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Human venous whole blood should be collected in K2 EDTA tubes and can be stored at 2℃-
8℃ for 10 days before use.
4. Calibration:
Calibration information is provided for each new lot of the test kit through the QR code on
the label of R1.
5. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends multi-level controls being tested in each HbA1c run using
Liquidchek Diabetes Control (K123798) from Bio-Rad as the quality control material of the
device. Each laboratory should establish its own control ranges and routinely use quality
control materials in every HbA1c run.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A. Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted with the Hipro Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) Test
System using four K2 EDTA venous whole blood samples containing approximately 5.2%,
6.4%, 8.0%, and 12.3% HbA1c concentrations (P1, P2, P3 and P4 respectively) and two
control samples containing approximately 6% and 11% HbA1c concentrations (QC1 and
QC2 respectively). Samples were analyzed on three HP-AFS/1 Automatic Immunoassay
Analyzer instruments using three lots of reagents on each instrument. Each sample was
analyzed in two runs per day, two replicates per run, for 20 days. The results are shown

2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated for the Hipro Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) Test System using
a dilution series consisting of 9 levels of HbA1c prepared by mixing high and low HbA1c
whole blood pools in K2 EDTA. The expected sample concentrations were 4.3%, 5.5%,
6.4%, 7.4%, 8.4%, 10.2%, 11.4%, 12.6% and 13.8% HbA1c. Three replicates were tested at
each concentration. The measured values were compared to the expected values. The linear
regression is the following:
Y=1.0225X ─ 0.1524, R2=0.999
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous and Exogenous Substances:
Interference studies were performed to assess the impact of endogenous and exogenous
substances on the performance of the Hipro Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) Test System.
Pooled whole blood at two HbA1c levels (~6.6 and ~8.7% HbA1c) in K2 EDTA spiked with
potential interferent was analyzed and compared to the same whole blood pool without
interferent (control). The highest concentrations at which no significant interference (a
difference of no more than ±7% from the control sample as defined by the sponsor) was
observed are summarized below:

Hemoglobin Variant Interference:
A hemoglobin variant study was performed using K2 EDTA venous whole blood samples
known to contain hemoglobin variants HbS, HbC, HbE, HbD, HbA2, and HbF. The samples
containing the hemoglobin variants were tested using the Hipro Glycosylated Hemoglobin
(HbA1c) Test System and using the comparator method (Bio-Rad VARIANT II TURBO
Hemoglobin Testing System), which has been demonstrated to be free from interference by
these hemoglobin variants. The following table summarizes the tested samples:
Hemoglobin Number of Variant Range of %HbA1c
Variant Samples Concentration Range (%) Concentration
HbS 20 16.8%-76.9% 5.1-9.4
HbC 20 25%-66.6% 4.7-9.7

variability
The results show that there is no significant interference for HbS, HbC, HbE, HbD, and
HbA2 at the concentrations stated in the table above.
The sponsor has included the following prominent boxed warning in the labeling: This
device has significant negative interference with fetal hemoglobin (HbF). HbA1c results
are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF including those with known
Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range for this device is 4.3-14.0% HbA1c.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The assigned HbA1c values of the Hipro glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test kit are
certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP
certification expires in one year. See the NGSP website for current certification at
http://www.ngsp.org.
6. Detection Limit:
The claimed measuring range for the HbA1c values of the Hipro glycosylated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) test kit is 4.3 to 14%.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable. See method comparison study below.
9. Carry-Over:
Not applicable.
B. Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison testing was performed using 120 human whole blood samples in K2
EDTA with values spanning the assay measurement range of HbA1c. The candidate
device results were compared to those from testing performed at a secondary NGSP
reference laboratory on the Bio-Rad D-100 HbA1c Test as the comparator method. The
distribution of samples spanning the measuring interval is as follows:
% HbA1c N % of sample
tested
≤ 5% 9 7.5
5.0 – 6.0% 11 9.2
6.0 – 6.5% 25 20.8
6.5 – 7.0% 36 30
7.0 – 8.0% 10 8.3
8.0 – 9.0% 10 8.3
> 9.0% 19 15.8
Total 120 100
Regression analyses were performed for the candidate device versus the comparator
method. Summary of regression results are as follows:

Total Error:
The bias estimation values determined in the method comparison study and the precision
determined in the precision study were used to determine the total error at each of the
HbA1c levels listed in the tables below. Total error was calculated by the following
equation:
%TE = |%Bias| + (1.96 x %CV) x (1 + %Bias/100)
