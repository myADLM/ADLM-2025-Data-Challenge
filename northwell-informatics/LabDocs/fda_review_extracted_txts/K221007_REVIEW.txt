A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
cobas® HCV is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for both the detection and quantitation
of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, in human EDTA plasma or serum, of HCV antibody positive or
HCV-infected individuals. Specimens containing HCV genotypes 1 to 6 are validated for
detection and quantitation in the assay.
cobas® HCV is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of HCV infection in the following
populations: individuals with antibody evidence of HCV with evidence of liver disease,
individuals suspected to be actively infected with HCV antibody evidence, and individuals at risk
for HCV infection with antibodies to HCV. Detection of HCV RNA indicates that the virus is
replicating and therefore is evidence of active infection.
cobas® HCV is intended for use as an aid in the management of HCV-infected patients
undergoing anti-viral therapy. The assay can be used to measure HCV RNA levels at baseline,
during treatment, at the end of treatment, and at the end of follow up of treatment to determine
sustained or non-sustained viral response. The results must be interpreted within the context of
all relevant clinical and laboratory findings.
cobas® HCV has not been approved for use as a screening test for the presence of HCV in blood
or blood products.
Assay performance characteristics have been established for individuals treated with certain
direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) regimens. No information is available on the assay’s
predictive value when other DAA combination therapies are used.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The cobas HCV assay is a quantitative test performed on the cobas 5800 System, cobas 6800
System or cobas 8800 System. The test detects and quantitates HCV RNA in EDTA plasma or
serum of infected patients. Dual probes are used to detect and quantify, but not discriminate
genotypes 1–6. The viral load is quantified against a non-HCV armored RNA quantitation
standard (RNA-QS), which is introduced into each specimen during sample preparation. The
RNA-QS also functions as an internal control to assess substantial failures during the sample
preparation and PCR amplification processes.
K221007 - Page 2 of 3

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
Nucleic acid from patient samples, external controls and added armored RNA-QS molecules are
simultaneously extracted by addition of proteinase and lysis reagent to the sample. The released
nucleic acid binds to the silica surface of the added magnetic glass particles. Unbound substances
and impurities, such as denatured protein, cellular debris and potential PCR inhibitors are
removed with subsequent wash buffer steps and purified nucleic acid is eluted from the magnetic
glass particles with elution buffer at elevated temperature.
Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the sample is achieved by the use of target
virus-specific forward and reverse primers which are selected from highly conserved regions of
HCV. Selective amplification of RNA-QS is achieved by the use of sequence-specific forward
and reverse primers which are selected to have no homology with the HCV genome. A
thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme is used for both reverse-transcription and PCR
amplification. The target and RNA-QS sequences are amplified simultaneously utilizing a
universal PCR amplification profile with predefined temperature steps and number of cycles.
The master mix includes deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP), instead of deoxythimidine
triphosphate (dTTP), which is incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA (amplicon).1-3 Any
contaminating amplicon from previous PCR runs are eliminated by the AmpErase enzyme,
which is included in the PCR mix, during the first thermal cycling step. However, newly formed
amplicon are not eliminated since the AmpErase enzyme is inactivated once exposed to
temperatures above 55°C.
The cobas HCV master mix contains dual detection probes specific for the HCV target sequences
and one for the RNA-QS. The probes are labeled with target-specific fluorescent reporter dyes
allowing simultaneous detection of HCV target and RNA-QS in two different target channels.
When not bound to the target sequence, the fluorescent signal of the intact probe is suppressed
by a quencher dye. During the PCR amplification step, hybridization of the probes to the specific
single-stranded DNA template results in cleavage of the probe by the 5'-to-3' nuclease activity of
the DNA polymerase resulting in separation of the reporter and quencher dyes and the generation
of a fluorescent signal. With each PCR cycle, increasing amounts of cleaved probes are
generated and the cumulative signal of the reporter dye increases concomitantly. Real-time
detection and discrimination of PCR products is accomplished by measuring the fluorescence of
the released reporter dyes for the viral targets and RNA-QS.

2. Linearity:
Assay linearity was assessed using the predominant genotype (GT1) in plasma. The linearity
panels were prepared as serial dilutions designed to cover the entire linear range of the assay.
The dilution series consisted of 16 concentration levels spanning the intended linear range.
The dilution series were prepared by diluting an arHCV-MS08-pCP1 specimen and an HCV
positive clinical specimen in negative pooled EDTA-plasma. The Titer assignment of the
study panels has been performed via Calibrator Bracketing Method (CBM). The panels were
tested with three different lots of the cobas HCV kits. The dilution series covered a total of
36 replicates per concentration level in negative pooled EDTA plasma which were tested
with 3 kit lots and tested on 2 cobas 5800 Systems over the course of 6 days.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The results of the linearity study and calculation of the Lower and Upper Limits of
Quantitation confirm the assay reportable range is consistent across analyzer platforms: 15
IU/mL – 1.00E+08 IU/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
See P150015
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was assessed with a sample panel prepared with an HCV
secondary standard and HCV negative pooled EDTA plasma. The dilution series was
prepared with 6 concentration levels - 3 levels below the expected LoD, 1 level near the
expected LoD and 2 levels above the expected LoD by diluting the secondary standard in
pooled negative EDTA plasma. The panel was tested with 3 kit lots, on 7 days, on 3 cobas
5800 systems and 1 cobas 6800/8800 system over multiple runs, with multiple operators and
with multiple replicates per run.

Sample carryover on the cobas 5800 was evaluated with the cobas HBV assay. Alternating
negative and HBV high positive samples were processed and detected with several
checkerboard configurations on the cobas 5800 Systems. A high titer HBV plasmid sample
used in this study was prepared by diluting in pooled negative EDTA plasma to yield a mean
titer of 9.11 x108 IU/mL.
Eighty-three runs were performed yielding 1926 valid sample results.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted using 150 archived, well-characterized HCV
positive plasma specimens and 30 HCV negative individual plasma specimens. Some of the
individual positive specimens were diluted to achieve the desired number of samples at
specified concentrations: ~50 HCV specimens between 1.5 E+01 to 3E+03 IU/mL, ~50
specimens between 3E+03 to 5E+05 IU/mL and ~50 specimens between 5E+05 to 1E+08
IU/mL. Each specimen was tested on the cobas 5800 System at three different sites (1
internal and 2 external) and on a cobas 6800/8800 System at one site (internal) using three
reagent lots.
Results:
For the 30 samples with target not detected (TND) results by cobas 6800/8800, one sample
(1/30) by cobas 5800 test at one site was positive (with concentration <1.5E+01, out of the
linear range). At the other two sites the NPA=100% (30/30).
All of the positive samples were within the linear range of 1.5E+1 IU/mL to 1E+8 IU/mL by
cobas 6800/8800 (150/150 =100%) and by cobas 5800 (450/450=100%). Among the three

decision points by site. The biases are very close to zero in all cases, ranging from -0.035 to
0.040 and are all below the SDs observed in the reproducibility study for cobas 6800/8800
(range from 0.098 to 0.244).

A Bland-Altman (BA) plot between the results of the two systems (cobas 5800 and cobas
6800/8800 instrument) with allowable total difference (ATD) zone were created for each site
and for all sites combined.
Table 9 shows the percentage of samples falling within the ATD zone at low, medium and
high viral load ranges and over the entire range along with the one-sided 95% CIs for all
sites combined. Over the entire range, 100% of the samples fell within the ATD zone and the
lower bound of the one-sided 95% CI was 100%.
