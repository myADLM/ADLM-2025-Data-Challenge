IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The device consists of two reagents: R1 buffer (Tris buffer pH 7.2, polyethylene glycol 6000)
and R2 (goat anti-IgG antiserum). The reagents contain sodium azide as preservative.
Reagent (for Serum/Plasma Application)
• Tris buffer pH 7.2 48 mmol/L
• Polyethylene glycol 6000 3.1%
• Goat anti-IgG antiserum Dependent on titer
Reagent (for Cerebrospinal Fluid Application)
• Tris buffer pH 7.2 63 mmol/L
• Polyethylene glycol 6000 4.9%
Goat anti-IgG antiserum Dependent on titer
Serum Protein Multi-Calibrator is needed but not supplied with reagent kit.
B Principle of Operation:
The IgG assay is a reagent for the quantitative determination of IgG immunoglobulins in human
serum, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on Beckman Coulter AU/DxC AU analyzers.
The device consists of two reagents: R1 buffer (Tris buffer pH 7.2, polyethylene glycol 6000)
and R2 (goat anti-IgG antiserum). When a sample is mixed with R1 buffer and R2 antiserum
solution, human IgG reacts specifically with anti-human IgG antibodies to yield insoluble
aggregates. Immune complexes formed in solution scatter light in proportion to their size, shape,
K221114 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
and concentration. Turbidimeters then measure the reduction of incident light due to reflection,
absorption, or scatter of the colloidal suspension. The decrease in intensity of light transmitted
(i.e., increase in absorbance) through particles suspended in solution is a result of complexes
formed by antigen-antibody reactions.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the serum IgG assay was evaluated per CLSI EP-06 2nd Edition guideline. A
high concentration native IgG sample pool was mixed with gamma-globulin depleted native
serum sample pool to create a 11-dilution level test series covering the analytical measuring
interval (75–3000 mg/dL). Sample dilutions were assayed in quadruplicate using one lot of
IgG reagent on one DxC 500 AU analyzer. Linearity of the CSF IgG assay was also
evaluated using the same study design. The linearity of the IgG with serum and CSF
application tested on the DxC 500 AU is summarized in the table below:
Sample Dilution
Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) R² % Bias
Type Range (mg/dL)
Serum 73.3–3261.9 1.00 (0.97–1.03) 0.00 (-7.43–7.43) 0.998 -5.0% – 7.3%
CSF 1.9–53.0 1.00 (0.99–1.01) 0.03 (-0.12–0.17) 1.000 -8.8% – 1.7%
The results support the linearity of the claimed measuring range of the IgG assay: 75–3000
mg/dL for serum sample, and 2–50 mg/dL for CSF sample.
Prozone/Hook Effect:
The potential for a prozone effect of the IgG assay on the DxC 500 AU was evaluated using
three reagent lots and one calibrator lot. Testing 15 inter-dilutions of one high serum pool did
not indicate a prozone effect with serum IgG concentrations up to 36,785 mg/dL. Testing 18
inter-dilutions of the high CSF pool did not indicate a prozone effect with CSF IgG
concentrations up to 7,419 mg/dL.
Automatic Dilution:
The automatic dilution study was performed to evaluate the accuracy of the analyzer’s auto-
dilution function to obtain IgG results for samples with analyte concentrations above the

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
For the IgG assay, the effect of the presence of endogenous interferents in samples was
evaluated by testing two serum samples (IgG concentration at 1000 and 2000 mg/dL) and
two CSF samples (IgG concentration at 5 and 20 mg/dL) with a range of concentrations of
the interferent substances listed below. Each sample was tested at four concentrations of each
interferent in duplicate using one reagent lot and one calibrator lot on one DxC 500 AU
analyzer. Samples without interferent were used as control for each interferent substance. No
interference was observed up to the following concentration of each tested substance:

On-board stability: Study was performed to support the stability of reagent and calibration
when stored on-board the instrument, DxC 500 AU analyzer. Four serum samples (with
concentration level at 502.8, 1779.2, 978.4, and 2197.3 mg/dL) and five CSF samples (with
concentration level at: 4.15, 6.61, 10.98, 978.4, and 2197.3 mg/dL) were used. The testing
was performed using one lot and one calibrator lot on one DxC 500 AU analyzer at testing
time points of 0, 34, 66, and 98 days for serum IgG and 0, 97, 98, and 100 days for CSF IgG.
The results support the following on-board stability for the IgG reagent stored in the
refrigerated compartment of the analyzer and calibration stability when the assay run on the
DxC 500 AU analyzer:

CSF 90 days 2 days
6. Detection Limit:
The detection limit of the IgG assay on the DxC 500 AU analyzer was performed according
to CLSI EP17-A2.
The limit of blank (LoB) for the IgG assay was determined by testing four analyte-depleted
blank serum samples tested in six replicates per day for three days on the DxC 500 AU using
two reagent lots generating a total of 72 datapoints per reagent lot. All measurements yielded
values below 5.6 mg/dL for serum and below 0.11 mg/dL for CSF.
The limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) for the IgG assay was
determined by testing 10 low-level native samples 10 replicates per day for five days on the
DxC 500 AU using two reagent lots generating a total of 500 datapoints per reagent lot for
each serum and CSF application. LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of analyte that
can be consistently detected and LoQ is the lowest amount of a measurand that can be
quantitatively determined with stated precision. The LoD and LoQ for serum sample are: 8.6
mg/dL and 18.5 mg/dL (with precision of 10% CV), respectively. The LoD and LoQ for CSF
sample are 0.31 and 0.63 (with precision of 20% CV), respectively.
The results support the claimed the LoQ for the IgG assay as 75 mg/dL for serum application
and 2 mg/dL for CSF application when tested on the DxC 500 AU.
