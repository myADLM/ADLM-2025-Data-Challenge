B Principle of Operation:
The candidate device is a single step immunometric test for the quantitative measurement of
intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) in human serum and plasma. The test sample (80 µL) is first
added to the Biotin-BSA, Streptavidin, and a biotin/anti-PTH antibody conjugate (mouse
monoclonal) coated well, followed by assay reagent (sample diluent). Next, horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-labelled anti-PTH antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal) is added to the
well, followed by incubation. Unbound (HRP)-labelled anti-PTH antibody conjugate is then
removed by washing. The bound HRP conjugate is measured by luminescent reaction. The HRP
in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative substrate, producing
light. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of iPTH
present in the sample. The reaction is complete in approximately 18 minutes.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3. Pooled serum patient
samples (spiked at higher concentrations) were tested using three reagent lots on two Vitros
3600 Immunodiagnostic Systems. Samples were assayed in duplicate using 2 runs per day
over 20 days for a total of 80 replicates per sample per lot. Within lab precision was
determined using a single reagent lot. Within-run (repeatability) and within-lab (total)
precision results for a representative reagent lot on a single instrument are summarized
below:

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP06 2nd Edition. A high and a
low human serum pool were prepared by spiking stripped, filtered human serum. Thirteen
(13) dilutions were created by mixing the high human serum pool with the low human serum
pool. The samples spanned from 2.9 pg/mL to 5,200 pg/mL PTH. Five (5) replicates were

measured for each panel member using a single reagent lot on one VITROS 3600
Immunodiagnostic System. The data were analyzed using a weighted linear regression
model. The deviation from linearity did not exceed 5.9%.
The results support the claimed measuring interval of 6.8 – 5000 pg/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interfering Substances:
An endogenous and exogenous interference study was performed in accordance with CLSI
EP-07 3rd edition. Endogenous serum samples with low (~30 pg/mL) or high (~100 pg/mL)
iPTH concentrations were spiked with potentially interfering substances. Percent interference
was calculated using the following equation:
100 × (mean result of the test substance) – (mean result of the control sample)
mean result of the control sample
Interference was defined by the sponsor as ≥ 10% difference from the control sample.

Interference was observed for three (3) substances (cefoxitin sodium, rheumatoid factor and
total protein) with the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Product Intact PTH II Reagent Pack. As
shown below, bias ≥ 10% was reported for each substance, except rheumatoid factor at 100
pg/mL iPTH.

Cefoxitin Sodium* 174.25 mg/dL -11.4
Rheumatoid Factor 30 675 IU/mL 13.5

Cefoxitin Sodium 174.25 mg/dL -12.2
Rheumatoid Factor 100 900 IU/mL 6.3
Total protein 11.9 g/dL -14.0
* The level of interference for Cefoxitin Sodium is within the therapeutic range for this
compound and could lead to lower reported PTH concentrations for patients on this
compound.
The following limitations are included in the labeling:
Heterophile as well as human anti-animal antibodies (most common human anti-mouse
antibodies or HAMA) in serum or plasma of certain individuals are known to cause
interference with immunoassays. The anti-animal antibodies may be present in blood
samples from individuals regularly exposed to animals or who have received
preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy. Results
inconsistent with clinical observations indicate the need for additional testing.
Patients taking Cefoxitin Sodium could have reported PTH concentrations that are
negatively biased at levels indicated in the Known Interferences section.
Rheumatoid factor concentrations less than 450 IU/mL have demonstrated no observed
interference. Rheumatoid factor at concentrations of 675 IU/mL and above have been
shown to falsely elevate PTH test results.
Total protein at concentrations less than 9.4 g/dL have demonstrated no observed
interference. Total protein at concentrations of 11.8 g/dL and above have been shown to
falsely decrease PTH test results.
Cross-Reactivity:
Cross-reactivity studies were performed according to CLSI EP-07 3rd edition. Cross-
reactivity was determined by spiking each cross-reactant into serum containing either no
PTH (stripped serum) or 30 pg/mL endogenous PTH. Each test and control sample was
measured in five (5) replicates using three reagent lots on one (1) instrument. Percent cross-
reactivity was calculated using the following equation:

*Not Detectable (ND). Concentration was below the measuring interval of the test (6.8 – 5000 pg/mL).
The following limitation is included in the labeling:
The VITROS Intact PTH II assay will detect non-intact PTH molecules, such as the large
C-terminal PTH fragment 7-84. PTH fragments, including 7-84, may cause falsely
elevated PTH results in patients with abnormal renal function as these patients may have
various concentrations of PTH fragments in their blood. In patients with atypical renal
function, interpret the PTH result with caution, and do not make patient management
decisions on the PTH result alone. A study describing PTH fragmentation is provided in
Lopez et al “Selected Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometric Immunoassay Responsive
to Parathyroid Hormone and Related Variants.”
High dose hook effect:
No high dose hook effect was observed for samples containing up to 837,800 pg/mL (88,807
pmol/L) iPTH.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See Linearity section above.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Intact PTH II Reagent Pack is traceable to internal
standards prepared with synthetic human iPTH.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
evaluated based on the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.

LoB was determined using five (5) samples containing no measurable PTH. Each of the 5
samples were measured 20 times over 5 days using 1 instrument and 3 reagent lots for a total
of 100 replicates per reagent lot. The LoB was calculated non-parametrically by using the
95th percentile of 100 ranked observations for each lot.
LoD was determined using a non-parametric approach and included 5 low measurand serum
sample pools. Each sample was measured in 50 replicates over 5 days using 1 instrument and
3 reagent lots for a total of 250 replicates per reagent lot. The LoD value was determined as
the highest resultant value of the three lots.
LoQ was determined using the precision profile approach and included 5 low measurand
serum sample pools with analyte concentrations ranging from 1.2 to 2.4 pg/mL. Each sample
was measured in 50 replicates over 5 days using 1 instrument and 3 reagent lots for a total of
250 replicates per reagent lot. LoQ is defined as the lowest analyte concentration that can be
measured with an intermediate precision CV of ≤ 20 %.
