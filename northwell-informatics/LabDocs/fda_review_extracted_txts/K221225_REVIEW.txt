III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access TSH (3rd IS) assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for
the quantitative determination of human thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropin, TSH, hTSH)
levels in human serum and plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems. Measurements of
thyroid stimulating hormone produced by the anterior pituitary are used in the diagnosis of
thyroid or pituitary disorders. This assay is capable of providing 3rd generation TSH results.
The DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is an in vitro diagnostic device used for the
quantitative, semi-quantitative, or qualitative determination of various analyte concentrations
found in human body fluids.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is an in vitro diagnostic device used for the
quantitative, semi-quantitative, or qualitative determination of various analyte concentrations
found in human body fluids. The analyzer subsystems include the luminometer, and components
for handling fluids, compressed air, samples, and consumables. The DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer provides automated, continuous, random-access processing.
The Access TSH (3rd IS) reagent pack is ready to use and consists of the following reagents:
• R1a: Paramagnetic particles coated with mouse monoclonal anti- human TSH
antibody suspended in TRIS buffered saline, with surfactant, bovine serum albumin
(BSA), <0.1% sodium azide, and 0.1% ProClin 300.
• R1b: TRIS buffered saline with surfactant, BSA, protein (murine), < 0.1% sodium
azide, and 0.1% ProClin 300.
• R1c: Mouse monoclonal anti-human TSH alkaline phosphatase conjugate in ACES
buffered saline, with surfactant, BSA matrix, protein (murine), < 0.1% sodium azide,
and 0.25% ProClin 300.
• R1d: Mouse monoclonal anti-human TSH alkaline phosphatase conjugate in ACES
buffered saline, with surfactant, BSA matrix, protein (murine), < 0.1% sodium azide,

--- Page 3 ---
and 0.25% ProClin 300.
Reagent packs are made in two configurations to contain enough materials for 100 or 200 tests.
Materials needed but not supplied with reagent kit include Access TSH (3rd IS) Calibrators,
Quality Control (QC) materials, Access Wash Buffer II and Access Substrate (Lumi-Phos PRO).
B Principle of Operation:
The Access TSH (3rd IS) assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A sample is
added to a reaction vessel with mouse anti-hTSH-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, buffered
protein solution and paramagnetic particles coated with immobilized mouse monoclonal anti-
hTSH antibody. The hTSH binds to the immobilized monoclonal anti-hTSH antibody on the
solid phase while the mouse anti-hTSH-alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts with a different
antigenic site on the hTSH. After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a
magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate
is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The
light production is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte
concentration is automatically determined from a stored multi-point calibration curve.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification can be done by a barcode or by manual entry. Barcode labels are
read by the analyzer. Orders that are entered manually include the rack ID and position, so
bar code labels are not necessary for sample identification.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling and handling procedures are analyte-specific and are documented in the
specific reagent Instructions for Use (IFU).
4. Calibration:
Calibrators are packaged in sets and are dedicated to particular assays. The number of
calibrators required is defined by the assay protocol file. Specific information is provided on
a calibration card included with each calibrator set. This data can be entered into the system
configuration using a virtual keyboard or the external barcode gun. Assay calibration can be
performed when prompted by the DxI 9000 analyzer or when requested by the operator.
Assay calibration data are automatically evaluated by the system, using acceptance criteria
defined by the assay protocol file (APF). The calibration acceptance criteria are
automatically applied to the data and acceptance or rejection of data occurs without operator
intervention. A current (or active) assay calibration is required for each assay that is to be
performed.

--- Page 4 ---
The DxI 9000 analyzer provides three types of assay calibrations.
• Quantitative calibrator results provide a multipoint calibration curve that is used to
calculate the concentration of an analyte in a patient sample or control. A calibration
curve is used to convert raw measurements in RLUs to specific analyte
concentrations. Results are then expressed as numerical units.
• Semiquantitative calibrator results provide a multipoint calibration curve to which
patient samples are compared in order to calculate a concentration value and
categorize them into qualitative classes for the analyte such as reactive, non-reactive,
or equivocal.
• Qualitative calibrator results provide a cutoff determined by a predefined formula
defined in the APF. The analyzer compares a result to the cutoff and then expresses
the result as reactive or non-reactive for the analyte.
5. Quality Control:
The labeling recommends that at least two levels of an appropriate quality control material be
tested a minimum of once a day. The labeling also recommends that quality control testing
should be performed in accordance with laboratory accreditation requirements, applicable
laws and good laboratory practices.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted to estimate repeatability and within-laboratory precision.
The study was run on three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzers and three reagent pack lots.
Five serum samples with approximate TSH concentrations of 0.02, 0.4, 5.0, 12.0 and 50.0
μIU/mL were used in the determination of imprecision. Each sample was assayed in
duplicate, in two runs per day, over twenty days for a total of 40 runs and 80 replicates per
instrument. Each instrument was evaluated with one reagent lot. The within-run, between-
run, between-day, and total imprecision was calculated. Results from multiple lots were
similar. Results from one representative lot are provided in the table below:

A reproducibility study was conducted to assess instrument-to-instrument variability. Five
serum samples with different TSH concentrations were run on three DxI 9000 Immunoassay
Analyzers. The samples were tested across three reagent lots and one calibrator lot on each
instrument with five replicates per run and one run per day over five days. The within-run,
between-day, between-instrument, and reproducibility was calculated for each reagent lot.

2. Linearity:
Two studies were performed to determine the linearity of the Access TSH (3rd IS) assay on
the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer.
In Study One, serum samples covering the full analytical measuring range of the assay were
used for the linearity determination. A native serum sample containing a low concentration of
TSH and a high sample (prepared by spiking TSH antigen into a low serum sample) were
mixed to make nine sample concentrations (0.002 - 58.545 μIU/mL) evenly distributed
across the analytical measuring range. The low sample was run in replicates of eight, and all
other samples were run in replicates of four. This study was run on one DxI 9000
Immunoassay Analyzer, using three reagent lots and one calibrator lot. The deviation from
linearity did not exceed 0.0000003 μIU/mL for values ≤ 0.02 μIU/mL or 5% for values >
0.02 μIU/mL. The results support the Access TSH (3rd IS) assay’s claimed measuring range
of 0.01 to 50.0 µIU/mL.
In Study Two, serum samples covering the low end of the assay measuring range were used
for the linearity determination. A native serum sample containing a low concentration of
TSH and the high sample (prepared at a concentration near 5 μIU/mL by spiking TSH
antigen into a low serum sample) were mixed to make nine sample concentrations (0.002 –
4.898 μIU/mL) to achieve concentrations that covered the low range of the assay. The low

sample was run in replicates of eight, and all other samples were run in replicates of four.
This study was run on one DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzer, using three reagent pack lots
and one calibrator lot. The deviation from linearity did not exceed 0.000001 μIU/mL for
values ≤ 0.02 μIU/mL or 6% for values > 0.02 μIU/mL. The results support the Access TSH
(3rd IS) assay’s claimed measuring range of 0.01 to 50.0 µIU/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The sponsor stated that the reagents for the Access TSH (3rd IS) reagent are unchanged in
this submission. Therefore, specificity as reviewed in K153651 is adequate to describe the
specificity of the candidate test system.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See section VII.A.2 Linearity.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The measurand (TSH) in the Access TSH (3rd IS) Calibrator is traceable to WHO 3rd
International Reference Preparation, (NIBSC Coded 81/565).
6. Detection Limit:
i. Limit of Blank (LoB)
The LoB study was run on three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzers, using three reagent
pack lots and one calibrator lot. Four S0 calibrator lots were used as sample for the LoB
determination. Samples were tested over three days one run per day, five replicates per
run, for each pack lot for a total of 180 replicates. The LoB was calculated for each lot and
determined to be 0.002 μIU/mL using the 95% non-parametric percentile of the replicates
for each of three reagent lots.
ii. Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD study was run using eight serum samples with low TSH concentrations on three
DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzers, using three reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. In
total, forty-five (45) replicates (nine replicates per day over five days) of each of the eight
low serum samples were measured for the LoD determination. The LoD was calculated for
each lot and determined to be 0.003 μIU/mL based on the precision model, multiplied by
the 95th percentile of the standard normal distribution and added to the LoB to calculate the
LoD.
iii. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The LoQ study was run using thirteen serum samples with low TSH concentrations.
Samples were tested on three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzers, using three reagent pack
lots and one calibrator lot. Each of the samples were run in replicates of nine, in one run per

--- Page 10 ---
day, for five days on three reagent pack lots (45 replicates of each sample on each reagent
lot). In total, one hundred thirty-five (135) replicates of each of the thirteen serum samples
were measured for the LoQ determination. A variance components model was used to
estimate the %CV for each sample on each instrument and reagent lot combination. A log-
log quadratic precision profile model was fitted to between-run %CV versus observed
sample mean. The fitted precision profile was used to calculate the 10% CV LoQ for each
combination of reagent lot and instrument. The claimed LoQ value is 0.003 uIU/mL.
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ
Access TSH (3rd IS) 0.002 μIU/mL 0.003 μIU/mL 0.003 μIU/mL
These studies support the Access TSH (3rd IS) assay’s claimed measuring range of 0.01 to
50.0 µIU/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
See Section VII B1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device.
9. Carry-Over:
The DxI 9000 analyzer utilizes disposable pipette tips when aspirating and dispensing
samples to minimize carryover associated with samples containing high concentrations of
analyte. Studies were conducted to measure and assess the risk of carryover on the DxI 9000
Access Immunoassay Analyzer. The results of the studies support that the risk of carryover
based on the analyzer’s design has been appropriately mitigated.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed comparing the Access TSH (3rd IS) assay on the
DxI 9000 analyzer to the comparator device, the Access TSH (3rd IS) assay on the Access 2
Immunoassay System. A total of one hundred eleven (111) native serum samples were
evaluated. The study was run on three DxI 9000 instruments and three Access 2 instruments
with three reagent pack lots and three calibrator lots. The Passing-Bablok regression analysis
results between Access TSH (3rd IS) DxI 9000 analyzer values (dependent variable, y) and
the Access TSH (3rd IS) assay on the Access 2 Immunoassay System values (x, comparator),
