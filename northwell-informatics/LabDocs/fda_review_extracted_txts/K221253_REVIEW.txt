VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and reproducibility of results obtained with the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and
Negative Controls was evaluated using three lots of finished material that were tested with
multiple lots of SPOTFIRE R Panel reagents, over multiple days, with multiple operators and
using multiple BioFire SpotFire Systems, as follows.
External Sites
Testing was performed at 5 sites that were representative of the Intended Use
environment for the SPOTFIRE R Panel (i.e., sites performing near-patient testing). The
SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls were tested according to the SPOTFIRE
R Panel instructions for use as intended during normal, day-to-day operations (e.g.,
training a new operator, upon receipt of new reagents or a new instrument, or following
instrument service). The number of control panels tested varied by site according to the
number of operators and volume of SPOTFIRE R Panel testing performed. A total of 37
SPOTFIRE instruments were used across the 5 study sites in conjunction with 25 lots of
SPOTFIRE R Panel pouches.
Internal Maine Molecular Site
Testing of the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls internally at Maine
Molecular Quality Controls was performed over multiple days on a single SPOTFIRE
instrument by 3 operators using 3 lots of control panels and 3 lots of SPOTFIRE R Panel
pouches.
In total, 361 controls were tested across all sites, including 179 Positive Controls and 182
Negative Controls (Table 2). There were 10 invalid results affecting 7 Positive Controls and
3 Negative Controls (7 due to internal pouch control failure and 3 due to instrument errors).

All controls with invalid results were retested yielding a total of 351 valid control results
(172 Positive Controls and 179 Negative Controls). One Positive Control failed because
negative results were obtained for 4 of the target analytes. All other control results were as
expected. The overall Positive Control failure rate was 0.6% (1/172).
The reproducibility and precision of the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls was
acceptable.
