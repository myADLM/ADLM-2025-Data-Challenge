B Indication(s) for Use:
AI100 with Shonit is a cell locating device intended for in-vitro diagnostic use in clinical
laboratories.
AI100 with Shonit is intended for differential count of White Blood Cells (WBC),
characterization of Red Blood Cells (RBC) morphology and Platelet morphology. It
automatically locates blood cells on peripheral blood smears and presents images of the blood
cells for review.
A skilled operator, trained in the use of the device and in the review of blood cells, identifies and
classifies each cell according to type.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The AI100 with Shonit device consists of a high-resolution microscope with LED illumination,
and compute parts such as the motherboard, CPU, RAM, Wi-Fi dongle, solid state drive (SSD)
containing AI100 with Shonit software, motorized XYZ stage, a camera with firmware,
Programmable Circuit Board (PCB) and its firmware for driving motor and LED, Switched-
mode power supply (SMPS), power supply and a casing. It is capable of handling one Peripheral
Blood Smear (PBS) slide at a time. Romanowsky stains are used with the device.
The device moves the peripheral whole blood smear slide to the imaging area and performs pre-
scan steps which involve identifying the optimal area of the smear for scanning. If the optimal
area is not found, the slide is rejected, and the user is notified with appropriate error messages. If
an optimal area is identified, scanning (capturing FOV images) proceeds from the center of the
optimal area in an outward spiral fashion. Focusing is done at each image location to capture the
most optimal image. The image at each field of view (FOV) is checked to ensure appropriate
quality for image processing. The scan stops when the required number of FOVs are captured or
required number of white blood cells (WBCs) are encountered, depending on the scan mode
selected by the user. On each FOV image, image processing is applied to extract and classify
WBCs, red blood cells (RBCs), and platelets.
WBCs are classified into Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils,
Immature Granulocytes (IGs), Atypical Cells/Blasts and Nucleated Red Blood Cell (NRBCs).
RBCs are classified according to size (Normocyte, Round Macrocyte, Ovalo Macrocyte,
Microcyte) and shape (Normal, Target, Teardrop, Echinocyte, Elliptocyte, Ovalocyte,
Fragmented). Platelets are classified into Normal, Large, Giant Platelets and Platelet Clumps.
The device then allows the user to review the identified and classified cells, including cells that
could not be classified and generate a microscopy report. Users may re-classify cells and add
comments before approving the report.

B Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
AI100 with Shonit
2. Specimen Identification:
The slide’s barcode is captured scanned and assigned to each case. The device also supports
typing the barcode manually.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A peripheral blood sample is collected in K2EDTA tubes. A thin blood film is wedged on a
clean dry glass slide (a blood smear) and stained with Romanowsky stain. The slide is put on
the stage for image capture.
4. Calibration:
The device calibration should be performed by the SigTuple support team or by the end
user/customer under the guidance of the SigTuple support team with Operational
Qualification (OQ) slide every 6 months. Device calibration should be conducted:
• Once every six months
• After the device has been serviced
• When a new OQ slide is provided
5. Quality Control:
The AI100 with Shonit device performs self-test during startup after powering up or reset of
the system. On startup, all software components and hardware components are checked and
confirmed to behave normally before system is allowed to start a peripheral blood smear
(PBS) scan. The quality is checked by performing the Operational Qualification (OQ) test
and the Performance Qualification (PQ) test. Both tests use the OQ quality control slide. The
OQ test should be conducted every three (3) months. In the OQ test, the parameters which
determine functional and device performance metrics are tested automatically in a sequential
order. The PQ test is for parameters which directly impact the image analysis and they are
tested automatically in a sequential order. The PQ test should be conducted daily.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Not applicable.
4. Accuracy (Instrument):
A method comparison study was conducted at four (4) sites comparing the AI100 with Shonit
to manual microscopy. A total of 882 samples were collected encompassing healthy subjects
and patients with specific disease conditions. Blood samples (K EDTA) were collected, and
2
one peripheral blood smear (PBS) slide was prepared for each sample (Romanowsky stain).
The slides were randomly selected, blinded and evaluated by two examiners at each site.
Passing-Bablok Regression analysis was performed for WBC differential and overall
agreement, sensitivity and specificity were measured for WBC Distributional and
Morphological abnormalities. Overall agreement, sensitivity and specificity were evaluated
for RBC and PLT morphology. Calculations of 95% confidence intervals are also provided.
The study met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
