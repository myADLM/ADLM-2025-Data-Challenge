causing shortened red blood cell survival, such as hemolytic diseases, pregnancy and
significant acute or chronic blood loss.
• This HbA1c test should not be used in monitoring daily glucose control and should not be
used to replace daily home testing of urine and blood glucose levels.
• This HbA1c test is not intended for use in the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes.
• This HbA1c test is not intended for use on neonates.
• This device has significant negative interference with fetal hemoglobin (HbF). HbA1c results
are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF, including those with known
Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The Nova Allegro HbA1c Assay is used with the Nova Allegro Analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Nova Allegro HbA1c Assay is a fully automated assay for the determination of the
percentage of HbA1c in capillary fingerstick whole blood and the calculation of estimated
average glucose (eAG). The Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridge contains all reagents required for
the determination of % HbA1c and includes an integrated capillary sample collection device.
K221326 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
The sample material is collected with the capillary sample device and the capillary device is
inserted back into the test cartridge before the test cartridge is inserted into the Allegro
Analyzer. The Test Cartridge has a barcode label with lot specific information.
Estimated Average Glucose is the average glucose levels for the past 60 to 90 days calculated
using the following NGSP1 recommended formula: eAG (mg/dl) = 28.7 × A1C − 46.7.
1Harmonizing Hemoglobin A1c Testing, https://ngsp.org/A1ceAG.asp
The Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridge contains the following:
• Reagent 1 - Lysis solution containing a small concentration of detergent and Azide in
water
• Reagent 2 - Polystyrene latex particles in water
• Reagent 3 - Mouse monoclonal antibody in a buffered solution containing salts and
Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)
• Reagent 4 - Goat polyclonal antibody in a buffered solution containing salts and Bovine
Albumin (BSA)
The Nova Allegro Analyzer is a compact multi-assay analyzer for point-of-care testing, designed
to work with Nova Allegro Test Cartridges. The analyzer supports multiple wavelengths that are
used to measure the assay of interest. The analyzer contains two analytical bays where the single-
use test cartridges are analyzed. Only the right cartridge bay of the Allegro Analyzer can be used
with Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridges. When the HbA1c test cartridge bar code is scanned for
analysis, the right bay of the analyzer will open. To support the HbA1c Assay, the instrument has
a control feature to ensure for the correct sample type and sample volume.
B Principle of Operation:
The Nova Allegro HbA1c test cartridge measures the total glycated hemoglobin and the total
hemoglobin concentration. The ratio between them is proportional to the % HbA1c of the
sample. The analyzer calculates the ratio. A whole blood sample containing hemoglobin A1c and
total hemoglobin are nonspecifically absorbed to latex particles. The anti-human mouse HbA1c
antibody reacts to form a complex. Agglutination occurs when polyclonal antibody specifically
reacts with the mouse antibody bound to the hemoglobin A1c on the surface of the latex
particles. The amount of agglutination is measured as absorbance. The HbA1c value is obtained
from a stored calibration curve and displayed on the Nova Allegro Analyzer.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Nova Allegro Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification can be done by scanning a patient identification bar code or by
manual entry.
K221326 - Page 3 of 13

--- Page 4 ---
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A single-use, disposable capillary sample collection device, which is part of the HbA1c
Assay Test Cartridge, is used to obtain 1.5 μL fingerstick capillary whole blood to the test
cartridge. The capillary sample collection device containing the blood is inserted into the
HbA1c test cartridge, then the test cartridge is placed into the sample bay within 1 minute of
sample collection and the start icon is pressed to start analysis.
4. Calibration:
The reagent test cartridge includes a scannable 2D barcode containing the stored calibration
curve. The HbA1c value is obtained using the stored calibration curve and is displayed on the
Nova Allegro Analyzer.
5. Quality Control:
External Quality Control (QC) material is used to monitor the performance of the analyzer
and the test cartridges used with the analyzer and to verify the analyzer is performing to
specifications. QC recommendations are found in the labeling.

5-Day Imprecision (Venous Whole Blood)
The sponsor provided a precision study using venous whole blood, a validated surrogate for
the intended use sample. The sponsor additionally provided data to support that venous blood
samples did not behave differently from capillary whole blood samples. Three K2EDTA
venous whole blood samples were analyzed for five days in duplicate four times a day (total
of forty measurements per sample) at four sites, using three different HbA1c test cartridge
lots and three different operators at each site. Each site used its own venous whole blood
samples; therefore, only individual site analysis was performed for the blood samples and are

2. Linearity:
A study was performed using 11 whole blood samples with HbA1c concentrations
spanning 4.0% to 15.4%. The 11 samples were created by mixing varying aliquots of a
low and a high concentration sample. Each sample was assayed in replicates of four on
one Nova Allegro Analyzer using one lot of Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridges and the mean
of replicates was compared to results obtained on the Tosoh G8 analyzer. The results from
linear regression results are shown below:
Analyte Range Tested (%) Levels Slope Intercept r
HbA1c 4.0 - 15.4 11 1.016 -0.14 0.999
All deviations from linearity were within ±5%. The results of the linearity study support the
sponsor’s claim that the Nova Allegro HbA1c Assay on the Nova Allegro Analyzer is linear
across the measuring range of 4.0 -14.0 % HbA1c. If a test result is outside the Allegro’s
measuring range, the analyzer will not display a HbA1c result. The analyzer screen shows a
red bar graph flag and <4.0% or >14.0% are displayed. The analyzer printout shows 3 down
arrows or 3 up arrows and <4.0% or >14.0% are displayed on the printout. This function
was validated and demonstrated to function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Studies were performed to evaluate the impact of common endogenous and exogenous
substances in the intended use population on Nova Allegro HbA1c Assay results. Whole
blood samples containing HbA1c at two levels (5.4 - 6.6% HbA1c and 8.6 – 10.3% HbA1c)
were split into test samples containing potential interfering substances and control specimens
without the interfering substance. Test samples were assayed in replicates of 10 and the mean
concentration for each test sample was compared to the mean concentration of 10 replicates
of the control sample. Two Nova Allegro Analyzers and one lot of Nova Allegro HbA1c Test
Cartridges were used. The highest tested concentrations at which no significant interference
was observed (defined by the sponsor as less than ±10% difference between the test and
control samples) are presented in the following table:

Hemoglobin Interference
A study was performed to test the impact of hemoglobin on the Nova Allegro HbA1c Assay
using six (6) Allegro Analyzers and one (1) lot of reagents. Fifteen venous whole blood
specimens with HbA1c concentrations from 5.0 to 11.0 % and hemoglobin concentrations
from 10.8 to 14.6 g/dL were prepared to contain hemoglobin at target levels of 5.5 and 20.5
g/dL. The average of three (3) replicates of each blood sample was compared to the average
neat HbAlc sample result. The results demonstrated that no significant interference (defined
by the sponsor as less than ±10% interference between the test and control samples) was
observed from total hemoglobin levels between 6 and 20 g/dL. The Allegro Analyzer will not
generate HbA1c results with samples containing hemoglobin concentrations outside of 6.0 -
20.0 mg/dL and will display the error code “HbA1c Bad Sample”. This feature was validated
and was shown to function as intended.
Cross-Reactivity
Potential cross reactivity from HbA0, HbA1a and HbA1b was evaluated using 226 samples
with HbA1c concentrations ranging from 4.9-12.2% and containing HbA0 (83.8-93.5%),
HbA1a (0.3-1.6%), HbA1b (0.4-1.7%). Samples were tested using the Allegro Analyzer and
results compared to measurements obtained on the Tosoh G8 analyzer.
Results are summarized below.
Potential Highest Level Tested
Interferent with No Significant
Interference
HbA0 Up to 93.5%
HbA1a Up to 1.6%
HbA1b Up to 1.7%
Hemoglobin Derivatives
Potential interference from hemoglobin derivatives with the Nova Allegro HbA1c Assay was
evaluated. Two Nova Allegro Analyzers and one lot of Nova Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridges
were used to assess venous whole blood specimens at target levels of 5.5 and 8.0 % HbA1c.
Each blood sample was divided into a control sample and a test sample, and each was
assessed in replicates of 10. Glycated albumin samples were derived with glycated human
albumin. Acetylated hemoglobin was derived in the presence of acetylsalicyclic acid,
carbamylated hemoglobin was derived in the presence of sodium cyanate, and labile A1c was
derived in the presence of glucose. The sponsor defined no-significant interference as
≤±10% difference between the test and control samples and concluded that the following do
not interfere with the Nova Allegro HbA1c assay: 50 mg/mL glycated albumin, 50 mg/mL
acetylated hemoglobin, 0.5 mg/mL carbamylated hemoglobin, 20 mg/mL labile hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin variant interference
A study was performed to assess potential interference from hemoglobin variants (HbA2,
HbC, HbD, HbE, HbS, and HbF) on the Nova HbA1c Assay using two Nova Allegro
Analyzers and one lot of Nova Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridges. One hundred and nineteen

(119) venous whole blood samples were measured in this study, 20 samples for each HbC,
HbD, HbE and HbF, 25 samples for HbS, and 14 samples for HbA2. Samples were measured
on the Nova Allegro Analyzer and compared to results obtained by an FDA cleared
comparator method that has been demonstrated to be free from the hemoglobin variant
interference. The following tables summarize the samples and study results:

interference for samples containing Hemoglobin C (≤ 38.2%), Hemoglobin D (≤41.1%),
Hemoglobin E (≤27.9%), Hemoglobin S (≤ 38.6%), and Hemoglobin A2 (≤ 6.5%).
The following warning is included in the Nova Allegro HbA1c Assay package insert:
This device has significant negative interference with Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF). HbA1c
results are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF, including those with
known Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.

matched K2EDTA venous whole blood samples on an FDA cleared comparator method run
at a NGSP secondary reference laboratory. A total of eight Allegro Analyzers (2 per site)
and three lots of Allegro HbA1c Test Cartridges were used in the study. A Passing-Bablok
regression analysis was performed using 526 paired results. Seven results were out of the
analytical measuring range and were excluded from the regression analysis. The Passing-
Bablok regression results are shown below:

D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The labeling states the following.
In 2023, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended a reasonable A1c goal for
many non-pregnant adults is < 7% (53 mmol/mol) without significant hypoglycemia. On the
basis of health care professional judgment and patient preference, achievement of lower A1c
levels than the goal of 7% may be acceptable and even beneficial if it can be achieved safely
without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Less stringent A1c goals
(such as <8% [64 mmol/mol]) may be appropriate for patients with limited life expectancy or
where the harms of treatment are greater than the benefits. Health care professionals should
consider deintensification of therapy if appropriate to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in patients
with inappropriate stringent A1c targets.1
