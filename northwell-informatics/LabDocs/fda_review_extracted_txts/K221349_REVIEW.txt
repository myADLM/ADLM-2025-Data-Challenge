D Special Instrument Requirements:
XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Meter
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the
handheld XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Meter and the XPER Technology
PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Test Strips. The TaiDoc Blood Glucose Control Solutions
(Levels Y1, W2, B3) are sold separately.
B Principle of Operation:
The XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is designed to
quantitatively measure the amount of blood sugar (glucose) in fresh capillary whole blood from
fingertips. The blood sample is pulled into the test strip by capillary action. The glucose
measurement is based on the amperometry achieved with the glucose dehydrogenase enzyme
(GDH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent based chemistry. The glucose in the
sample reacts with GDH to produce electrons that are transferred to the electrodes via FAD and a
mediator. The resulting electric current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the
sample. After the reaction the meter calculates the detected current and reports the glucose
concentration in plasma equivalents.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Meter
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary fingerstick whole blood. The blood
sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.

--- Page 4 ---
4. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The detection of the calibration
code is automatic.
5. Quality Control:
Three levels of TaiDoc Blood Glucose Control Solutions (Y1, W2, B3) are available for use
with the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Instructions
on how to order control solutions, and when to perform a control solution test are included in
the labeling. The acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip bottle or
on the bottom of the test strip box. The meter automatically recognizes and flags the test
result in the memory as a control solution test result. The user is cautioned not to use the
meter and to contact the customer support if the control result falls outside the ranges printed
on the test strip vial label.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System was
evaluated using venous whole blood spiked with high concentration glucose solution or
allowed to glycolyze to achieve 11 glucose concentrations (9, 49, 78, 101, 137, 189, 287,
394, 588, 737 and 888 mg/dL). The target glucose concentrations were verified by the
comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Results on the candidate device were compared to
results on the comparator. Each glucose level was tested using three test strip lots and five
meters, for a total of 15 replicates per level and a total of 165 results.
The results are summarized below:
Test Strip Lot # Slope y-intercept R2-value
Lot 1 1.0098 1.5666 0.9991
Lot 2 1.0128 0.6173 0.9992
Lot 3 1.0112 1.0187 0.9988
Combined 1.0113 1.0675 0.9991
The results of the study support linearity of the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood
Glucose Monitoring System across the claimed measuring range of 10 to 800 mg/dL. If the
concentration of a sample is less than 10 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as
“Lo”. If a sample exceeds 800 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as “Hi”. The
“Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference testing was conducted to evaluate the effect of common endogenous substances
and exogenous substances expected in the intended use population on the XPER Technology
PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Additional potential interferents were
included in the testing following a detailed analysis of medications and medical conditions of
the subjects evaluated in the method comparison study (see Section VII.C.3 below). The
study was conducted by spiking 58 exogenous and endogenous substances into venous whole
blood adjusted to three glucose levels (50 to 70, 110 to 130, and 225 to 270 mg/dL; as
measured by the laboratory comparator method). Each of these samples was divided into a
test pool and a control pool, with the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering

The performance of the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring
System was established in the intended use environment using capillary fingerstick samples
from 414 patients between the ages of 18 to 82 at 9 intended use settings that are
representative of point-of-care settings with point-of-care operators.
The glucose levels tested ranged from 63 to 579 mg/L, with 24 results below 80 mg/dL and
24 results above 300 mg/dL. Testing was performed on 9 lots of XPER Technology
PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Test Strips using 35 XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro
Blood Glucose Meters. The clinical study included subjects that are representative of the
intended patient population receiving a total of 69 unique medications representing 17 main
drug classes.
The XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring results were compared to
the YSI 2300 STAT Plus as the comparator method and the results from the clinical sites
combined and presented below:

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of hematocrit on the performance of the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood
Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with
hematocrit levels of 20 to 70 % (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 42, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 %),
and at 7 glucose concentrations (10 to 30, 31 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250, 251 to
400, and 600 to 800 mg/dL). The results obtained with the candidate system were compared
to those obtained with the laboratory comparator method. The results of the study
demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of 10 to 70%.
2. Altitude Study:
A simulated high-altitude study was conducted in a pressure chamber to simulate the effects
of 4 altitudes from sea level (0 ft) and high-altitude (15,000 ft) on the XPER Technology
PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples adjusted to
7 glucose concentrations ranging from 62 to 581 mg/dL. The results of obtained with the

The results support the claims that the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose
Monitoring System blood glucose monitoring system functions as intended at altitudes up to
the claimed altitude of 15,000 ft.
3. System Operating Conditions:
To evaluate device performance over varying operating temperature and humidity conditions,
venous whole blood samples were adjusted to 3 glucose levels (65, 125, and 320 mg/dL).
Testing was conducted under 4 combinations of temperature and relative humidity (RH)
including 117°F (47°C) and 43°F (6°C) and 8% and 92% RH, and under the nominal
condition of 77°F (25°C) at 60% RH. The results obtained with the candidate system were
compared to those obtained with the comparator method. The results support the claims in
the labeling that the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System
blood glucose monitoring system can be used in conditions of 46 to 113°F (8 to 45°C) with
relative humidity of 10% to 90%.
4. Sample Volume Study:
The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5 μL for
the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous whole
blood samples with 3 glucose concentration ranges (50 to 65, 100 to 120 and 200 to 250
mg/dL) were tested at six sample volumes (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 μL) using three lots
of test strips. Values obtained were compared to the comparator method. The sponsor
provided validation studies demonstrating that with blood volumes below 0.5 μL, the
insufficient sample volume error message functioned as intended. Results support the
claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5 μL for the system.
5. Flex Studies:
The following additional flex studies were performed with the candidate system: drop/shock,
early test strip removal, intermittent sampling, sample outside measuring range, sample
perturbation, shipping, used test strips, incorrect test strips and vibration testing. The results
demonstrated that the performance of the XPER Technology PREMIUM Pro Blood Glucose
Monitoring System is robust under these expected use conditions.
6. Infection Control Testing:
The device is intended for multiple-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed
on the exterior meter materials by an outside commercial testing laboratory, demonstrating
complete inactivation of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant Clorox
HealthcareTM Bleach Germicidal Wipe (EPA No.: 67619-12). Robustness studies were also
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external
materials of the meter after 27,500 cycles of cleaning and disinfection using the chosen
disinfectant. The robustness studies were designed to simulate cleaning and disinfection over
the 5-year multi-patient use life of the meter. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
7. Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed and the system was found
to be compliant.
