III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
For the quantitative measurement of OC 125 defined antigen concentration in human serum and
plasma (EDTA or heparin) using the VITROS 5600 Integrated System. The VITROS CA 125 II
assay is to be used as an aid in monitoring response to therapy for patients with epithelial ovarian
cancer. Serial testing for patient CA 125 assay concentrations should be used in conjunction with
other clinical methods used for monitoring ovarian cancer.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as Intended Use
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Different test methods cannot be used interchangeably. OC 125 defined antigen in a given
patient sample determined with different tests and from different manufacturers can vary due to
differences in test methods and reagent specificity. A change to the test used during serial
monitoring of a patient should be accompanied by additional sequential testing to confirm
baseline concentrations. The results reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the
identity of the CA 125 II test used.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITROS 5600 Integrated System (K081543)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack is supplied ready for use and
contains:
• 100 coated wells (antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-OC 125, binds >32.5 U per well)
• 9.4 mL conjugate reagent (Horseradish Peroxidase labeled mouse monoclonal anti-OC
125, binds ≥542 U/mL) in buffer with bovine serum albumin, bovine gamma globulin
and antimicrobial agent
• 9.4 mL assay reagent (buffer containing bovine serum albumin, bovine gamma globulin
and antimicrobial agent)
VITROS CA 125 II Calibrators are supplied ready to use and contains:
• 1 set of VITROS CA 125 II calibrators with 1, 2 and 3 levels (OC 125 defined antigen in
buffer with bovine serum albumin and antimicrobial agent, 1.75 mL); target values 24.0;
130 and 875 U/mL
• Lot calibration card
• Protocol card
K221355 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
• 24 calibrator bar code labels (8 for each calibrator)
The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack has been modified from the
previously cleared assay which is susceptible to interference from biotin. The modification was
made to allow the biotinylated antibody capture conjugate to be pre-bound to the well, which
eliminates the risk of biotin interference.
B Principle of Operation:
An immunometric chemiluminescent immunoassay is used. OC 125 defined antigen present in
the sample reacts with a biotinylated antibody (mouse anti-OC 125) bound to streptavidin on a
microwell. Unbound sample is removed by washing. In a second incubation, a horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti-OC 125) binds to the
immobilized OC 125 antigen. Unbound materials are removed by washing. The bound HRP
conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a
luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The
HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light.
The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and
prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The amount of HRP conjugate
bound is directly proportional to the concentration of OC 125 present.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack was
evaluated by testing a panel of six serum samples on one VITROS 5600 System using three
reagent lots. The samples with OC 125 concentrations had target concentrations of 8, 30,
100, 260, 400 and 800 U/mL. Each sample was tested in two replicates per run, two runs per
day, for 20 days, yielding a total of 80 measurements for each reagent lot. Imprecision was
calculated by combining the data for three reagent lots (N=240 datapoint/sample). The results
are summarized in the table below:

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was performed according to CLSI EP06-A2. One pool of human sera with
OC 125 concentration above 1000 U/mL was mixed with a serum pool that had been stripped
of OC 125 to produce a series of 15 dilution samples. Each dilution sample was tested in five
replicates on one VITROS 5600 System using one reagent lot of the VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack. The results are summarized in the table
below.

The results support the linearity of the following claimed analytical measuring range (AMR):
5 – 1000 U/mL.
3. Dilution study:
For automatic dilution, five samples were diluted on the VITROS 5600 System using
VITROS High Sample Diluent B (HSDB). Each sample was diluted 1:20 (1-part sample to

19-parts diluent) and run in five replicates, on one reagent lot of the updated VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack and one lot of the predicate using one
VITROS 5600 System. The percent recovery results on the updated reagent lot were
compared to the percent recoveries obtained on the predicate lot. The results support an
automatic sample dilution ratio of 1:20 for the updated VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products
CA 125 II Reagent Pack.
4. Analytical specificity/interference:
Potential interfering and cross-reacting substances were tested for their ability to cross react
or interfere with the performance of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II
Reagent Pack using procedures based on the guidelines CLSI EP07 and CLSI EP37.
Each potential interfering substance was tested at two analyte concentrations: ~10 U/mL and
~50 U/mL. Test samples were prepared by spiking with the potential endogenous and
exogenous interfering substances at two different levels (low level of interferant and high
level of interferant). Results were compared to matched control samples which were spiked
with an equal volume of solvent (blank). The CA 125 in the test samples and control samples
were measured in five replicates using each of three reagent lots on the VITROS 5600
System. The recovery was calculated by comparing measurements of the test and control
samples. No interference (≤ ±10% difference of test from control) for the VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack up to the concentrations of the potential
interfering substances tested as shown in the table below:

Shelf-life (unopened) of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack
was evaluated using three lots of kit reagents according to the recommendation of CLSI
EP25-A. Each lot was stored at 2–8°C and tested in four runs at baseline and monthly
thereafter for 12 months with one month post expiration. The data support a shelf-life of
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack up to four months (16 weeks)
weeks when stored at 2–8°C.
Opened in-use stability of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack
was assessed using three lots of kit reagents stored in on-board conditions. Each lot was
tested in four runs at baseline and six additional time points over 8 weeks. Fresh reagent
packs were tested at each time point as reference. The data support an on-board stability of
the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack up to 7 weeks.
Additionally, reagent packs, when stored open off-board the VITROS systems are required to
be stored in reagent pack boxes containing dried desiccant at 2–8°C. These are hermetically
sealed containers, which are not subject to varying humidity levels or environmental
influences that may be experienced during open, on-system storage. Therefore, the open, on-
board system storage stability provides worst case conditions and as a consequence, the open
off-storage claim is restricted to that supported by the Open, On-board Stability trial (up to 7
weeks).
The stability of calibrator and sample stability were previously established per K983875.
7. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack were verified based on the
CLSI EP17 guideline.
The LoB was determined by testing four analyte stripped serum pools containing no
measurable CA 125 using three reagent lots. For each lot, LoB samples were run in two
replicates per run, two runs per day, for five days yielding a total of 80 replicates per lot. LoB
was defined as the value corresponding to the 95th percentile of the rank position of the
distribution of values. The highest LoB value observed across three reagent lots was 0.2
U/mL. The claimed LoB is 0.2 U/mL
The LoD was determined by testing five samples containing low levels of CA 125 at 1 to 5
times the LoB concentration using three reagent lots. For each lot, the samples were run in
six replicates per run, two runs per day for five days yielding a total of 300 replicates per lot.
The LoD was calculated using a parametric approach. The highest LoD value observed
across lots was 0.5 U/mL. The claimed LoD is 5.5 U/mL.
The LoQ was determined based on the study data from the LoD study described above and
defined as the lowest value with precision less than or equal to the precision of 20% CV. The
highest LoQ value observed across lots was 0.7 U/mL. The result support the claimed LoQ as
5.5 U/mL.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The references range for the unmodified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II
Reagent Pack (predicate) was previously established based on a study of testing 200 samples
from normal females. The results indicated that 98.5% (197 out of 200) of the samples were
found to be ≤ 35 U/mL of CA 125.
To verify this reference range, serum samples from a total of 120 apparently healthy non-
smoking individuals including 30 females less than 50 years of age, 30 females more than 50
years of age and 60 males less than 50 years of age were each tested on three lots of the modified
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack (candidate device) according to
CLSI EP28-A3c. Only one female sample was found to be > 35 U/mL. The rest of the female
samples (98.3%) are all < 35 U/mL across three lots.
The labeling of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 125 II Reagent Pack includes the
following expected values (refer to K983875) for CA 125 in malignant and non-malignant
conditions, in addition to the values for CA 125 in healthy subjects:
CA 125 Concentration

≤ 35 U/mL 35.1–65 U/mL 65.1–100 U/mL > 100 U/mL
Malignant Disease
Ovarian 75 21 7 7 40
Gastrointestinal 30 21 2 1 6
