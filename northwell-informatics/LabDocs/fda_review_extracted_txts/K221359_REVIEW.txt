A Device Description:
Instrument
The ACL TOP 970 CL is a mid to large volume (80 sample capacity) bench-top, fully automatic,
random-access analyzer that is intended for analysis using both open and closed (capped) sample
K221359 - Page 2 of 16

--- Page 3 ---
tubes and having cap piercing capability. The ACL TOP 970 CL is an instrument that integrates
new chemiluminescent test capability similar to the ACL AcuStar, K083518.
Control Module (CM): The CM provides a user interface and operation control. It consists
of a personal computer running Windows 10 software, keyboard, touch screen display
monitor, mouse, and communications interfaces to the AM and external devices/systems. The
CM provides the major functionality associated with the user interface (UI) including data
management, data reduction, LIS (Laboratory Information System) communications, sample
identification, test materials management, fluid management, reporting, test tracking and QC
management, and monitoring.
Analytical Module (AM): The AM consists primarily of sample and reagent handling
hardware. It processes reagents and auxiliary materials. It consists of the following
subsystem:
• CL System: This subsystem of the instrument performs chemiluminescence testing.
This includes the cartridge-based CL reagent loading area, magnetic wash stations
and the Luminometer. It is located on the right side of the instrument. The CL System
module of the ACL TOP 970 CL is based on the ACL AcuStar (K083518), with the
same reagent cartridge formulation for the HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM and
HemosIL CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM assays and the exact same calibrator
formulation. However, there are differences in software and hardware, as well as
packaging/container for calibrators and CL instrument rinse solution.
Assays
The HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM kit consists of:
• Anti-Cardiolipin IgM Cartridge for 50 determinations: 1 cartridge containing 1 vial of
magnetic particle suspension coated with bovine cardiolipin and human purified ß2 GPI,
1 vial of assay buffer, 1 vial of tracer consisting of an anti-human IgM antibody labeled
with isoluminol, and 1 vial of sample diluent. The reagents are in a phosphate or borate
buffer containing bovine serum albumin, bovine cardiolipin, human ß2GPI, mouse
monoclonal IgM, stabilizers, and preservative.
• aCL IgM Calibrator 1: 1 x 1.2 mL barcoded vial of a solution with aCL IgM in saline
solution containing bovine fetal serum, stabilizers, and preservative.
• aCL IgM Calibrator 2: 1 x 1.2 mL barcoded vial of a solution with aCL IgM in saline
solution containing bovine fetal serum, stabilizers, and preservative. The calibrators are
lot dependent and cannot be used with other lots of reagents.
The HemosIL CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM kit consists of:
• Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM Cartridge for 50 determinations: 1 cartridge containing 1 vial
of a magnetic particle suspension coated with human purified ß2GPI, 1 vial of assay
buffer, 1 vial of tracer consisting of an anti- human IgM antibody labeled with
isoluminol, and 1 vial of sample diluent. The reagents are in a phosphate buffer
containing bovine serum albumin, human ß2GPI, mouse monoclonal IgM, stabilizers,
and preservative.
• Anti-ß2 GPI IgM Calibrator 1: 1 x 1.2 mL barcoded vial of a solution with aß2 GPI IgM
in a phosphate buffer containing bovine serum albumin, stabilizers, and preservative.
K221359 - Page 3 of 16

• Anti-ß2 GPI IgM Calibrator 2: 1 x 1.2 mL barcoded vial of a solution with aß2 GPI IgM
in a phosphate buffer containing bovine serum albumin, stabilizers, and preservative. The
calibrators are lot dependent and cannot be used with other lots of reagents.
B Principle of Operation:
The ACL TOP 970 CL instrument performs chemiluminescence measurements.
Assays:
HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM
HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM is a chemiluminescent two-step immunoassay consisting of
magnetic particles coated with cardiolipin and human purified ß2 Glycoprotein-I, which capture,
if present, the anti-cardiolipin antibodies from the sample. After incubation, magnetic separation,
and a wash step, a tracer consisting of an isoluminol-labeled anti-human IgM antibody is added
and may bind with the captured anti-cardiolipin IgM on the particles. After a second incubation,
magnetic separation, and wash step, reagents that trigger the luminescent reaction are added, and
the emitted light is measured as relative light units (RLU) by the ACL TOP 970 CL optical
system. RLUs are directly proportional to the anti-cardiolipin IgM concentration in the sample.
The HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM assay utilizes a 4 Parameter Logistic Curve (4PLC) fit
data reduction method to generate a Master Curve. The Master Curve is predefined, lot
dependent, and is stored in the instrument through the cartridge barcode. With the measurement
of calibrators, the predefined Master Curve is transformed to a new, instrument-specific 4PLC
Working Curve. The concentration values of the calibrators are included in the reagent kit
calibrator value sheet 2D barcode.
HemosIL CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM
HemosIL CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM is a chemiluminescent two-step immunoassay
consisting of magnetic particles coated with human purified anti-ß2 glycoprotein-I, which
capture, if present, the anti-ß2 glycoprotein-I antibodies from the sample. After incubation,
magnetic separation, and a wash step, a tracer consisting of an isoluminol-labeled anti-human
IgM antibody is added and may bind with the captured anti-ß2 glycoprotein-I IgM on the
particles. After a second incubation, magnetic separation, and wash step, reagents that trigger the
luminescent reaction are added, and the emitted light is measured as relative light units (RLUs)
by the ACL TOP 970 CL optical system. RLUs are directly proportional to the anti-ß2
glycoprotein-I IgM concentration in the sample.
The HemosIL CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM assay utilizes a 4 Parameter Logistic Curve
(4PLC) fit data reduction method to generate a Master Curve. The Master Curve is predefined,
lot dependent and is stored in the instrument through the cartridge barcode. With the
measurement of calibrators, the predefined Master Curve is transformed to a new, instrument-
specific 4PLC Working Curve. The concentration values of the calibrators are included in the
reagent kit calibrator value sheet 2D barcode.

--- Page 5 ---
1. Instrument Name:
ACL TOP 970 CL
2. Specimen Identification:
Samples, reagents, and diluents are identified by a barcode reader.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Draw blood into tubes containing 3.2% or 3.8% sodium citrate. Using other anticoagulants
may cause invalid results. Note: Unless specifically directed, using a discard tube is not
necessary before collecting a citrated plasma sample. Fill to the proper level, indicated by a
fill line on the tube. Gently invert six times to mix. Process immediately.
4. Calibration:
The ACL TOP 970 CL instrument makes dilutions, adds reagents, and takes readings, then
generates a calibration curve. The instrument can store the ten most recent calibrations.
However, only one calibration can be validated at any time.
5. Quality Control:
HemosIL CL Multi-Ab Low and High Controls are not supplied with the reagents or device
and must be purchased separately. The reported values were determined over multiple runs
on the ACL TOP 970 CL using specific lots of reagents and against an internal House
Standard. Following published recommendations,1 the units of the internal House Standard
for the aCL IgM and aß2 GPI IgM antibodies have been correlated with the reference
monoclonal antibody EY2C92. Controls should be analyzed at least once every 8 hours when
testing is taking place, in accordance with good laboratory practice. Control materials consist
of two levels at or near cut-off and at abnormal levels.

A multi-site reproducibility study was conducted to evaluate the reproducibility of HemosIL
CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM at three external US clinical sites using three different lots of
HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM with two controls (low and high) and four plasma sample
pools. Each material was tested in triplicate, twice a day for 5 days, for a total of 30
replicates per level. Instrument and operator variables were nested within the multiple site
component – i.e., a different operator and instrument was used at each of the three sites.

2. Linearity:
Linearity was assessed per CLSI EP06 (2ⁿᵈ Edition) using three different lots of HemosIL CL
Anti-Cardiolipin IgM and three different lots of HemosIL CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM
reagent cartridges. For each assay, a set of 11 linearity samples were prepared by diluting a
high antibody plasma sample with a negative antibody plasma sample to create the required
sample concentrations. Each level was measured in six replicates with three lots for each
assay. The linearity range was determined such that all acceptance criteria were met.
The results support the linearity of the claimed analytical measuring range: 2.7–500 U/mL
for HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM; 1.9–400.0 U/mL for HemosIL CL Anti-ß2
Glycoprotein-I IgM.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
An interference study was performed with three lots of HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM
and HemosIL CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM on an ACL TOP 970 CL. Three different
plasma samples at different antibody concentrations were tested. Normal pooled plasma
(Negative:< 20.0 U/mL): unadulterated APS positive donor sample diluted in a normal
pooled plasma (MDL: ~20.0 U/mL), and unadulterated APS positive donor sample (High
Positive: > 20.0 U/mL). A minimum of 14 replicates was ran for each sample and compared
to the control sample. Based on the results, the following tables display the highest
concentration in which ≤ ±10% interference was observed for the two assays.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay reportable range is as follows:
• HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM: 2.7–500 U/mL;
• HemosIL CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM: 1.9–400.0 U/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
International reference materials for anti-cardiolipin antibodies and anti-β2 glycoprotein-I
IgM antibodies are not available. The assays are calibrated in relative arbitrary units (U/mL).
The two calibrator values are assigned using in-house standards and a four parameter Master
Curve. The assignment values of the two calibrators are used to create a lot-specific four-
parameter logistic curve, using two stored parameters from the Master Curve and two lot-
specific parameters based on the calibrator values.
Sample Stability:
Refer to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Document H21, current edition,
for further instructions on specimen collection, handling, and storage.
Fresh versus Frozen Study
A fresh versus frozen 3.2% citrated plasma sample study was performed at four external US
sites to verify equivalence of the HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM and HemosIL CL Anti-
ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM measurement procedures when APS suspected specimens are tested
fresh and then across two freeze-thaw cycles on the ACL TOP 970 CL. The first aliquot of
fresh patient samples was tested in triplicate with the HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM and
the HemosIL CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM assays. For the first freeze-thaw cycle, the
aliquots were kept frozen at ≤ -20 °C for a minimum of 24 hours prior to testing. Each frozen
aliquot was rapidly thawed at 37°C for ≤ 10 minutes for retesting in triplicate with the assay.
The freezing, thawing, and testing steps were repeated for a second freeze/thaw cycle. The

results suggest that there is no statistically significant difference between the results of fresh
plasma samples and plasma samples frozen and thawed once or twice prior to being tested on
the ACL TOP 970 CL with HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM and HemosIL CL Anti-ß2
Glycoprotein-I IgM assays.
Reagent Stability:
Shelf-Life Stability
A shelf-life stability study was performed to establish the real-time stability claim of 2–8℃
for HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM reagent cartridge. Six lots of reagent cartridges were
stored at 2–8℃ and tested in triplicate using a panel of four citrated plasma sample pools
and two control levels (low and high) at the following time intervals baseline, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10,
11, 12, and 13 months. Individual test results were compared to the baseline mean. All
results were within the established acceptance criteria. The HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin
IgM reagent cartridge has a shelf-life claim of 12 months when stored at 2–8℃.
A shelf-life stability study was performed to establish the real-time stability claim of 2–8℃
for HemosIL CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM reagent cartridge. Three lots of reagent
cartridges were stored at 2–8℃ and tested in triplicate using a panel of four citrated plasma
sample pools and two control levels (low and high) at the following time intervals baseline,
2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, and 11 months. Individual test results were compared to the baseline mean.
All results were within the established acceptance criteria. The HemosIL CL Anti-ß2
Glycoprotein-I IgM reagent cartridge has a shelf-life of 10 months when stored at 2–8℃.
On-Board Stability
An on-board stability study was performed to establish the continuous on-board instrument
stability claim for HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM and HemosIL CL Anti-ß2
Glycoprotein-I IgM reagent cartridges on the ACL TOP 970 CL at 2–8℃. Three lots of each
reagent cartridge were placed on-board the ACL TOP 970 CL and tested in triplicate using a
panel of four citrated plasma sample pools and two control levels at the following time
intervals baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 weeks. The baseline means were established with 12
replicates of each plasma and control samples. Results were compared to the baseline means
and all results were within the acceptance criteria and support an on-board stability claim of
six weeks at 2–8℃.
Shipping Stability
A transport simulation study was performed to assess the shipping stability of the HemosIL
CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM and HemosIL CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM reagent cartridges
during transport. The testing was performed with three lots of each reagent cartridge. The
transport simulation test was assessed by comparing the performance of reagent cartridges
boxed as final kits and packaged into two packs for regular shipment and held at two
different temperatures:
• Stressed Pack 1: 4 days at room temperature (15–30°C) followed by one day at -
20°C followed by 2–8°C storage until testing
• Stressed Pack 2: 2 days at room temperature (15–30°C), three days at 37°C
followed by 2–8°C storage until testing
Testing was performed within seven days after respective stress termination of each pack
compared to the baseline (cartridges stored continuously at 2–8°C). Reagent cartridges were
K221359 - Page 12 of 16

--- Page 13 ---
analyzed with a panel of four citrated plasma sample pools and two control levels (low and
high), with each material run in triplicate. Results obtained in the transport simulation study
were within acceptance criteria and supports that the product packaging mitigates the
potential impact of temperature stressing during transport.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) studies
were performed according to CLSI EP17-A2 by using three different lots of each HemosIL
CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM and HemosIL CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM tested on an ACL
TOP 970 CL.
The LoB was determined by the measuring five analyte-free plasma samples tested in five
replicates over three days in a single run per day for each of three lots (75 observations per
lot). The LoB was calculated as the 95th percentile using the non-parametric method for each
lot as the dataset showed non-normal distribution. The claimed LoB was the highest 95th
percentile value across the three lots.
The LoD was determined by measuring five low level plasma samples tested in replicates of
five over three days in a single run per day for each of three lots (75 observations per lot).
LoD was calculated as the LoB + 1.652 x SD of the replicates for the samples and the highest
LoD across the three lots was the LoD claim.
The LoQ was determined by measuring five low level plasma samples tested in replicates of
six over three days in two runs per day for each of three lots (60 replicates per sample per
lot). The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration of measurand that meets within-
laboratory imprecision goal of <20% for each lot.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay cut-offs were determined to be 20 U/mL in a clinical cut-off study below.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
See Section F.
9. Carry-Over:
Sample carryover testing for HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM and HemosIL CL Anti-β
2
Glycoprotein-I IgM was performed on two ACL TOP 970 CL instruments. Carryover was
determined by a two-step process. The first step was the determination of the expected
baseline results for the low/recipient sample. The second step consisted of multiple runs
which included the low recipient and high donor sample. The sample carryover was an
average overall carryover of -0.35 U/mL for HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM and 0.93
U/mL for HemosIL CL Anti-β Glycoprotein I IgM.

The study to assess the effect of different concentrations of sodium citrate (3.2% or 3.8%)
found within the commercially available sample collection tubes on the performance of the
HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM and HemosIL CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM on the
ACL TOP 970 CL.
Paired plasma samples were collected in 3.2% and 3.8% sodium citrate anticoagulant
collection devices from adults ≥ 22 years of age who were diagnosed with APS or some other
non-APS condition and tested on the ACL TOP 970 CL.
The study results suggest there is no difference in performance between 3.2% or 3.8%
citrated plasma samples with HemosIL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM and HemosIL CL Anti-ß2
Glycoprotein-I IgM on the ACL TOP 970 CL.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
A cohort of clinical samples evaluated the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the HemosIL
CL Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM assay. The study included APS samples from the patients
diagnosed with APS and non-APS samples from patients diagnosed with a variety of clinical
conditions. The samples were enrolled and tested at three clinical sites or were acquired and
tested at an internal laboratory. Investigators at each clinical site enrolled subjects according
to pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria. The diagnosis of APS was based on the 2006
classification criteria1 for APS, while non-APS samples were enrolled based on a suspicion
of APS or having related diseases, including autoimmune diseases, thrombotic disorders,
infectious diseases, pre-eclampsia. Data from each site was compiled and the clinical
sensitivity and specificity for HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM assay and the HemosIL CL
Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM assay in diagnosis of APS and non-APS were analyzed and
results are shown in the following tables:

D Clinical Cut-Off:
The 20.0 U/mL clinical cut-off for the assays was previously determined, in K092181 for the
HemosIL AcuStar Anti-Cardiolipin IgM assay and in K091556 for the HemosIL AcuStar Anti-
ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM assay.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A negative test result is expected in both assays for apparently healthy individuals. To determine
the expected values, 100 normal donors (60 females and 40 males) were tested in singlicate on
an ACL TOP 970 CL instrument following CLSI EP28-A3c. All results from the normal donors
were below the cut-off of 20.0 U/mL. For the HemosIL CL Anti-Cardiolipin IgM assay, the
range of samples was 0.0–7.7 U/mL and for the HemosIL AcuStar Anti-ß2 Glycoprotein-I IgM
assay the range of sample concentrations was 0.0–2.6 U/mL.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
