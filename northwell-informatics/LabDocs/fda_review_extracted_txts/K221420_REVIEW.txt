III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk Service uses qualitative genotyping to detect
clinically relevant genetic variants associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) in
genomic DNA isolated from human saliva collected from individuals ≥ 18 years with
ORAcollect·Dx OCD-100.014 for the purpose of reporting and interpreting Genetic Health Risks
(GHR).
This Service is indicated for reporting 14 genetic variants in the SERPINA1 gene: PI*S; PI*Z;

bellingham; PI*F; PI*P lowell; PI*Q0 mattawa; PI*Q0 clayton, and PI*M heerlen. The report
describes if a person is at an increased or decreased risk of developing either lung and/or liver
disease linked to AATD. The report does not describe a person´s overall risk of developing lung
and/or liver disease. AATD is more common in persons of European descent.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
• For over-the-counter (OTC) use.
• The test is intended for users ≥18 years old.
• The test is not a substitute for an appointment with a healthcare professional. It is
recommended that the user consults with a healthcare professional if the user has any questions
or concerns about his/her results.
• The test does not diagnose a disease or condition, determine medical treatment or other medical
intervention, or tell the user anything about their current state of health. Only a healthcare
professional can diagnose a disease or condition.
• Any diagnostic or treatment decisions must be based on confirmatory prescription testing
and/or other information that a healthcare professional determines to be appropriate for the
patient, such as additional clinical testing and other risk factors that may affect individual risk
and health care.
• The test detects 14 variants in the SERPINA1 gene linked to AATD. These 14 variants explain
95% of AATD cases. The absence of a variant tested does not rule out the presence of other
genetic variants that may be disease-related.
• The test does not describe a person's overall risk of developing AATD. In addition, other
genetic and all non-genetic factors should be considered
• The laboratory may be unable to process every user’s sample. The probability that the
laboratory cannot process a sample can be up to 0.5%. If this happens, the user will receive an
K221420 - Page 2 of 64

--- Page 3 ---
email notification. The user will also receive another AlphaID At Home Saliva Collection Kit
to provide a new sample to the laboratory.
• The user´s race, ethnicity, age, and sex may affect how the genetic results are interpreted.
• Subject to meeting limitations contained in the special controls under the regulation 21 CFR
866.5950.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk Service is to be performed using 384-well Veriti Dx
and 96-well Veriti Dx thermal cyclers, and the Luminex 200 instrument.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk Service uses qualitative genotyping to detect
clinically relevant genetic variants associated with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) in
genomic DNA isolated from human saliva and provides a report describing if a person is at risk
of developing either lung and/or liver disease linked to AATD. This Service is direct-to-
consumer and intended for an over-the-counter (OTC) use.
The AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk Service is composed of:
(i) ORAcollect·Dx OCD-100.014 (cleared under K212745) is intended for use in the non-
invasive collection of saliva samples.
(ii) A1AT Genotyping Test (cleared under K192858) is intended for the genetic analysis and
detection of genetic variants associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) using
the A1AT Genotyping Test ANALYSIS SOFTWARE, and
(iii) AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk Service website and result portal software are
intended to provide the contents and the procedure to order and use the OTC Service.
A consumer’s saliva is self-collected using ORAcollect·Dx OCD-100.014 manufactured by
DNA Genotek, Inc which consists of a collection tube containing a stabilizing buffer solution.
Once the sample is collected, it is shipped to a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
(CLIA)-certified laboratory for processing.
Human DNA from the saliva sample is isolated, processed and analyzed with the A1AT
Genotyping Test that is indicated for reporting 14 genetic variants in the SERPINA1 gene: PI*S;
PI*Z; PI*I; PI*M procida; PI*M malton; PI*S iiyama; PI*Q0 granite falls; PI*Q0 west; PI*Q0
bellingham; PI*F; PI*P lowell; PI*Q0 mattawa; PI*Q0 clayton, and PI*M heerlen. Briefly,
genomic DNA extracted from human saliva is amplified and biotinylated by multiplex
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the resulting labeled PCR products are denatured and
hybridized to allele-specific oligonucleotide probes coupled to color-coded microspheres.
Hybridized DNA is labeled with a fluorescent conjugate and the resulting signal is detected with
a Luminex 200 system. Raw fluorescence data is processed with the A1AT Genotyping Test
ANALYSIS SOFTWARE to provide allelic variant genotypes, which are subsequently
converted into associated alleles. Additionally, the software application also provides the type of
K221420 - Page 3 of 64

--- Page 4 ---
Genetic Health Risk Report associated with the identified alleles, which is subsequently used as
the basis for the generation of personalized reports by the AlphaID At Home Genetic Health
Risk Service website and result portal.
Depending on the specific variant combination detected, the AlphaID At Home Genetic Health
Risk Service provides the individuals’ genetic health risk for developing lung and liver disease
linked to AATD. Personalized reports, in an easy-to-understand format, are generated for each
consumer that help to understand the meaning of their results and any appropriate actions that
may be taken based on their results. In addition, every user before receiving report must undergo
the educational module that helps to understand the AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk
Service results report and explain how genetics can impact a person’s health risk for lung disease
and/or liver disease linked to AATD. The AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk Service uses
four (4) categories summarized in the table below to define risk. One of these risk categories has
been assigned to each genetic result based on the information gathered from reported clinical
cases for each genetic result. If any of the 14 variants tested by this Service is detected, one of
the following four risk categories will be reported:
Risk Categories
Above 80% of people with this genetic result develop lung or
Increased risk
liver disease during their lifetime.
20-80% of people with this genetic result develop lung or
Slightly increased risk
liver disease during their lifetime.
Below 20% of people with this genetic result develop lung or
Not likely at increased risk
liver disease during their lifetime.
More clinical studies are needed to determine the risk level
Unknown risk
associated with this genetic result
When no variants are detected, the report shows ‘Not Likely at Risk’ for AATD. When the
service is not able to provide a genetic result, the associated lung and liver disease risk categories
cannot be determined, and another type of report will be generated: ‘Variant not determined’.
Based on the number of variants detected (0, 1, 2, or variant not determined) and specific lung
and liver disease risk categorization reported, a total of 15 types of reports can be generated by
the AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk Service, which are shown in the table below:

B Principle of Operation:
The AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk Service is performed by a CLIA-certified laboratory
using the Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) Genotyping Test.
The A1AT Genotyping Test utilizes Luminex xMAP technology. Genomic DNA is extracted
from human saliva samples collected as buccal swabs using ORAcollect·Dx OCD-100.014.
Extracted DNA is amplified and biotinylated by multiplex PCR and the PCR products are
denatured and hybridized to oligonucleotide probes coupled to color-coded beads. Hybridized
DNA is labeled with fluorescent conjugate and the resulting signal is detected with a Luminex
200 system (with xPONENT software). Raw data obtained is processed with the A1AT
Genotyping Test Analysis Software.
The A1AT Genotyping Test Analysis Software algorithm converts the allelic variant genotypes
into associated alleles. Additionally, this software application also provides an associated
template number for each sample, this is, a code that defines the type of Genetic Health Risk
Report that is to be generated for each individual, depending on its combination of variants. This
template number will be subsequently used as the basis for the generation of personalized reports
by the AlphaID System.

A Analytical Performance:
All results presented below met the sponsor’s pre-defined acceptance criteria outlined in the
Special Controls of 21 CFR 866.5950. Information regarding samples that failed quality control
(FQC) was also evaluated and presented in each study below.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Refer to K171868 for results of the reproducibility study that was conducted with a total of
17 samples. The reproducibility of the assay was evaluated at three sites, with two operators
at each site performing one run per day across three non-consecutive days (three runs per
operator or six runs per site). Within a given run, the sample panel was tested in duplicate.
Concordance with the expected results was 100% at the three sites.
Refer to K192858 for DNA extraction variability in saliva samples that was conducted using
three different extraction methods: QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen), Commercial
lysis and neutralization solutions (Sigma) and QIAsymphony DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen).
Refer to K171868 and K211115 for results of the lot-to-lot imprecision study.

total of 227 samples representing all genetic variants interrogated by the assay were analyzed
and compared with bi-directional Sanger sequencing (reference method).
The percent agreements (PAs) per allelic variant from clinical samples and contrived samples
(8 synthetic DNAs samples) were calculated separately. The PA per allelic variant between
the two methods was 100% for both clinical samples and contrived samples. The percentage
of “No call’ or “Invalid test” per allelic variant was also calculated and was 0% for both
clinical samples and contrived samples.
The PAs of AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk Service genotype results with comparator

a) Risk of developing lung and liver disease associated with AATD depends on specific
variant combination detected
AATD is a genetic autosomal recessive disease with codominant expression (i.e., each of
the two alleles present in each person contributes 50% on the total generated AAT
protein), characterized by low levels of the AAT protein in the blood, that may lead to
various health conditions. The most common diseases are lung and/or liver disease.
AATD occurs in people of all ethnicities worldwide.1 However, it is most common in
people of European descent. AATD affects about 1 in 1,500 to 3,500 people of European
descent.2,3 Many individuals with AATD are likely undiagnosed, particularly people with
a lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD can be
caused by AATD; however, AATD is rarely diagnosed. Some people with AATD are
misdiagnosed with asthma.4 Two to three percent of patients with COPD in the United
States are estimated to have AATD.2 The percentage of patients with liver disease who
have AATD is not known.
AATD is caused by modifications in the genetic sequence of the SERPINA1 gene, which
give rise to different variants. More than 120 variants in the SERPINA1 gene have been
identified. Some of these variants do not affect the production of AAT protein, but some
others may differently affect the levels or functionality of the AAT protein and, therefore,
each specific variant may be associated with different probabilities for the development
of lung disease and/or liver disease.

14 variants in the SERPINA1 gene associated with AATD. These 14 variants explain
95% of AATD cases1 and are mainly found in European population, except for PI*S
iiyama, which was described in the Asian population.5 The most common variants are
PI*S and PI*Z. Published studies estimate frequency ranges of 5−10% and 1−3% for
PI*S and PI*Z, respectively, in the European population.3 An analysis of the prevalence
of PI*S and PI*Z amongst the five major ethnic subgroups in the United States has
demonstrated that the highest risk for AATD is found in Caucasians, followed by
Hispanics and Blacks, with the lowest prevalence amongst Mexican Americans and no
risk amongst Asian.3 The remaining 12 genetic variants tested are reported with a very
low frequency in the population.3
Considering that a given person can have a genetic result of zero, one or two copies of the
variants detected, a total of 120 possible genotype combinations of these 14 variants can
be reported by the AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk Service:
• 1 genetic result with 0 variants detected (wild-type homozygous),
• 14 genetic results with 1 variant detected (heterozygous), and
• 105 genetic results with 2 variants detected (rare homozygous or compound heterozygous).
In some rare circumstances, a “variant not determined” result could be reported, which
means that the Service cannot determine if the user has any of the 14 tested variants in
the SERPINA1 gene linked to AATD. This is an inconclusive genetic result. The
presence of any other rare genetic variant in the DNA sequence can interfere with the
genetic analysis, leading to the inability to determine the genetic result. In this case, the
risk of developing lung and liver disease cannot be determined, and a different
test/Service is recommended to the user (DNA sequencing of the SERPINA1 gene).
Depending on the specific variant combination detected, the AlphaID At Home Genetic
Health Risk Service provides the individuals’ genetic health risk for developing lung
and/or liver disease linked to AATD. These variants can cause mild, severe, or very
severe plasma deficiency and can cause no accumulation or mild or severe accumulation
of protein in the liver. Normal AAT levels (80−120%) are defined by serum AAT levels
above 20 μmol/L (measured by nephelometry).3 It is considered that severe AATD is
defined by serum AAT levels below the lung protective threshold of 35% of the mean
expected value (50 mg/dl or 11 μmol/L measured by nephelometry, or 80 mg/dL
measured by radial immunodiffusion).2,3 Very severe AATD is defined by no active AAT
or AAT levels below 1%. AAT levels for the most frequent and most studies studied
genetic results are reported in Stoller et al. 20171 and provided in the table below.

The risk categorization is based on the reported clinical cases (published references) for
each genetic result. If any of the 14 variants tested is detected, one of the four following
risk categories will be reported:
1) Increased risk: There is an increased risk of developing lung or liver disease linked to
AATD compared to the general population. The chance of developing lung or liver
disease linked to AATD is higher than that of the general population. Above 80% of
people with this genetic result develop lung or liver disease during their lifetime.
2) Slightly at Increased risk: There is a slightly increased risk of developing lung or
liver disease linked to AATD compared to the general population. The chance of
developing lung or liver disease linked to AATD is slightly higher than that of the
general population. 20−80% of people with this genetic result develop lung or liver
disease during their lifetime.
3) Not likely at increased risk: There is average risk of developing lung or liver disease
linked to AATD compared to the general population. The chance of developing lung
or liver disease linked to AATD is similar to that of the general population. Below
20% of people with this genetic result develop lung or liver disease during their
lifetime.
4) Unknown risk: The risk of developing lung or liver disease linked to AATD is not
known due to the lack of reported clinical cases or inconclusive data. The chance of
developing lung or liver disease linked to AATD is unknown. More clinical studies
are needed to determine the risk level.

When No Variants are detected by this Service, the result will show ‘Not Likely at Risk
for AATD’. It cannot rule out the possibility of having an extremely rare variant linked to
AATD not tested by this Service. It is still possible to have a higher risk category of
developing lung and/or liver disease linked to AATD.
These reported risk categories are based on the evidence in the scientific literature and are
summarized below separately for lung disease and liver disease:
a. Lung disease risk categorization
The AAT protein is made in the liver, released into the bloodstream, and enters the
lungs, where it inactivates neutrophil elastase, thereby protecting the lung tissue from
protease mediated damage. As such, the plasma levels of this protein have widely
been described to be directly related to the amount that is reaching the lungs, and
consequently, with its lung protection capability. 2% to 3% of patients with COPD in
the United States are estimated to have AATD.2 Symptomatic obstructive lung
disease in AATD usually presents in patients in their 30s and 40s. Considerable
variability in the time of onset of symptoms has been described. Although severe
symptoms are most often seen in current or previous cigarette smokers, some smokers
and many nonsmokers develop no symptoms at all.2,3,6,7
The classic pulmonary presentation of AATD is a severe, early onset panacinar
emphysema with a basilar predominance in adults. However, emphysema may also
occur in a diffuse distribution or predominantly in the upper lobes.2,3,6,7 In addition to
emphysema, AATD is also characterized by chronic, progressive fatigue and other
nonspecific respiratory symptoms.3 Shortness of breath, medically known as dyspnea,
is generally the prominent symptom, but chronic cough or wheezing may also occur,
as early as age 18 years.2,6 Pulmonary function testing show findings consistent with
COPD; however, bronchodilator responsiveness may be seen and may be labelled as
asthma.7 The presence of episodic wheezing and dyspnea consistent with a diagnosis
of asthma has been noted in AATD.2 Recurring lung infections are also shown in
subjects with AATD.2 Bronchiectasis, with or without concomitant emphysema, is
less common.6,7 Although it is likely that AATD can promote the development of
bronchial asthma and bronchiectasis, there is no reliable evidence as to whether
AATD influences the frequency or gravity of these diseases.3
The reported lung disease risk category has been determined based on the clinical
outcome which includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema,
chronic bronchitis, and bronchiectasis of the reported cases for each genetic result.
The following general criteria summarized in the table below has been followed for
the assignment of a risk category for each genetic result. The “Unknown risk”
category is assigned to genotypes with <3 reported clinical cases, as well those with
≥3 reported clinical cases but with a calculated risk confidence interval overlapping
with the other two risk categories.

NOTE: Exceptions to this general classification are:
• All carriers with at least one PI*M allele (except PI*M/PI*Z ever-smokers) will be reported as ‘Not
likely at increased risk’
• PI*Z/PI*Null and PI*Null/PI*Null combinations will be assigned as ‘Increased risk’. Null variants:
PI*Q0 granite falls, PI*Q0 west, PI*Q0 bellingham, PI*Q0 mattawa and PI*Q0 clayton
* The reported risk category may be updated if there is enough data to provide confidence intervals that do
not overlap between two consecutive risk categories
The lung disease risk categorization along with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the
risk estimates for the 119 genetic results with one or two variants detected are presented
in the table below based on the number of reported clinical cases extracted from the
referenced scientific literature and meta-analyses that analyze clinical cases with and
without lung disease. Pending new clinical cases being published, the risk category is to
be updated if there is enough data to provide confidence intervals that do not overlap
between two consecutive risk categories. Since the intended population of the Service is
≥18 years of age, only cases (≥18 years old) have been included in the analysis to
estimate the risk, when the age date was described in the study. The exceptions to the
general criteria for liver disease risk categorization are shaded in grey in the table below.

Among the most frequent genetic combinations, the PI*M/PI*S and PI*S/PI*S genetic

Individuals (especially never-smokers) with PI*M/PI*Z are not considered to be at
risk for lung disease.1 However, a subset of individuals with the PI*M/PI*Z genotype
may experience accelerated lung destruction, especially if they are smokers.2,8
Smokers with this genetic result have a slightly increased risk of developing lung
disease linked to AATD. PI*M/PI*Z heterozygotes have a clear predisposition to
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), at least among smokers.8 All the

AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk Service reports describe smoking as a non-
genetic risk factor that can increase the risk of developing lung disease. Except for the
PI*M PI*/Z genotype, a differential classification for ever-smokers (Slightly at
increased risk) and non-smokers (Not likely at increased risk) has not been possible
for other genotypes because information about the smoking history of every specific
subject included in the studies was not available.
There is a 20% of individuals with PI*S/PI*Z with AAT levels below the lung
protective threshold (<11 μM/L), who are at risk for AATD related lung diseases.1
Studies demonstrated that the odds ratio for COPD in individuals with this genetic
result, compared with normal PI*M/PI*M individuals, was significantly increased at
3.3 (95% CI: 1.2–8.6 %), showing that the PI*S/PI*Z genotype is a significant risk
factor for COPD.9 Although individuals with this genetic result who do not smoke are
considered at slightly at increased risk of developing lung disease, existing scientific
evidence confirms that the effect of smoking in this specific variant combination is
profound and will produce reduction in pulmonary function. It is generally accepted
that individuals with PI*S/PI*Z and serum AAT levels below the protective threshold
value, have an increased risk of developing lung disease, especially if they smoke.10
However, available data from ever-smokers indicate that smokers with PI*S/PI*Z
may be also assigned to the ‘Slightly at increased risk’ category, the same as the
general risk category assigned for this genotype. Hutchinson et al., 1983 described
that eight PI*S/PI*Z index cases smokers developed emphysema out of the 12 total
index cases smokers (66.7% with 95%CI: 43.1−84.1%).10 Thus, even considering
only smoker and index cases, there is no evidence supporting an “Increased risk”
classification (>80% reported cases with lung disease) for this subgroup of PI*S/PI*Z
individuals.
The PI*Z variant in homozygosis is associated with an increased risk of lung
disease.2,3 Greater than 80% of people with this genetic result develop lung disease
during their lifetime.1
Exceptions to the criteria for lung disease risk categorization are applied to the
following genetic results:
(i) carriers with at least one PI*M (normal) allele due to the limited information
available up to date. Based on the clinical data from the carriers of the most
common variants, as well as on the expected protein levels above the protective
threshold for the subjects presenting at least one PI*M allele, it is more adequate
to report all the carriers except for ever-smokers PI*M/PI*Z as “Not likely at
increased risk” (refer to #88−99 in the ‘Lung Disease Risk Categorization’ table).
Consistent with this risk categorization, for individuals who possess only one
deficiency allele, the risk of developing any clinically significant symptoms is

either slight or negligible.11 Data from carriers with enough clinical cases (refer to
#88−94) also support this “Not likely at increased risk” classification.
(ii) carriers with the PI*Z/PI*Null and PI*Null/PI*Null combinations that cause
severe and very severe plasma deficiency, respectively. The AAT protein levels
for the PI*Z/PI*Null and PI*Null/PI*Null individuals are expected to be below
the protective threshold. Both the PI*Z/PI*Null and PI*Null/PI*Null
combinations are assigned as “Increased risk”. Data from combinations with
enough clinical cases also support this “Increased risk” classification because
100% individuals with these genetic results develop lung disease, although the
number of cases is not high enough (refer to #100−103 in the ‘Lung Disease Risk
Categorization’ table).
b. Liver disease risk categorization
In addition to pulmonary complications, AATD is also a risk factor for other serious
illnesses, most commonly for liver disease. Liver disease associated with AATD is
mainly caused by an impaired process of releasing the AAT protein into the
bloodstream, which gives rise to its accumulation in the liver. The accumulation of
inclusions of the mutant AAT protein triggers cycles of hepatocyte injury, cell death
and compensatory proliferation.2,3
The severity of the disease correlates with the magnitude of accumulation of the
mutant AAT protein. It is known that the prevalence of chronic liver disease in
AATD increases with age and that chronic liver disease may be asymptomatic for
years. Liver disease linked to AATD may present clinically in a variety of ways: liver
enzyme elevations, jaundice, hepatic fibrosis, chronic hepatitis, liver failure or liver
cirrhosis, and in a low percentage of subject’s hepatocellular carcinoma.2,3
The PI*Z, PI*M malton and PI*S iiyama variants (i.e., severe accumulation alleles)
cause severe accumulation of the mutant AAT protein in the liver whereas the PI*M
procida, PI*Q0 granite falls, PI*Q0 west, PI*Q0 bellingham, PI*F, PI*P lowell,
PI*Q0 mattawa, PI*Q0 clayton, and PI*M Heerlen variants (i.e., non-accumulation
variants) are not associated with the accumulation of the mutant AAT protein in the
liver. The mild accumulation alleles are PI*I and PI*S.
The PI*Z allele encodes an AAT protein that is able to bind to other AAT proteins,
leading to AAT polymers formation, which form inclusion bodies inside the liver and
are not secreted into the circulation.2,3 Clinical studies with these affected individuals
have consistently associated this variant with a slightly increased risk of developing
liver disease.2,3 Similarly, the PI*M malton variant is known to be significantly
associated with hepatic disease due to intracellular accumulation of the mutant AAT
protein.13 PI*M malton homozygous individuals have also shown a tendency to form

polymeric intrahepatic inclusions12 and available scientific data confirm association
with liver disease in these individuals.2,3
The liver disease risk category reported by the AlphaID At Home Genetic Health
Risk Service was determined based on the probability of each tested variant to be
accumulated in the liver and clinical outcome of the reported cases for each genetic
result. The following general criteria summarized in the table were followed for the
assignment of a liver disease risk category for each genetic result. Pending new
clinical cases being published, the risk category may be updated if there is enough
data to provide confidence intervals that do not overlap between two consecutive risk
categories.

NOTE: Exceptions to this general liver disease risk classification are:
• Individuals with at least one PI*Z or PI*M malton severe accumulation allele and their
combinations will be reported as “Slightly Increased risk”
• All the combinations including two non-accumulation alleles will be reported as “Not likely at
Increased risk”. Non-accumulation alleles: PI*M, PI*M procida, PI*Q0 granite falls, PI*Q0 west,
PI*Q0 bellingham, PI*F, PI*P lowell, PI*Q0 mattawa, PI*Q0 clayton, and PI*M heerlen
* The reported risk category may be updated if there is enough published data to provide confidence

The liver disease risk categorization for the 119 genetic results with one or two
variants detected is presented in the table below along with the 95% CIs of the risk
estimates based on the number of reported clinical cases with and without liver
disease in the referenced scientific literature. Considering that the intended population
is ≥18 years old and the phenotype of the liver disease in adults is different from that
in children, all pediatric cases (<18 years old) have been removed from the analysis
performed to estimate the risk of liver disease when the patient age was included in
the study.

1 The percentage (%) and 95% confidence interval (CI95%) of the reported clinical cases have been calculated
following the score method described by Altman et al., 2000.
2 The different combinations of the PI*S and PI*Z alleles (PI*M/PI*S, PI*M/PI*Z, PI*S/PI*Z, PI*S/PI*S and PI*
Z/PI*Z) cover more than 95% of variant alleles identified in the SERPINA1 gene worldwide.
3 Non-accumulation variants: PI*M, PI*M procida, PI*F, PI*P lowell, PI*M heerlen, PI*Q0 granite falls, PI*Q0
west, PI*Q0 bellingham, PI*Q0 mattawa, and PI*Q0 clayton.
4 Mild accumulation variants: PI*I and PI*S.
5 Severe accumulation variants: PI*S iiyama, PI*M malton, and PI*Z.
Exceptions to this general liver disease risk classification are shaded in grey in the
table above and are applied to the following genetic results:
i) Any combinations of a non-accumulation allele:
It is well-established that PI*M procida, PI*Q0 granite falls, PI*Q0 west, PI*Q0
bellingham, PI*F, PI*P lowell, PI*Q0 mattawa, PI*Q0 clayton, and PI*M heerlen
variants do not cause AAT protein accumulation in the liver. Therefore, all the
combinations including two non-accumulation alleles (refer to #6 to 59 in the
‘Liver Disease Risk Categorization’ table) will be reported with as ‘Not likely at
increased risk’ result for liver disease.
ii) Any combination with the severe accumulation alleles PI*Z and PI*M malton:
Due to the high amount of scientific evidence showing the severe accumulation of
the mutant AAT protein in the liver triggered by the PI*Z and PI*M malton
variants, as well as on the clinical data obtained from the high number of (i)
homozygous individuals (i.e., PI*Z/PI*Z and PI*M malton/PI*M malton; refer to
#5 and #95 in the ‘Liver Disease Risk Categorization’ table) and (ii) carrier
individuals of these two variants that have been studied (PI*M/PI*Z and
PI*M/PI*M malton; refer to #2 and #94 in the same table), there is enough
scientific evidence supporting the classification of the compound heterozygous
(PI*Z/PI*M malton) and the genetic results with at least one severe accumulation
allele, PI*Z or PI*M malton (refer to #96−#119 in the same table), to the ‘Slightly
at Increased risk’ category even though the available clinical data up to date does

not show the same calculated risk e.g., ‘Unknown risk’ for PI*Z/PI*I with 50%
reported clinical cases of lung disease and 95% CI: 18.2%−81.8% (refer to #111)
and ‘Not likely at increased risk’ for PI*Z/PI*F with 25% reported clinical cases
of lung disease and 95% CI: 8.7−54% (refer to #114).
Although the PI*S iiyama variant has also been widely described as a severe
accumulation variant, different combinations of this variant are reported as ‘Unknown
risk’ (following the general criteria), since no enough clinical data have been
published for its combinations except for PI*Z/PI*S iiyama compound heterozygous
(refer to #112 in the ‘Liver Disease Risk Categorization’ table), which is reported as
‘Slightly at increased risk’ based on the established evidence of the PI*Z variant.
The risk classification of lung disease and liver disease for each of the 121 possible genetic
results of the AlphaID At Home Genetic Health Risk Service including ‘Variants not
Determined’ is summarized in the table below. The most frequent genetic results are shaded in

i. User Comprehension Study
a. Saliva collection kit user study:
Refer to K212745 for the saliva collection device (ORAcollect®·Dx OCD-100.014)
instructions for use and to assess the ability of lay users to provide samples adequate
for testing.
b. AlphaID At Home GHR Service user comprehension study:
Objectives:
The user comprehension study for the AlphaID At Home GHR Service was
conducted in a demographically diverse U.S. population of naïve users (e.g., age,
gender, ethnicity, and education level) to assess comprehension of the GHR reports
through a survey that covers the six comprehension domains (purpose of the test,
other risk factors, limitations of the test, relevance of ethnicity, results of the test, and
appropriate next steps) in a controlled online setting.
Study Methods:
The study was implemented as described below:
Step 1: Quota-based sampling per U.S. Census was employed to recruit a diverse set
of study participants from urban and rural settings across a wide geography based on
their demographic variables in age, gender, ethnicity, and education level. Each of the
four U.S. Census geographic regions are adequately represented by participants:
Northeast, Midwest, South and West.
Step 2: Study participants were asked to review and confirm their agreement to an
informed consent form.
Step 3: Eligible study participants who had consented were passed to a Pre-Interview
web-based survey which was self-administered and took approximately 10 minutes to
complete a Pre-Test user comprehension questionnaire. At this stage, participants
were randomly assigned into study arms which determined which type of report
participants received.

The substantive exclusion criteria and operational exclusion criteria listed in the table
below were applied at each step when necessary and detailed reasons were
documented.
Substantive Exclusion Criteria (criteria identified about potential users' background)
1 Indicated that they are not naive to the test subject of the study, in that they:
• Have had direct to consumer genetic testing themselves
• Have had research or healthcare-based genetic testing themselves (including
• genetic testing for AATD)
• Have a personal diagnosis of AATD
• Have significant medical and/or genetic education
• Have had experience working:
as a healthcare provider where, genetic testing could have been involved (i.e., as a nurse,
o
physician, physician's assistant, or genetic counselor)
in the field of human genetics.
o
• Have been a customer, employee, or study participant of Progenika, Grifols, or SoundRocket
2 Indicated they would never be interested in using a direct-to-consumer genetic test
Operational Exclusion Criteria (criteria identified before or during study implementation)
• Failure to consent to participate.
• Failure to follow study instructions
• Failure to review GHR test report
• Failure to complete the PRE survey (including scheduling Live Televideo Interview)
• Failure to complete the Live Televideo Interview (LTI) which includes the POST survey
within a 60-minute session
• Failure to commit to, schedule, or show up for a one-time effort to participate in the LTI
• Failure to follow verbal and/or written instructions during the study protocol
• Communicated that they will not take, are not taking, or did not take the study tasks
seriously
• Failure of facilities (i.e., technological issue, power outage, Internet down for moderator or
participant, etc.)
• Lacking abilities (self-reported or observed by moderator):
to read the report (i.e., forgot glasses, are legally blind, etc.)
o
to use a computer to complete the basic tasks of viewing a browser window, navigating a
o
mouse to click survey responses, etc.
• Demonstrated or described cognitive impairment, either self-reported or observed by
• moderator and corroborated with score on the Six-Item Cognitive Impairment Test (6CIT)
• Other failures not related to comprehension
An individual was considered a refusal if they did not consent or withdrew consent to participate in
the study.
Step 4: Study participants who completed the last step were invited to participate in a
live televideo interview (LTI). The LTI was administered via a video conferencing
platform at a time scheduled individually between the participant and a study

moderator. The interview was scheduled for no more than 60 minutes total. Each
participant was required to review the Education Module for approximately 5−10
minutes).and then the GHR Service Report (Your Result section) for approximately
15−20 minutes. Each participant was informed regarding accessibility to
Supplemental Materials consisting of the “Table of Risk Categories”, “Table of
Variants”, “Package Insert”, and “References”.
User comprehension was tested through a two-step process. First, participants’
comprehension was tested prior to viewing the Educational Module and GHR
Reports. The Pre-Test questionnaire included basic demographics (for inclusion/
exclusion criteria) and baseline comprehension questions that covered the following
comprehension domains: test purpose [PURPOSE], test limitations [LIMITATIONS],
race/ethnicity [ETHNICITY], and other factors that may have an impact on the test
results [OTHER FACTORS]. Second, on completion of reviewing a representative
sample of all the material that is included in these documents, participants were
provided with the Post-Test questionnaire to complete (approximately 20 minutes).
The Post-Test questionnaire included comprehension questions designed to measure
all six comprehension domains: test results [RESULTS] and appropriate action
[NEXT STEPS] in addition to PURPOSE, LIMITATIONS, ETHNICITY, OTHER
FACTORS. The RESULTS and NEXT STEPS domains were only included in the
Post-Test questionnaire because they represented specific results that participants
could not know prior to viewing the GHR reports and related materials. Each
comprehension domain included at least two comprehension questions.
Throughout the completion of the study tasks, the Moderator was able to help the
participant navigate between tabs or with technical difficulties as needed but did not
give any instructions or answer any questions about how to interpret the report or
answer questions. Both the participant's face and screen actions were recorded during
this interview. Time on-task (length of time to complete questionnaire) was also
recorded for each participant. Operational exclusion criteria were applied at this step
when necessary and detailed reasons were documented.
Of the 15 total possible GHR Reports that can be generated by the AlphaID At Home
GHR Service, five were selected for the User Comprehension Study. The selected
Reports summarized in the table below cover all the possibilities for number of
variants and risk categories associated with both lung disease and liver disease that
can be reported by the AlphaID At Home GHR Service:
• Number of variants detected in the SERPINA1 gene: a total of four different
reports can be obtained: 0, 1, or 2 variants detected, and ‘Variant not determined’.
• Risk category: four different risk categories (‘Not likely at increased risk’,
‘Slightly increased risk’, ‘Increased risk', and ‘Unknown risk) can be provided by
the test, which represent the risk for developing lung and /or liver disease.
Additionally, a ‘Not determined risk’ result can also be provided under certain
circumstances (Variant not determined).

* None of the genetic results currently provided by the Service yield an "increased risk" for liver

disease to be substantially differently in the context of the GHR report and, therefore, testing user
comprehension of the "increased risk" concept with lung disease would be sufficient to extrapolate
these results to the comprehension of the concept of "increased risk" of liver disease.
The study was set up to randomly assign each eligible study participant (refer to Step
3) to one of five study arms identified by the five pre-selected test report types, with
the following number of participants included per study arm as summarized in the
table below.

Each GHR Report includes the following sections: ‘Your Result’ (Result Report),
‘Scientific Details’, ‘Frequently Asked Questions’ (FAQs), and ‘Glossary of Terms’.
The GHR Reports and Supplemental Materials were reviewed by a Certified Genetic
Counselor (GC) to ensure that the materials sufficiently cover the relevant general
and variant-specific concepts [comprehension domains]. Prior to recruitment for the
user comprehension study, the test report materials (GHR Report, Education Module,
and Supplemental Materials) with content targeted no more difficult than 8th grade
reading level were evaluated for readability. The Educational Module and
Supplemental Materials generated to support the test result report were also evaluated
for readability. The Education Module, as well as all Results Reports, Scientific
Details, FAQs, and Glossary reached the 8th grade readability target. The
Supplemental Information section (which includes Table of Risk Categories, Table of
Variants, and Package Insert) achieved a 10th grade readability score overall which

was within the targeted readability maximum for the level of technical detail and

Of the 768 study participants engaged (consented) in this study, 57 were determined
to be ineligible during the Pre-Interview web-based survey administration. Of those
711 eligible participants in the study, 186 were ultimately excluded after the Pre-
Interview web-based survey for a variety of reasons. This includes 18 cases that failed
to complete the pre-survey in full. Of the 693 respondents who completed the pre-
survey and scheduled a live televideo interview (LTI), 133 either failed to show up or
cancelled their scheduled LTI. Of the 560 cases that were present at their scheduled
LTI, 35 cases were excluded due to operational exclusion criteria applied with
moderator judgment during the LTI. The most common operational exclusion
criterion applied (in 26 of these 35 cases) was "failed to complete LTI due to
inadequate technological capabilities”. The other reasons for exclusion include: (i)
lacking abilities to read the report (i.e., forgot glasses, are legally blind, etc.), (ii)
lacking abilities to use a computer or tablet to complete the basic tasks of viewing a
browser window, navigating a mouse to click survey responses, etc., (iii) failure to
follow verbal and/or written instructions during the study protocol, (iv) failure to
review test report; (v) failure to follow study instructions, and (vi) failure to complete
the live televideo interview (LTI) which includes the POST survey within a 60-
minute session, (vii) Failure of facilities outside of control of moderator or participant
(i.e., power outage, Internet down for moderator or participant, etc.).
Results:
Comprehension scores were calculated using the total number of responses received
that were correct over the total number of eligible responses received. The calculated
proportion for each domain serves as the comprehension score for that domain. The
target score for each comprehension domain was 90% across all reports. A mean
comprehension rate was calculated across all comprehension question domains and
all reports. To evaluate whether the comprehension scores had significantly improved
statistically, the pre- and post-test scores in each domain, and overall, were compared
by using paired sample t-test. Results summarized in the table below show that each
comprehension domain achieved a minimum of 90.1% or higher user comprehension
score in the pre-test questionnaire, and 94.0% or higher user comprehension score in
the post-test questionnaire, across all reports. The overall comprehension scores were
of 92.7% and 96.8% across all comprehension domains and reports, for the pre-test
and post-test questionnaire, respectively, exceeding the study goals of 90%
comprehension overall. Results of the pre- to post-test comparison by paired sample
t-tests showed a statistically significant improvement in the user comprehension
scores (p <0.0001) between the pre-and post-test questionnaire for the Education
Module, and the domains of ‘Purpose’, ‘Limitations’, and ‘Ethnicity’ as well as
overall (all report domains). Statistical significance demonstrates that the increase in
user comprehension score was a result of the labeling. The ‘Other Factors’ domain
which was the highest Pre-Test score of all the domains showed no significant
difference (p = 0.662) because the score remained effectively the same from pre-test
(98.0%) to post-test (97.7%). The results showed that the GHR reports had excellent
comprehension of the Service’s purpose, limitations, results, relevance of ethnicity,
other factors that may impact test results, and appropriate next steps.

In evaluating potential bias due to study participant nonresponse and exclusion based on
eligibility in the Pre-Interview web-based survey or based on exclusion criteria applied
after participants were in the study, the demographic make-up of the Completed (Total
Participants) group was not different from that of the Target Population suggesting that
the desired goal of reaching a diverse population of study participants that reflect the
diversity of the U.S. on gender, race/ethnicity, education, and age was met. Even though
‘Education’ showed the largest difference between the Target Population and the final set
of study participants, each education category (including high school or less) individually
scored well above the 90% comprehension threshold both overall and on each domain.
No significant differences between the categories of the Study Engaged (consented)

participants did not impact user comprehension in this study as both males and females
scored well above the 90% user comprehension threshold, both overall and in each
domain. With ‘Education’, no statistical differences were found in user comprehension
scores between participants with some college and those with a bachelor’s degree or
higher. While the differences between those with high school/GED or less and those with
a bachelor’s degree or higher (p<0.001) and those with high school/GED or less and
those with some college (p=0.018) are significant, the span of 2.7% difference from the
lowest to highest education category, all above the 95% threshold, is not meaningful. In
sum, the demographic make-up of the potential bias in this study relating to
nonresponse/exclusion is negligible and did not have a substantive impact on these study
results.

that we obtained approximately equal groups of participants from a wide geography within the
United States. As such, there are no target population figures for this category.
c. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Material.
A FAQ section was developed and included in each GHR Service Report. The FAQ section
was to provide users information to adequately understand the purpose of the test, limitations
of the test, meaning of the results of the test, relevance of race and ethnicity on test results,
how the results of the test may affect the user's family and children, other risks factors that
contribute to disease and appropriate follow-up procedures. Each GHR Report has answers to
the FAQs that are specific to the variant(s) of the SERPINA1 gene where applicable. The
questions included in the FAQ section for the test include, but are not limit to:
• What is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)?
• What is the Service for?
• How accurate is the Service?
• My report says l have "2 variants" in the SERPINA1 gene linked to AATD. How did
I get these variants?*
• My report says I have "2 variants, Pl*Z and Pl*Z". What are some next steps I can
take?*
• What does “at increased risk of developing lung disease linked to AATD”
compared to the general population" mean?*
• What does "at slightly increased risk of developing liver disease linked to AATD
compared to the general population" mean?*
• Can AATD be treated?
• What are the limitations of the Service?
• How can your genetic result affect your family?*
• My report says AATD is most common in people of European descent. What if
• I'm not of European descent?
• Where can I learn more about AATD?
*These FAQs depend on the GHR report type
