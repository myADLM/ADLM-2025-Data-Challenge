B Indication(s) for Use:
AnemoCheck Home is intended for home use for the determination of hemoglobin level in whole
blood from a finger stick by people over the age of 18. This device is intended for people with
anemia caused by iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, folate deficiency
anemia, or who have chronic anemia due to sickle cell disease or thalassemia. AnemoCheck
Home tests are for invitro diagnostic use only. Prescription use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
AnemoCheck Home is a semi-quantitative, colorimetric, single-use assay for hemoglobin level
determination for prescription home use. AnemoCheck Home device consists of test body and
test cap with custom injection molded plastic parts that hold the components of the test. The test
cap holds the control material which is embedded in the cap and the blood collection tube. The
test body holds the AnemoCheck Home two test vials. These components are placed in the test
cap and body during manufacturing.
B Principle of Operation:
The assay principle of AnemoCheck Home is based on the reaction among viable hemoglobin,
hydrogen peroxide, and 3,3′, 5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). When blood is mixed with the
pre-filled solution, an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction occurs between TMB and hydrogen
peroxide, leading to stable oxidized TMB products. The products exhibit different colors based
on the amount of total hemoglobin present in the sample. After 2 minutes, the resulting color of
the solution allows for visual interpretation with the naked eye by comparing to the provided
AnemoCheck Home Color card.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range is 8–18 g/dL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Transport Stability
Three different AnemoCheck Home reagent lots were tested after being exposed to different
transport conditions which included vibration testing for various time frames (1 day and 3
days), drop testing, extreme temperatures (37°C, 55°C, 4°C, and -20°C) and prolonged high
humidity (90% relative humidity for 3 days). Three levels of patient whole blood samples
(8.0, 10.0, and 12.0 g/dL) were used to evaluate the AnemoCheck test kits exposed to the
different transport conditions. Acceptance criteria were met for all conditions with the
exception of studies conducted for the test stored at -20°C. The labeling adequately addresses
the limitation that AnemoCheck tests should not be stored frozen.
Real Time Shelf Life
In order to establish the shelf life of AnemoCheck Home under specified storage conditions,
a shelf life study was conducted according to CLSI EP 25-A. Three AnemoCheck Home
reagent lots were tested at several time points (0 (T0), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 months) to
characterize reagent drift (measurand drift) over time in normal storage (room temperature)
conditions using whole blood samples at approximately 8.0, 10.0, and 12.0 g/dL. Three
replicates for each test condition, for a total of 36 data points per test condition were tested at
different time points and compared to the results at T0. Real time shelf life studies are
ongoing and to date, show no indication of measurand drift at time points up to 21 months.
The current data supports shelf life claims of 18 months from manufacture date.
Hemolysate Control Degradation
In order to assess the degradation of the hemolysate control embedded in the cap of the
AnemoCheck Home, three lots of AnemoCheck Home test control material were exposed to
high heat (55ºC and relative humidity range of 90–100%) over 12 weeks. Control material
was tested at four time points after exposure (t=0 (no exposure, control testing), 4, 8, and 12
weeks) by reconstituting the hemolysate with de-ionized water and testing the hemolysate on
a Beckman Coulter DxH 520 Hematology analyzer (K181475) to characterize the
hemoglobin level of the control after exposure to high heat and humidity. One trained
operator performed ten replicates on each lot tested for each time point. The control result
color was determined using the AnemoCheck Home color scale and compared to the control
results at time zero with no exposure. Results indicated the hemolysate control material is
stable when exposed to high heat over 12 weeks.

AnemoCheck Home Control Degradation
In order to assess the degradation of the hemolysate control as part of the AnemoCheck
Home quality control system, three lots of AnemoCheck Home test were exposed to high
heat (55ºC and relative humidity range of 90–100% ) over 12 weeks. AnemoCheck Home
tests were tested at four time points after exposure (t=0 (no exposure, control testing), 4, 8,
and 12 weeks) by reconstituting the hemolysate (by adding de-ionized water) and testing the
hemolysate on a Beckman Coulter DxH 520 Hematology analyzer (K181475) to characterize
the hemoglobin level of the control after exposure to high heat and humidity. One trained
operator performed ten replicates on each lot tested for each time point. The control result
color was determined using the AnemoCheck Home color scale and compared to the control
results. Results indicated the hemolysate control as part of the AnemoCheck Home quality
control system, appropriately degrades overtime when exposed to high heat over 12 weeks
verifying the internal quality system.
Control Degradation Color Range Study
In order to characterize the color results of normal and degraded control results in
AnemoCheck Home tests, a control degradation color range study was conducted. Three lots
of AnemoCheck Home tests were degraded to different degrees and tested on freshly
prepared blood samples. On the day of testing, venous blood was collected from a healthy
volunteer and was mechanically split into plasma and red blood cells (RBCs). Plasma and
RBCs were combined in different ratios to create blood samples with the following Hgb
values confirmed on the Beckman Coulter DxH 520 Hematology analyzer (K181475): 8.2,
10.3, 12.7 and 15.6 g/dL. Each sample was tested in triplicate across three lots of
AnemoCheck Home tests for each condition listed: no test degradation, mild test degradation
(within the green definition, 9.0 g/dL green), and moderate test degradation (borderline
yellow, 10.0+ g/dL yellow). Results indicate the color results appropriately indicate when
control degradation has occurred to ensure the quality control system metrics.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) studies
were performed using three different lots of AnemoCheck Home tests. Detection limit
studies were performed with fresh venous blood from a healthy volunteer. Blood was
mechanically split into plasma and red blood cells and combined in different ratios to create
blood samples with specific hemoglobin (Hgb) values. All sample values were confirmed on
the HemoCue Hb 201+ System (K032203). Studies were performed by one trained operator
per the AnemoCheck Home Instructions for Use on three lots with 10 replicates per lot, per
sample.
For the LoB and LoD study, four low hemoglobin samples were tested 0.0, 0.4, 0.7 and 1.4
g/dL. For both studies, the blank 0.0 g/dL did not elicit any visual color change and all other
samples elicited a blue result correlating to the lowest color block in the reportable range
when interpreted between 2–10 minute development time. The LoB is 0.0 g/dL. The LoD is
0.4 g/dL.
For the LoQ study, each sample produced differentiable results equal to or greater than 8.0
g/dL and less than or equal to 18 g/dL. Results were analyzed via linear regression across all
sample results for each lot separately and each lot produced an acceptable linear relationship
supporting limits of quantitation of 8.0 g/dL at the lower end of the range and 18.0 g/dL at
K221508 - Page 7 of 11

--- Page 8 ---
the upper end of the range. The LoQ is determined to be 8.0 g/dL and 18.0 g/dL at the lower
and upper ends of the operating range, respectively.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison:
A method comparison study was conducted in order to demonstrate substantial equivalence
between the candidate device and the predicate, HemoCue 201+ System (K032203) and the
reference method, Beckman Coulter DxH 520 Hematology analyzer (K181475). Subjects
were provided test kits that included instructions for use and kit components in a private
testing room. Subjects performed the first fingerstick using the candidate test according to the
instructions for use. This sample was considered the lay user sample. A second fingerstick
was collected in a BD Microtainer Brand Tube with EDTA (K2) (K940905) by study staff
for predicate and comparator testing after the candidate test was completed. The study was
conducted at four testing sites enrolling 83 subjects specifically targeting subjects with
anemia or at high risk of anemia including patients with iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12
deficiency, folate deficiency and anemia due to sickle cell or thalassemia.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Usability Study:
A usability study was conducted by enrolling participants in the study who were
representative of the intended users of each condition (iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12
deficiency anemia, folate deficiency anemia, or anemia due to sickle cell or thalassemia).
Results demonstrated that users were able to perform all critical tasks to complete a
successful self-test.
2. Flex Studies:
The following Flex Studies were performed at one internal site by a single trained operator.
A venous blood donation was collected into EDTA anticoagulant tubes and then
mechanically split into plasma and red blood cells (RBCs). Plasma and RBCs were then
combined in different ratios to create blood samples with the following Hgb values: 8.0, 10.0
and 12.0 g/dL. Hgb values were determined by the Beckman Coulter DxH 520 Hematology
Instrument (K181475). Testing was performed in triplicate and on three lots of AnemoCheck
Home tests for each condition. Each replicate was analyzed against the control sample level
result. All flex studies meet the predefined acceptance criteria with the exception of
underfilling, overfilling by 40% and no mixing. The labeling reflects these results.
Overfill Sample Study
A flex study was performed testing the “overfill” or when a larger than expected blood
sample (6 μL and 7 μL sample volume, or 20% and 40%, respectively) is delivered to an
AnemoCheck Home test. Overfilling by 20% or a total of 6 μL led to acceptable results.
Overfilling by 40% or a total of 7 μL led to results that were greater than >1.0 g/dL higher
than control results. This condition results in higher than expected hemoglobin levels.
Overfilling by 40% is obvious upon visual inspection as excessive blood would be present on
the test cap. Labeling reflects and informs the user that using the test with excess blood on
the cap may lead to inaccurate results.
Underfill Sample Study
A flex study was performed to evaluate device performance when the calibrated capillary
tube is underfilled by 20% less or 4 µL sample volume. Insufficient volume led to results that
were >1.0 g/dL lower compared to control results. This condition results in lower than
expected hemoglobin levels. Underfilling is obvious upon visual inspection of the blood
collection tube. Labeling reflects and informs the user that using the test with insufficient
blood in the capillary tube may lead to inaccurate results.
Sample delivery time
K221508 - Page 9 of 11

--- Page 10 ---
A flex study was performed to evaluate the device performance when testing is delayed five
minutes after sample collection. This study is to characterize the effect of the time delay
allowed before sample addition and if accurate test results can be obtained. After sample
collection into sample collection tube, the sample was delayed to the insertion of the test
body for five minutes. All replicates were within 1.0 g/dL compared to the control sample
results. The effect of prolonged waiting in sample tube is mitigated by the presence of coated
anticoagulant on the insides of the sample collection tube.
Undermixed test
A flex study was performed to evaluate the device performance when the sample is not
mixed and undermixed (3 seconds of mixing). Mixing drives the removal of
sample from capillary tube and the end-user is instructed to mix for 5–10 seconds. This study
is to characterize the mixing time required for sample addition and control testing. No mixing
yielded all invalid results (no control color present). Undermixing (3 seconds of mixing) the
sample yields acceptable results compared to the control test. Labeling reflects and informs
the user that undermixing can lead to inaccurate results.
Incorrect development time
A flex study was performed to evaluate the device performance when the control and test are
read at different times. Control and tests are instructed to be read after 2 minutes and before
10 minutes. Control and test results were read at 1.5, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes.
All replicates were within 1.0 g/dL compared to the control sample results for all times
tested. Labeling reflects the appropriate development time to the end-user.
Environmental Factors Flex Studies
A flex study was performed to evaluate the device performance under extreme environmental
conditions (33℃ and 90% relative humidity). The testing of all replicates was performed
under the extreme conditions from start to finish. All replicates were within 1.0 g/dL
compared to the control sample results and acceptable.
Open Vial Stability
A flex study was performed to evaluate the device performance if the screw caps were
remove from the test body and the vials of the test body were exposed to air for 5 minutes
and 10 minutes. The end-user is instructed to remove the screws caps and immediately insert
the test cap into the test body. All replicates were within the 1.0 g/dL compared to the control
