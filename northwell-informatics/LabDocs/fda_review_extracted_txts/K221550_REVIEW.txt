C Type of Test:
Chemiluminescent immunoassay
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Evidence MultiSTAT DOA Urine MultiPlex is intended for use with the Evidence
MultiSTAT. The Evidence MultiSTAT is an analyzer intended for the qualitative determination
of parent drug molecule and metabolites of drugs in human urine at the associated cutoffs.
The Evidence MultiSTAT DOA Urine MultiPlex detects the following drugs at the following
cut-offs:
Analyte Analyte in Cut Off Material Cut-Off
Phenobarbital Phenobarbital 200 ng/ml
Tramadol Tramadol 200 ng/ml
Phencyclidine Phencyclidine 25 ng/ml
Buprenorphine Norbuprenorphine 5 ng/ml
6-Acetylmorphine 6-Acetylmorphine 10 ng/ml
The Evidence MultiSTAT DOA Urine MultiPlex provides only a preliminary analytical test
result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and/or Liquid
Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) are the preferred confirmatory
methods. Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and
professional judgement should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
preliminary positive results are obtained.
For In Vitro Diagnostic use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Evidence MultiSTAT
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Evidence MultiSTAT is a benchtop fully automated Biochip Array System analyzer. The
Evidence MultiSTAT DOA Urine MultiPlex test kit components include a sealed urine test

B Principle of Operation:
The candidate device performs simultaneous detection of multiple analytes from a single sample.
The core technology is the Randox Biochip, a solid-state device containing an array of discrete
test regions containing immobilized antibodies specific to different Drugs of Abuse (DOA)
compound classes. A competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay is used for the DOA assays
with the drug in the specimen and drug labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) being in
direct competition for the antibody binding sites. Increased levels of drug in a specimen will lead
to reduced binding of drug labelled with HRP and thus a reduction in chemiluminescence being
emitted. The light signal generated from each of the test regions on the biochip is detected by a
Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera in the Evidence MultiSTAT analyzer which, together
with the analyzer software, is used to quantify the light output and produce results. The tests
employ a qualitative reporting method. Each test sample is assayed against the provided Cut Off
material of known concentration, which is used to determine the classification of the samples
based on the comparison of the signal output.
The immunoassay processes are performed automatically in a self-contained and sealed biochip
cartridge, which holds the biochips, the reagents, wash buffer and other fluids required for the
test to be conducted.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable. These devices are intended for qualitative use only.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Potential interference from various compounds were tested by spiking the potentially
interfering compound into drug-free urine containing the target drug concentrations at 50%
below and 50% above the threshold cut off level. If interference was observed, the interferent
was titrated down and the concentration at which no interference is observed quoted. The
following exogenous compounds were found not to interfere with test results when tested up
to the concentrations identified in the table below.

Analytical Specificity:
To test cross-reactivity, drug metabolites and other compounds that may be present in human
urine samples were tested using three (3) lots of the candidate device. The sponsor identified
the concentration of each compound prepared in drug free negative urine that would produce
a positive response for each assay when analyzed against the cut off material. The following
is a summary of the cross-reactivity study. The individual assays are calibrated against the
compounds marked with an asterisk (*).

Specific gravity and pH:
The effect of specific gravity for each analyte was evaluated by testing positive (50% above
cutoff) and negative samples (50% below cutoff) at specific gravities ranging from 1.000 to
1.030. No interference was observed for all specific gravities tested.
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate whether low or high pH causes negative or
positive interference with the candidate device. Samples containing the claimed drugs at
concentrations corresponding to -50% and +50% of the cutoff were adjusted to pH levels
ranging from 3.0 to 11.0. Aside from 6-Acetylmorphine at pH 11, none of the pH levels
tested caused a positive result at -50% of the cutoff or a negative result at +50% of the cutoff,
as described below:

A method comparison study was conducted using 878 clinical samples obtained from one (1)
site and tested on the candidate device and compared to results from a LC-MS/MS
quantitative comparator method. Phenobarbital results were compared to results from a
GC/MS quantitative comparator method. Results are summarized below.
