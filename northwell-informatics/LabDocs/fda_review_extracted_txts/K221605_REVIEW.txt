B Indication(s) for Use:
The Emit® II Plus Buprenorphine Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay with a 5
ng/mL cutoff. The assay is intended for use in laboratories for the qualitative and/or
semiquantitative analyses of buprenorphine in human urine. Emit® II Plus assays are designed
for use with a number of chemistry analyzers.
The semiquantitative mode is for the purpose of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as Liquid
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish quality
control procedures.
The Emit® II Plus Buprenorphine Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A
more specific alternative chemical method(s) must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical
result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or LC/MS are the preferred
confirmatory methods. Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug-of-abuse test result,
particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
For Professional Use.
Caution: Federal (USA) law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a licensed
healthcare professional.
For in vitro diagnostic use.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
For Prescription Use Only.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
All performance studies were conducted on the DxC 500 AU Clinical Chemistry Analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Emit® II Plus Buprenorphine Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay consisting of
the following components:
Antibody/Substrate
Reagent 1
Mouse monoclonal antibodies to buprenorphine (0.53 µg/mL) NAD (6.9 mM), G6P (10.9 mM),
bovine serum albumin, preservatives, and stabilizers.
K221605 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
Enzyme
Reagent 2
Norbuprenorphine labeled with bacterial rG6PDH (0.50 µg/mL), HEPES buffer, bovine serum
albumin, preservatives, and stabilizers.
B Principle of Operation:
The Emit® II Plus Buprenorphine Assay is a homogenous enzyme immunoassay. The assay is
based upon competition between drug in the specimen and drug labeled with the recombinant
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (rG6PDH) for the antibody binding sites. Active enzyme
converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH in the presence of glucose-6-
phosphate (G6P), resulting in an absorbance change that is measured spectrophotometrically.

1. Analytical Performance:
a. Precision/Repeatability and Within-lab Precision:
Repeatability and within lab precision studies were conducted using urine pools spiked with
Buprenorphine into drug free human urine at 11 concentrations. For each level, samples were
analyzed in duplicate twice a day, for 20 days (N=80). The precision study design was
guided by recommendations in CLSI EP05-A3. The results are summarized below for the
qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses.

Reproducibility studies were conducted with urine samples at 3 concentration levels using
the semi-quantitative mode. Samples were assayed in 5 replicates in 1 run for 5 days using 3
instruments and 3 reagent lots. The data were analyzed to calculate the following
components of precision: repeatability, between-day, between-lot, between-instrument, and
total reproducibility.

Endogenous Substances Interference:
Each compound was spiked into samples with -40% cutoff and +40% cutoff concentration
pools which were prepared by spiking buprenorphine to aliquots of drug-free human urine.
The results show that the tested endogenous substances at the levels tested caused no
interference relative to the 5 ng/mL cutoff. Testing was conducted using both the qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes. Results are provided in the table below.

Specific Gravity and pH:
Negative urine pools with specific gravity values ranging from 1.002–1.035 and pH values
ranging from 3.0–11.0 were tested in the presence of two levels of controls at +/- 40% (3 and
7 ng/mL) of the cutoff concentration. All samples were tested in triplicates and no
interference was observed.
d. Assay Reportable Range:
See linearity section (1 b.) above.
e. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Emit® II Plus Specialty Drug Calibrator/Control is traceable to a commercially available
standard.
f. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
g. Assay Cut-Off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in the precision
section (section VII, A1) above.
2. Comparison Studies:
a. Method comparison
One-hundred twenty (120) unaltered human urine samples were qualitatively and semi-
quantitatively evaluated using the Emit® II Plus Buprenorphine Assay system and
compared with the results obtained by the reference method LC/MS/MS. The results are
presented below:
