III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
AlloMap Heart Molecular Expression Testing is an In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index assay
(IVDMIA) test service, performed in a single laboratory, assessing the gene expression profile of
RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). AlloMap Heart Testing is
intended to aid in the identification of heart transplant recipients with stable allograft function
who have a low probability of moderate/severe acute cellular rejection (ACR) at the time of
testing in conjunction with standard clinical assessment.
Indicated for use in heart transplant recipients:
• 15 years of age or older
• At least 2 months (≥55 days) post-transplantation
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Roche LightCycler 480 II (qualified by CareDx, Inc.), which replace the RT-PCR instruments
used with the device in DEN080007/k073482.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
AlloMap Heart Molecular Expression Testing is an In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assay
(IVDMIA) test service performed in a single laboratory. It assesses the gene expression profile
of RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using quantitative reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Gene expression levels are converted to an
AlloMap Test Score, which is reported to the physician.
The following sample collection supplies are provided by CareDx to ordering
laboratories/physicians:
• 8 mL BD Vacutainer® CPT™ Cell Preparation Tubes with Sodium Citrate (CPT) (only
tubes supplied by CareDx should be used)
• AlloMap sample processing reagent kit (10 centrifuge tubes containing 5 mL phosphate
buffered saline, 10 tubes containing 1.8 mL of LyseDx™ lysing reagent, 10 sterile disposable
transfer pipettes, 1 package insert with instructions for use, 1 quick reference card)
• CareDx Frozen Shipper Pack
K221640 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
Principle of Operation:
Blood specimen collection at the referring facility is initiated by a physician order. Whole blood
is drawn from the patient into blood collection tubes supplied by CareDx. PBMCs are separated
from whole blood via centrifugation, washed, pelleted, and lysed using reagents supplied by
CareDx. The lysate is stored frozen and shipped to the CareDx laboratory using kits provided by
CareDx. Upon arrival at the CareDx laboratory, samples are inspected and accessioned into the
Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) database that tracks all workflow steps.
RNA from the PBMC lysate is purified and quantified with a spectrophotometer. Upon meeting
RNA quantity and purity acceptance criteria, liquid handling instruments are used to dispense
samples and reagents into 96-well reaction plates. RNA is converted to cDNA via a reverse
transcriptase protocol on a thermal cycler. The cDNA is then diluted and dispensed using liquid
handling instruments into 384-well AlloMap plates containing qRT-PCR reagents. qRT-PCR of
20 genes (11 informative and 9 used for normalization and quality control) is carried out using
qRT-PCR instruments. Multiple automated quality control (QC) checks are performed on every
sample.
For all samples that pass QC, CareDx Analyzer software converts the expression levels
determined for the 20 genes into an AlloMap Test Score (an integer ranging from 0 to 40) using
a proprietary algorithm. Final reports are signed off by the clinical laboratory scientists in the
CareDx laboratory and are sent to the ordering physician. The physician interprets the results
along with other standard clinical assessments of cardiac allograft status to determine probability
of ACR.
AlloMap Heart Molecular Expression Testing is only performed at the CLIA-certified and CAP-
accredited clinical laboratory at CareDx in Brisbane, CA.
B Instrument Description Information:

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A study was conducted to determine the precision of the AlloMap Heart Molecular
Expression Testing. Three cDNA pools created from RNA isolated from blood samples from
heart transplant patients and that cover the range of AlloMap scores (i.e., 16.2 (low), 28.5
(medium), and 37.5 (high)) were tested using two operators over five non-consecutive days.
On each day, each cDNA pool was tested in each of six sections per plate and on each of
three plate lots. The three plates for each pool were tested across three LC480 instruments. A
total of 90 replicates (6 replicates/plate x 3 plates/day x 5 days) was conducted per pool and
replicates that passed established quality control metrics were included in the analysis. The
results of the testing are shown below.

An additional study was conducted to establish between-instrument variability among the
eight LC480 instruments qualified by the CareDx laboratory for the candidate device. Three
cDNA pools created from RNA isolated from blood samples from heart transplant patients
and that cover the range of AlloMap scores (i.e., 17.5 (low), 29.0 (medium), and 34.5 (high))
were tested. Each cDNA pool was tested in each of six sections per plate and on each of three
plates from one lot of plates. The three plates for each pool were tested on each of eight
LC480 instruments for a total of 144 replicates (6 sections/plate x 3 plates/instrument x 8
instruments) per pool. Replicates that passed established quality control metrics were
included in the analysis. Between-instrument results along with between-plate variability,

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Quality control materials and procedures remain unchanged from DEN080007/k073482.
Sample stability study protocols and data were reviewed and found acceptable. Patient RNA
samples are stored for up to 6 months at < -65°C and patient cDNA samples are stored for up
to 6 months at < -15°C. RNA controls are stored for up to 16 months at < -65°C and cDNA
controls are stored for up to 45 months at -15°C to -35°C.
6. Detection Limit:
A study was conducted to confirm that a minimum RNA yield of 400 ng is required to run
the assay. A pool of patient RNA samples with an AlloMap score of 34.6 was tested in RNA
inputs ranging from 150 to 500 ng to generate cDNA. Each cDNA was tested three times in
the same plate section across three plates from the same lot using one LC480 instrument. The
results confirmed the minimum RNA yield of 400 ng.
As established in DEN080007/k073482, the blood collection procedure yields sufficient
RNA to run the AlloMap test on 98% of patient samples, the acceptable A /A ratio range
260 280
for testing is 1.5 to 3.5, and each gene assay must provide a C at or below 38 to generate a
T
test score.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
See the method comparison with predicate device study in section VII.B.1.
9. Carry-Over:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted using 163 heart transplant patient RNA samples
spanning the range of AlloMap scores. cDNA was generated from each RNA sample and
each cDNA was tested on two candidate devices (with Roche LightCycler 480II (LC480)
instruments) and one predicate device (with Applied Biosystems Incorporated 7900HT
(7900HT) instruments).
Passing-Bablok regression analysis was conducted with the AlloMap scores from each pair
of predicate and candidate devices used in the method comparison study. The results were as
follows:
K221640 - Page 7 of 9

--- Page 8 ---
Comparison Slope estimate Intercept estimate R2
(95% confidence (95% confidence
interval) interval)
Candidate 1 (0.99, 1.01) 0 (-0.53, 0.53) 0.9603
device 1 vs.
predicate device
Candidate 1 (0.99, 1.01) 0 (-034, 0.34) 0.9512
device 2 vs.
predicate device
An allowable total difference (ATD) analysis was conducted with the method comparison
data and within-laboratory imprecision estimates for the predicate device according to FDA’s
guidance document “Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices” (issued on
April 25, 2013). The analysis showed that over 98% of the samples over the entire AlloMap
score range fell within the ATD zones with the lower limit of the 95% one-sided confidence
interval being above 94% for both candidate devices tested. Therefore, it was concluded that
the candidate device performance is comparable to the predicate device performance since
the majority of the candidate device measurements fall within the imprecision of the
predicate device.
Analyses were provided that demonstrated that the mean NPV and PPV differences between
the candidate and predicate devices were within 1% for NPV and within 2% for PPV for both
the 2-6 month and > 6 month post-transplant periods.
2. Matrix Comparison:

patients was established in DEN080007/k073482.
