IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Nova Allegro UACR Assay
The Allegro UACR Assay measures Albumin and Creatinine in human urine. The UACR is
calculated by the Allegro Analyzer. The Allegro UACR Test Cartridge contains all of the
reagents for measuring albumin and creatinine.
Cartridge Description:
The main components of the Test Cartridge are the Capillary, the reaction chamber, and the
barcode label.
The Allegro UACR test cartridge contains 3 reagent solutions as described in the following table:
Sample Diluent 0.2% w/v 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid, 4% polyethylene glycol in 100 mM
tris buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, with 2.5% other ingredients
(stabilizers, preservatives) (350 µL per cartridge)
Albumin Reagent 10 – 15 mg/mL delipidated goat IgG fraction containing anti-human
albumin in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl with 2.2% other ingredients
(stabilizers, preservatives) (105 µL per cartridge)
Creatinine Reagent 15% potassium hydroxide, 0.5M dipotassium hydrogen phosphate,
with 2% other ingredients (stabilizers, preservatives). (120 µL per
cartridge).
Nova Allegro Analyzer
The Nova Allegro Analyzer is a compact, point-of-care analyzer. All tests are measured with
disposable, ready-to-use cartridges. The analyzer supports multiple wavelengths that are used to
measure the assay of interest. The analyzer consists of the following key systems/components
that the user interacts with:
• Two analytical bays where the single use test cartridges are analyzed
• Color Touchscreen Display
• Barcode Scanner
• Printer
• Data Export Options
• Ethernet Connection
• USB Port
B Principle of Operation:
The Allegro UACR Test Cartridge contains all reagents required for measuring albumin and
creatinine. When a human urine sample is introduced into a Test Cartridge by a capillary,
albumin present in a urine sample reacts with antibody specific against human albumin and
antibody-albumin complex is formed resulting in turbidity increase measured by absorbance at

405 nm. The amount of complex is in direct proportion to the amount of albumin in the sample.
The albumin is then quantified using a calibration curve.
The Benedict/Behre chemistry is the basis for the creatinine assay. 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid at
high pH reacts with creatinine to form a colored complex at 530 nm. The colored complex is in
direct proportion to the amount of creatinine in the sample which is determined from a stored
calibration curve. The albumin to creatinine ratio, UACR, is then calculated and displayed on the
Nova Allegro Analyzer.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Nova Allegro Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification can be done by scanning a patient identification bar code or by
manual entry.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A single-use, disposable capillary sample collection device is used to obtain and load the
sample. The capillary sample collection device containing the sample is loaded onto the test
cartridge, then the test cartridge is placed into the sample bay within 1 minute of sample
collection and the start icon is pressed to start analysis.
4. Calibration:
The reagent test cartridge includes a scannable 2D barcode containing the stored calibration
curve.
5. Quality Control:
External Quality Control (QC) material is used to monitor the performance of the analyzer
and the test cartridges used with the analyzer and to verify the analyzer is performing to
specifications. QC recommendations are found in the labeling.

2. Linearity:
A study was performed to validate the Nova Allegro UACR Assay linearity and reportable
ranges described below:
Range Levels Slope Intercept r Reportable
Evaluated Range
Albumin 0 – 362 mg/L 9 0.994 2.52 0.997 5 – 300 mg/L
Creatinine 0 – 507 mg/dL 9 0.997 4.73 0.999 15 – 500 mg/dL
If the albumin or creatinine value is outside the reportable range, no ACR test result will be
reported.
Hook Effect Study
A study was performed to validate and determine at what concentration level the Nova
Allegro UACR Assay exhibits a characteristic “Hook Effect” when measuring albumin. No
“Hook effect” was observed with albumin up to 50,000 mg/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
A study was performed to test for potentially interfering substances with the Nova Allegro

UACR Assay according to Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline -
Third Edition: CLSI EP07-A3.
Ten (10) replicate measurements were made on both prepared specimens containing each
potential interfering substance and control specimens containing no interfering substance.
The mean albumin and creatinine concentration of the ten (10) replicates for both the test and
control pools for each of the interfering substances, and percent difference between the mean
test value and the mean control value were calculated. Acceptance criteria for interfering
substance is <10%.
Albumin concentrations were targeted to approximately 20 mg/L and 220 mg/L and
creatinine, targeted to approximately 56 mg/dL and 450 mg/dL with the interferents as
described in the table below.

Effects of urine pH: Five (5) fresh urine specimens were pooled and divided into two sample
pools. Both samples were then divided into 7 aliquots and the pH of the aliquots were adjusted
to have pH values of 4.0, 4.3, 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0. The results demonstrated that
changes in pH ranging from 4.3 to 9.0 do not interfere with the results of albumin and creatinine.
Effects of urine specific gravity:
Fresh urine samples with low specific gravity (<1.005) were pooled and divided into six (6)
aliquots. Five (5) aliquots were adjusted to specific gravity of 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 1.04, and 1.05
and spiked with a combination of albumin and creatinine. The results demonstrated that changes
in specific gravity ranging from 1.003 to 1.048 do not interfere with the results of albumin and
creatinine.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Albumin calibration standards are traceable to BCR/CRM 470 IFCC reference materials and
creatinine calibration standards are traceable to NIST SRM 914.
6. Detection Limit:
Studies for detection limit were conducted following CLSI EP 17-A2.
Three (3) Nova Allegro Analyzers and three (3) lots of Nova Allegro UACR Test Cartridges
were used in the study. Sixty (60) replicate measurements were tested to determine the limit
of blank (LOB) and the limit of detection (LOD) and thirty six (36) replicate measurements
were tested to determine the limit of quantitation (LOQ). Nova Allegro Urine Calibrator
base matrix was used for determining the LOB. Urine samples spiked with albumin and
creatinine were used for determining the LOD and LOQ. The total error goal for LOQ were
defined as <2 mg/L for albumin and <3 mg/dL for creatinine.

Albumin 1.9 mg/L 2.1 mg/L 3.5 mg/L
Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL 2.6 mg/dL 4.4 mg/dL

8. Accuracy (Instrument):
See Section VII.B.1 Method Comparison with Predicate Device.
9. Carry over:
The Nova Allegro UACR Test Cartridges are fully self-contained test cartridges. The
sponsor describes that no contact is made between the system instrumentation and the
reagents or test sample.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Point-of-Care (POC) Method Comparison studies on fresh urine specimens were conducted
within four (4) different POC sites using methods described in CLSI “Method Comparison
and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline – Third Edition”, CLSI
EP09c.
A total of eight (8) Nova Allegro Analyzers (2 per site) and three (3) lots of Allegro UACR
Test Cartridges were used in the study. At each site, a minimum of 3 operators conducted the
