A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
ALFIS Vitamin D in conjunction with ALFIS-3 Analyzer is an enzyme-linked fluorescence
immunoassay intended for in vitro diagnostic use at clinical laboratories for the quantitative
measurement of Total 25-hydroxy Vitamin D (25-OH Vitamin D) in human serum, lithium
heparin plasma and sodium heparin plasma.
ALFIS Vitamin D is indicated to be used as an aid in the determination of Vitamin D sufficiency
in adults.
ALFIS-3 Analyzer is a fluorescence-scanning instrument using magnetic beads and alkaline
phosphatase enzyme system for in vitro diagnostic use in conjunction with various ALFIS
immunoassays intended for measuring the concentration of designated analytes in human blood
and other specimens.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
ALFIS-3 Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
ALFIS-3 Analyzer
The ALFIS-3 Analyzer is an automated, fluorometric analyzer intended to perform in vitro
diagnostic tests on clinical specimens. The system is intended for quantitative analysis of body
fluids.
ALFIS Vitamin D
The ALFIS Vitamin D test kit is comprised of 24 ALFIS Vitamin D test cartridges, 1 ALFIS
Vitamin D test ID Chip, 24 pipette tips, and 24 magnetic tips.
ALFIS Vitamin D Test Cartridge
The ALFIS Vitamin D Test Cartridge is a disposable, self-contained, unitized device which
houses the magnetic bead, antibody-alkaline phosphatase-conjugator, sample diluent,
diethanolamine, 4-Methylumbelliferyl phosphate, and washing buffer. Cartridges are provided in
individually sealed aluminum pouches. The magnetic bead well contains one lyophilized
magnetic bead which is conjugated with streptavidin and Vitamin D antibody-biotin complex.
K221817 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
ALFIS Vitamin D Test ID Chip
ALFIS Vitamin D Test ID Chip is a lot-specific electronic memory device. Each lot-specific
Vitamin D Test ID chip contains an encoded master calibration curve data/equation which is
meant to compensate for the lot-to-lot variation in ALFIS Vitamin D test cartridges on test
results. Apart from the lot-specific calibration curve the ALFIS Vitamin D test ID chip also
contains other information such as name of the test, test cartridge, lot number, expiry date,
reportable ranges etc.
Materials required, but not supplied: ALFIS-3 Analyzer, ALFIS Vitamin D Calibrators, ALFIS
Vitamin D Controls.
B Principle of Operation:
The ALFIS Vitamin D assay is an enzyme-linked fluorescence immunoassay. To quantitatively
measure total 25-hydroxyvitamin D in human serum or plasma, a magnetic tip and pipette tip
provided with the test kit are inserted into the designated sites on the analyzer. The sample (100
µL) is added to the sample well. The test cartridge is inserted into the analyzer and the following
steps are performed automatically within the instrument: an antibody is labeled with an alkaline
phosphatase enzyme and other reagents are conjugated with a magnetic bead. Upon interaction
between antigen and enzyme-labeled antibody, a substrate is added, and fluorescence product is
formed by catalytic action of enzyme. The obtained fluorescence intensity of a substrate is
proportional to the amount of analyte. ALFIS-3 uses an amplified photodetector (APD) module
for the measurement of UV light intensity as a light detector. The fluorescent light is collected
with together the scattered UV light. Pure fluorescence is filtered from the scattered UV and
fluorescent light. The exact fluorescence intensity is measured by APD module and converted
into the relative fluorescence ratio (RFR) which is correlated with the concentration of target
analytes in the sample. The on-board microprocessor computes the concentration of the analyte
in the test sample based on proprietary software. Computed and converted test result are
displayed on the display screen of the ALFIS-3.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
ALFIS-3 Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Human serum, Lithium heparin and Sodium heparin samples are identified by the lot specific
barcode that identifies the lot number of the ALFIS Vitamin D test cartridge while it
undergoes scanning in the ALFIS-3 analyzer.
Specimen Identification can be done by writing patient ID on the space labeled Patient ID on
the sample cartridge. The lot specific barcode signifies the identity and lot number of the
ALFIS Vitamin D test cartridge while it undergoes scanning in the ALFIS-3 analyzer.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This sample is loaded into the sample well of the ALFIS Vitamin D test cartridge. An
opening at the right end of the cartridge housing acts as the “scanning well’ as the sample
loaded test cartridge undergoes scanning in ALFIS-3 analyzer after automated pipetting-
mixing steps and reactions as part of the assay.
K221817 - Page 3 of 11

--- Page 4 ---
The sample handling system consists of the ALFIS vitamin D test cartridge, the magnetic tip,
and the pipette tip. The pipette tip is inserted into the pipette tip hole and dispenses washing
buffer from the washing buffer well, into the magnetic bead well.

2. Linearity:
The linearity performance of the ALFIS vitamin D assay on the ALFIS-3 analyzer was
established in a study conducted following the recommendations of CLSI guideline EP06-A.
Two sample panels were prepared: in the first panel, 10 samples were prepared by
intermixing a serum sample spiked with a high concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with a
depleted, low analyte serum sample to cover a range of 13 to 130 ng/mL. In the second panel,
9 serum samples were prepared by intermixing a serum sample spiked with a low
concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with a depleted, low analyte serum sample to cover a
range of 1.3 to 11.7 ng/mL. Each sample was assayed in triplicate using one lot of ALFIS
Vitamin D test cartridges and one ALFIS-3 analyzer. The results of the linearity study
support the claimed measuring interval of 6-100 ng/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous Interferences:
Potential interference from endogenous substances was evaluated. For each interfering
substance, pooled native serum samples with concentrations representing low, middle, and
high vitamin D were tested. An aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering
substances. Each sample was measured in triplicate using one lot of ALFIS Vitamin D test
cartridge on one ALFIS-3 analyzer. The following substances were tested up to the levels
indicated and demonstrated no significant interference (≤10%).

(without any added interferent) acted as control samples. To evaluate potential interference,
test samples for each interferent were prepared by adding specified concentration of the
respective interferent to the serum samples. The results were analyzed as percent recovery
between the test sample and the control sample. The substance was considered to have no
significant interference if the recovery was 90-110%.

results. Carefully evaluate results if the sample is suspected of having these types of
interferences.
Cross-reactivity
A study was conducted to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of the assay with other
vitamin D metabolites. In the study, three test samples were prepared by adding specified
concentrations of the respective cross-reactant to 25 hydroxyvitamin D-spiked serum samples

High-dose hook effect was assessed on the ALFIS Vitamin D test. Ten (10) serum samples
were spiked to achieve 25-OH Vitamin D concentration of 1000 ng/mL. Each test sample
was tested in triplicate on the same day by the same operator with one lot of ALFIS Vitamin
D test cartridges using one ALFIS-3 analyzer. The study results show that there was no hook
effect up to 1000 ng/mL of 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration.

Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD was evaluated by testing 4 low level spiked serum samples using three lots of test
cartridges on three analyzers (1 lot per analyzer) for 3 successive days. Each sample was
measured in 5 replicates for a total of 60 measurements per lot. The LoD was calculated by
parametric analysis which was the lowest concentration of which the analyte can be detected
with 95% probability. The claimed LoD is 3.76 ng/mL.
Limit of Quantification (LoQ)
The LoQ was evaluated using 5 low level spiked serum samples using three lots of test
cartridges on three analyzers (1 lot/analyzer). Each sample was tested in replicates of four
across each lot on 3 successive days for a total of 36 replicates per sample. The data was
visually inspected to find out the lowest concentration of analyte which has imprecision less
than or equal to 20% CV. The LoQ of the assay was found to be 6.0 ng/mL with inter-assay
CV < 20%.
