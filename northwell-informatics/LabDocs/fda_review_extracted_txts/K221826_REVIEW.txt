C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Limitations:
• The ability of the BD BBL Sensi Disc to detect resistance with the following
combination(s) is unknown because an insufficient number of resistant strains
were encountered at the time of comparative testing: Cefiderocol (30μg) and
Enterobacterales group, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. If such a
K221826 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
strain is encountered, it should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further
testing.
• While the categorical agreement for BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol compared to
FDA cleared Disk analysis was > 95% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Acinetobacter baumannii complex, categorical agreement for BD BBL Sensi-Disc
Cefiderocol compared to historical BMD MIC values was below 90%, caused by
the occurrence of false susceptible results and minor errors. Test results for
Cefiderocol/P. aeruginosa which provide a disc zone of inhibition ≥ 22 mm, and
test results for Cefiderocol/A. baumannii which provide a disc zone of inhibition
≥ 19 mm, should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory
information.
• While the categorical agreement for BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol compared to
FDA cleared Disk analysis was > 95% for Enterobacterales group organisms,
categorical agreement for BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol compared to historical
BMD MIC values resulted in false susceptible results. Citrobacter freundii
complex, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, and
Proteus mirabilis isolates that provide a disc zone of inhibition ≥ 16 mm should
be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory information.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol 30 μg (FDC30) device is comprised of 6 mm discs
prepared by impregnating high quality absorbent paper with accurately determined amounts of
Cefiderocol. Discs are clearly marked on both sides with the code FDC30. The code designates
the agent Cefiderocol (FDC) and the drug content (30 µg).
BD BBL Sensi-Disc Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Discs are supplied in cartridges
containing 50 discs each. The last disc in each cartridge is marked “X” and contains the drug as
coded. BD BBL Sensi-Disc Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Discs can be dispensed using a
BD BBL Sensi-Disc Dispenser.
B Principle of Operation:
Filter paper discs impregnated with specified concentrations of antimicrobial agents are used to
perform disk diffusion susceptibility testing. The test is performed by inoculating pure cultures
of clinical isolates onto the suitable medium and placing the AST disc on the surface of the
medium. The antibiotic within the disc diffuses into the agar. After incubation, the zones of
K221826 - Page 3 of 11

--- Page 4 ---
inhibition around the discs are measured and compared against recognized zone diameter ranges
for the specific antimicrobial agent/organism combinations being tested.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was conducted at one external site using 15 isolates, tested in triplicate with
two disc lots on three separate days using one lot of BD Mueller Hinton agar (MHA) media.
Each test was visually read by three independent readers with results blinded to avoid any
bias results, resulting in 270 data points for evaluation (15 isolates x 2 disc lots x 3 days = 90
test results read by 3 independent readers = 270 data points).
The reproducibility study included the following species, indicated on the FDA-approved
drug label: 11 Enterobacterales (1 Citrobacter koseri, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 2 Escherichia
coli, 1 Klebsiella aerogenes, 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 Morganella morganii, 1 Proteus
mirabilis, 1 Proteus vulgaris, 1 Serratia marcescens), 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1
Acinetobacter baumannii.
Reproducibility was calculated as the percent of results which were within ±3 mm difference
in zone diameter comparing test results with the modal zone diameter value. Summary results
between disc lots and across readers are shown in Table 1.

Category Agreement (CA) is when the BD result interpretation agrees exactly with the comparator result interpretation.
Performance when testing the total 357 clinical and challenge isolates are shown in Table 3
and summarized below.
• The overall performance of the BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol disc as compared to the
FDA cleared comparator disc for Enterobacterales group (Table 3) is acceptable with
98.4% CA. There were 4 minor errors and no major or very major errors.
• The overall performance of the BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol disc as compared to the
FDA cleared comparator disc for P. aeruginosa group (Table 3) is acceptable with 98.2%
CA. There was 1 minor error and no major or very major errors.
• The overall performance of the BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol disc as compared to the
FDA cleared comparator disc for Acinetobacter baumannii group (Table 3) is acceptable
with 95.5% CA. There were 2 minor errors and no major or very major errors.
As required under 511A(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the following
statement is included in the ‘Warnings and Precautions’ section in the device labeling to address
testing of non-indicated species:
“Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.”

Resistance Isolates:
A total of 357 clinical and challenge isolates were tested when the BD BBL Sensi-Disc was
compared to the FDA cleared comparator disc. However, an insufficient number of resistant
isolates were available for testing. To address the lack of resistant strains encountered during
the clinical evaluation, the following limitation was added in the device labeling:
“The ability of the BD BBL Sensi Disc to detect resistance with the following
combination(s) is unknown because an insufficient number of resistant strains were
encountered at the time of comparative testing: Cefiderocol (30μg) and Enterobacterales
group, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. If such a strain is encountered, it
should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing”.
Secondary Analysis:
A secondary analysis of the results obtained with the 357 clinical and challenge isolates was
also performed. The analysis was conducted to assess the qualitative categorical agreement
(CA) of the BD BBL Sensi-Disc diffusion results compared to the reference broth
microdilution (BMD) results (based on historical MIC data from BMD testing performed at
the initial recovery of isolates during the drug clinical trial). Analysis of the BD BBL Sensi-
Disc when tested against the historical MIC value for each isolate showed a high number of
categorical errors. The results of the BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol versus historical MIC
values are summarized below.
• The analysis of the BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol compared to historical BMD
MIC values for P. aeruginosa had a low CA of 75.4% due to the high number of
minor errors (6) and 8 very major errors (8/10 80.0%). There were no major errors.
Refer to limitation below.
• The analysis of the BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol compared to historical BMD
MIC values for Acinetobacter baumannii complex had a low CA of 61.4% due to
the high number of minor errors (7), very major errors (9/20, 45.0%) and one major
error (1/24, 4.2%). This single major error was accepted as a random error and did
not require a limitation.
To address the low CA due to categorical errors obtained with Cefiderocol when tested
with P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii complex, the following limitation was added to
the device labeling:
“While the categorical agreement for BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol compared
to FDA cleared Disk analysis was >95% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Acinetobacter baumannii complex, categorical agreement for BD BBL Sensi-Disc
Cefiderocol compared to historical BMD MIC values was below 90%, caused by
the occurrence of false susceptible results and minor errors. Test results for
Cefiderocol/P. aeruginosa which provide a disc zone of inhibition ≥ 22 mm, and
test results for Cefiderocol/A. baumannii complex which provide a disc zone of
K221826 - Page 9 of 11

--- Page 10 ---
inhibition ≥ 19 mm, should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and
laboratory information”.
• The analysis of the BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol compared to historical BMD
MIC values for Enterobacterales is acceptable with 93.0% CA. However, the very
major error (VMJ) rate was 41.2% (7/17) which does not meet FDA’s acceptance
criteria of ≤ 2% VMJ error rate. There were 11 minor errors and no major errors.
To address the categorical errors obtained with Cefiderocol when tested with
Enterobacterales, the following limitation was added to the device labeling:
“While the categorical agreement for BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol compared
to FDA cleared Disk analysis was > 95% for Enterobacterales group organisms,
categorical agreement for BD BBL Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol compared to historical
BMD MIC values resulted in false susceptible results. Citrobacter freundii
complex, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, and
Proteus mirabilis isolates that provide a disc zone of inhibition ≥ 16 mm should
be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory information.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that Becton
Dickinson, and Company (BD Diagnostic Systems) intends to use to evaluate the BD BBL
Sensi-Disc Cefiderocol 30µg (FDC-30) when revised breakpoints for Cefiderocol are published
on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the submission
indicated that if specific criteria are met, BD Diagnostic Systems will update the Cefiderocol
30µg device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after
re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new
limitations as determined by their evaluation.
