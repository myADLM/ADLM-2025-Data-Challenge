III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of thyroglobulin in human serum and
plasma. Determination of Tg is used as an aid in monitoring for the presence of persistent or
recurrent/metastatic disease in patients who have differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and have
had thyroid surgery (with or without ablative therapy).
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on cobas e
immunoassay analyzers.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
The Instruction for Use of the Elecsys Tg II contains the following blackbox statement:
Thyroglobulin (Tg) determinations can be affected by the presence of Tg autoantibodies
(anti-Tg) in some patient samples. These autoantibodies may interfere with the assay used to
measure Tg, causing false high or false low Tg values.
The measured Tg value of a patient’s sample can also vary depending on the assay used.The
laboratory finding must therefore always contain a statement on the Tg assay method used. Tg
values determined on patient samples by different assays cannot be directly compared with one
another and could be the cause of erroneous medical interpretations. If there is a change in the Tg
assay procedure used while patient monitoring, the Tg values obtained upon changing to the new
procedure must be confirmed by parallel measurements with both methods.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
cobas e 411 analyzer (cleared under K062279)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Materials included in the Elecsys TgII assay
Elecsys Tg II consists of the reagent rack-pack. Each reagent rack-pack is for 100 tests and contains:
• M (6.5 mL): Streptavidin-coated microparticles (transparent cap) 0.72 mg/mL and
preservative.
K221890 - Page 2 of 17

--- Page 3 ---
• R1 (9 mL): Biotinylated monoclonal anti Tg antibody (mouse) (gray cap) 1 mg/L in Bis Tris
buffer 50 mmol/L, pH 6.3 and preservative.
• R2 (9 mL): Monoclonal anti Tg antibodies (mouse) labeled with ruthenium complex (black
cap) 3.1 mg/L in Bis Tris buffer 50 mmol/L, pH 6.3 and preservative.
Materials required (but not supplied)
• Tg II CalSet (4 x 1.0 mL): 2 vials each of Tg at 0.15 ng/mL, and 180 ng/mL
• PreciControl Universal (4 x 3.0 mL): 2 vials each of Tg at 25 ng/mL, and 100 ng/mL
• PreciControl TS (4 x 2.0 mL): 4 vials of 1 ng/mL
• Diluent MultiAssay (2 x 16 mL): sample diluent
• Anti-Tg assay: to verify the presence of antibodies to Tg in patient samples
• Distilled or deionized water
B Principle of Operation:
The Elecsys Tg II assay is a quantitative, two-step, double antigen sandwich assay. In the first
incubation, thyroglobulin (Tg) in the patient sample reacts with a biotinylated monoclonal Tg-
specific antibody and monoclonal Tg-specific antibodies labeled with a ruthenium complex to form a
sandwich complex. After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex bounds to the
solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin in second incubation. The reaction mixture is
aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface
of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell/ProCell M. Application of a
voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a
photomultiplier. Results for the Tg concentration of samples are determined via a calibration curve,
which is instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the
reagent barcode.

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the Elecys Tg II assay was assessed based on CLSI document EP06 2nd
Edition. Linearity series were prepared by mixing High and low native serum samples to
create 13 levels that span across the analytical measuring interval (AMI). Each level was
measured with four replicates using three lots of reagents on the cobas e 411 analyzer. For
each level, the mean value of the measured values, predicted value and the deviation from
linearity were calculated. Predicted values were calculated using a best fitted straight line by
a weighted least squares linear regression analysis. Percent deviations from linearity were
calculated as differences between the observed values (mean values) and the predicted values
divided by the predicted values. The table below summarizes the linearity data analysis:

* % Deviation from Linearity for concentrations ≥0.3 ng/mL
** Deviation (ng/mL) from Linearity for concentrations <0.3 ng/mL
The data support the linearity interval from 0.005 to 578 ng/mL with deviations from
linearity within ±10% for values ≥ 0.3 ng/mL and ±0.03 ng/mL for values < 0.3 ng/mL. The
study results support the linearity of the claimed analytical measuring interval (AMI): 0.1 –
500 ng/mL.
High Dose Hook Effect:
The high-dose hook effect of the Elecsys Tg II assay was assessed using three samples
spiked with purified human Thyroglobulin up to concentrations at 226,021, 229,820, and
244,927 ng/mL. Each sample was diluted with Diluent MultiAssay to produce a set of 11
samples with concentrations spanning between 55.1 and 226,021, 56.1 and 229,820, and 59.8
and 244,927 ng/mL. All samples were tested in singleton using the Elecsys Tg II on one
cobas e 411 analyzer. The hook concentration reported corresponds to the highest analyte
concentration that generates a signal ≥ 10% above the upper limit of the measuring range. No
hook effect was observed for the Elecsys Tg II up to 120,000 ng/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The studies were performed to evaluate potential interference and cross reactivity of the
Elecsys Tg II assay following the CLSI EP07 (3rd Edition) and EP37 (1st Edition) guidelines.
Endogenous Interfering Substances:
Potential endogenous interfering substances were tested for their ability to interfere with the
Elecsys Tg II assay using three serum samples with thyroglobulin concentration around 0.2

ng/mL, 2 ng/mL, and 40 ng/mL. For each interfering substance, test samples were spiked
with the test substance and results were compared to control samples spiked with an equal
volume of solvent. All samples were measured in five replicates using one Elecsys Tg II
assay on one cobas e 411 analyzer. The interference was calculated by comparing the mean
measurements of the test and control samples. No-significant interference (≤ ±10%
difference of test from control) were observed for the Elecsys Tg II up to the following
concentrations for each endogenous substance tested:

Intralipid 2,000 mg/dL
Biotin 1,200 ng/mL
IgG 2 g/dL
Albumin 7 mg/dL
*90% unconjugated + 10% conjugated Bilirubin
Exogenous Interfering Substances:
Potential exogenous interfering substances (drugs) were tested for their ability to interfere
with the Elecsys Tg II assay using three serum samples with thyroglobulin concentrations
around 0.2 ng/mL, 2 ng/mL, and 50 ng/mL. For each interfering substance, test samples were
spiked with the test substance and results were compared to control samples spiked with an
equal volume of solvent (blank). All samples were measured in five replicates using one
Elecsys Tg II assay on one cobas e 411 analyzer. The interference was calculated by
comparing measurements of the test and control samples. No significant interference (≤
±10% difference of test from control) for the Elecsys Tg II was observed up to the following

Cross-reactivity:
Each potential cross-reacting substance was tested with serum samples at two thyroglobulin
concentrations: 5 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL. Test samples were prepared by spiking with the
potential cross-reacting substances. Results were compared to control samples which were
spiked with an equal volume of solvent (blank) where appropriate. All samples were
measured in five replicates using one Elecsys Tg II assay on one cobas e 411 analyzer. The
cross-reactivity was calculated by comparing measurements of the test and control samples.
No significant cross reactivity (≤ ±10% difference of test from control) for the Elecsys Tg II
was observed up to the following concentrations of the potential cross-reacting substances
tested:
Cross-reacting Substance Concentration
Thyroxine Binding Globulin (TBG) 200,000 ng/mL
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) 1,000 mIU/mL)
Blocking Effect of HAMA/Heterophilic Ab:
The effect of the presence of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) on the Elecsys Tg II
assay was assessed on the cobas e 411 analyzer. A serum pool with thyroglobulin
concentration of 7 ng/mL was used to spike in HAMA. The spiked sample and the
corresponding serum pool without HAMA were tested in four replicates. The recovery of the
serum pool containing HAMA compared to the serum pool without HAMA was calculated.
No interference was observed up to 805 μg/L of HAMA.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The analytical measuring interval (AMI) for the Elecsys TgII is 0.1 – 500 ng/mL.
The instrument has a 1:10 auto-dilution feature for the device. The claimed extended
measuring range is from 500 ng/mL to 5,000 ng/mL. Samples with concentrations above
5,000 ng/mL are reported as > 5,000 ng/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The Elecsys Tg II was standardized against the Certified Reference Material (CRM) 457 of
the Community Bureau of Reference of the European Union.
Stability:
Shelf-life stability:
The shelf-life stability of the Elecsys Tg II was conducted. The reagent packs were stored at
2–8oC and the real-time stability was evaluated at baseline and testing timepoints up to 17
months. The data support a shelf-life of the Elecsys Tg II up to 15 months at 2–8oC.

Open-pack reagent stability:
Reagent stability at 2−8oC after first opening for the Elecsys Tg II assay was evaluated on
one cobas e 411 analyzer. A fresh reagent rack pack was placed on the analyzer and
calibrated. Five native single donor serum samples covering the AMI of the assay were tested
at baseline and other time points up to 101 days. The data of each sample at each testing time
point were compared to the data of initial value tested at baseline. The data support the
reagent stability of 84 days at 2–8oC after first opening.
On-board reagent stability:
On-board reagent stability for the Elecsys Tg II was evaluated on one cobas e 411 analyzer.
Five native serum samples covering the AMI of the assay were tested at baseline and other
time points up to 44 days. The data of each sample at each testing time point were compared
to the data of initial value tested at baseline. The data support the claim of 28 days stability
for the Elecsys Tg II reagents stored on-board on the cobas e 411 analyzer.
Calibration stability:
The Elecsys Tg II was calibrated with a fresh reagent kit on Day 0 using one cobas e 411
analyzer. Five native serum samples covering the AMI of the assay were tested up to 29
days. On each testing day, a new reagent kit of the same lot stored at 2–8oC was used, and
recovery of samples was determined using the calibration curve of day 0. The data support
the claim of 28 days calibration stability on the cobas e 411.
On-board calibration stability:
On-board calibration stability for the Elecsys Tg II assay was evaluated on one cobas e 411
immunoassay analyzer. A fresh Elecsys Tg II reagent rack pack was placed on the analyzer.
Five serum samples covering the AMI of the assay were tested at baseline and other time
points up to 22 days. After specific time point, the same samples were measured using a
separate Elecsys Tg II reagent kit kept under on-board condition (20 ± 3°C) without re-
calibration of the reagent kit. The data support the claim of 7 days for the on-board
calibration stability on the cobas e 411.
Sample stability:
The sample stability of serum, Li-Heparin plasma, K2-EDTA and K3-EDTA plasma was
evaluated using samples stored at 2–8°C, 15–25°C, and -20°C (±5°C) (-25 to -15°C) for each
sample matrix. Seven samples were prepared covering the AMI of the assay and tested using
the Elecsys Tg II on the cobas e 411 analyzer at Day 0 and at various testing timepoints
during storage: 2–8°C and 15–25°C up to 15 days, and -20°C (±5°C) up to 41 months. At
each testing point, measurements were performed in three replicates and recovery was
calculated as percent or absolute deviation compared to the values of Day 0. The data support
the stability for all sample types for 14 days at 2−8°C, 14 days at 15−25°C, and 24 months at
-20 (± 5)°C.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for
Elecsys Tg II reagent pack were determined based on the CLSI EP17-A2 guidelines.
K221890 - Page 10 of 17

--- Page 11 ---
LoB:
The LoB was determined by testing five analyte-free serum samples with at least two Elecsys
Tg II reagent lots on one cobas e 411 analyzer. Samples were tested in two replicates per run,
two runs per day for two days, and one run per day for another two days, for a toal of 60
measurements per reaget lot. LoB was defined as the value corresponding to the 95th
percentile of the rank position of the distribution of values. The highest LoB value observed
across tested reagent lots was 0.017 ng/mL. The claimed LoD for the Elecsys Tg II is 0.02
ng/mL.
LoD:
The LoD was determined by testing five serum samples containing low levels of
thyroglobulin with three reagent lots on one cobas e 411 analyzer. Samples were run in two
replicates per run, two runs per day for two days, and one run per day for another two days,
yielding a total of 60 measurements per lot. The LoD was calculated LoD was calculated
based on LoD = LoB + 1.653 x SD (total of low analyte samples). The highest LoD value
observed across three lots was 0.04 ng/mL. The claimed LoD for Elecsys Tg II test is 0.04
ng/mL.
LoQ:
The LoQ was determined by testing a set of seven low level of serum samples using three
reagent lots on one cobas e 411 analyzer. The samples were analyzed in five replicates on
one cobas e 411 analyzer, one run per day over five days, for a total of N=25 determinations
per sample per reagent lot. The LoQ was determined to be the lowest analyte concentration
that measured with a %CV of within-laboratory precision ≤ 20% and %bias within ±15%.
The highest LoQ value observed across lots was 0.057 ng/mL. The claimed LoQ for Elecsys
Tg II test is 0.1 ng/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
See Clinical Cut-Off below.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison study were conducted by testing 141 native serum samples in singleton
at one clinical site using one reagent lot of Elecsys Tg II (candidate device) on cobas e 411
analyzer, and one reagent lot of Access Thyroglobulin assay (predicate device) on Beckman
Access DxI 800. Among 141 samples, 126 samples had values within the measuring ranges
of both candidate and predicate devices and analyzed with Passing-Bablok regression. The
results showed a slope of 1.394 with an intercept of -0.102. Such results indicated a
systematic difference between the candidate and predicate devices. Therefore, in addition to
the method comparison study, the recovery study was conducted as follows:
The recovery study used the master calibrator material traceable to the Certified Reference
Material (CRM) for spiking into the Diluent MultiAssay (sample diluent used for the Elecsys
Tg II). A dilution series including 17 samples were prepared by diluting the sample with
value of 557 ng/mL with Diluent MultiAssay. Samples with spiked values from 1 ng/mL to
K221890 - Page 11 of 17

--- Page 12 ---
557 ng/mL were measured in four replicates and samples with spiked values from 0.0557
ng/mL to 0.195 ng/mL were measured in 10 replicates. All measurements were performed
using one Elecsys Tg II reagent lot on one cobas e 411 analyzer. The mean-value of
replicates for each sample level was compared to its expected concentration level, and the
percent recovery (% recovery) was calculated. The results showed that the % recovery for 17
samples is from 91.7% to 110.5%.
2. Matrix Comparison:
A study was performed to demonstrate that lithium heparin, K2-EDTA, and K3-EDTA
plasma matrices yield comparable values as serum with the Elecsys Tg II. The study included
65 matched native single and pooled samples with thyroglobulin concentration covering the
measuring range of the assay. Samples were tested in singleton using one reagent lot on
cobas e 401. Passing-Bablok regression analyses were performed by comparing the results of
samples from different plasma samples (y) to the results of corresponding serum samples (x)
for two different ranges of the serum sample concentrations (0.197 to 19.9 ng/mL and 20 to
490 ng/mL). The results are summarized in the tables below:

C Clinical Studies:
The effectiveness of the Elecsys Tg II assay as an aid in monitoring of disease status in patients
who have differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and have had thyroid surgery (with or without
ablative therapy) was determined from a prospective, multi-center study. The clinical
performance of the Elecsys Tg II at a cut-off of 0.2 ng/mL was evaluated by comparing the test
results with the clinical status, the presence of structural disease (SD) over a 24-month period
after surgery in subjects with a diagnosis of DTC based on an estimated real-world structural
disease prevalence. The clinical study consists of two sets of patients: longitudinal cohort and
cross-sectional cohort.
Subject inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows:
Inclusion criteria:
• Subject ≥ 22 years of age at the time of enrollment
• Subject able and willing to provide informed consent
• Histologically confirmed and documented papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma,
including Hurthle and follicular variants of papillary carcinoma
For Longitudinal Cohort

– 12 weeks prior to enrollment
• Subjects who have a total/near total thyroidectomy as a result of a completion
thyroidectomy following lobectomy and who meet all other entry requirements may be
enrolled once at least 4 weeks have elapsed following the completion surgery
• Subject willing and able to tolerate removal of up to 20 mL of blood per visit
For Cross-sectional cohort
• Subject diagnosed with DTC and has undergone total/near total thyroidectomy > 12
weeks prior to enrollment with current evidence of structural disease

or secretion or any other substance known to interfere directly or indirectly with Tg
synthesis or secretion within the last 3 months (90 days) before enrollment, if applicable.
From nine different sites in U.S., a total of 772 samples from 219 subjects were collected for
longitudinal cohort (Group 1) and a total of 72 samples from 72 subjects were collected from
cross-sectional cohort (Group 2). Among them, 242 samples were excluded (due to subject

discontinuation or other reasons) and therefore, a total of 530 samples including 461 samples in
Group 1 and 69 samples in Group 2 were used in the study analysis.
For the samples of 530 evaluated in the study, the distributions of demographic and clinical
variables are described in the table below:

For the Group 1 longitudinal cohort, serum samples were collected from subjects within 4 – 12
weeks following total or near total thyroidectomy but before radioiodine ablation (if planned).
Thyroglobulin levels were measured at four additional time points (approximately 6 months, 12
months, 18 months, and 24 months post-surgery/radioiodine ablation) resulting in five planned
visits per patient. For the Group 2 cross-sectional cohort, samples from subjects had only one
single visit. All samples were tested with the Elecsys Tg II on cobas e 411 analyzer.
For each sample at each visit, structural disease (SD+) was defined as evidence of disease on
ultrasound, cross-sectional or functional imaging, or biopsy proven disease as determined by the
investigator.
Results:
In this study, samples from the cross-sectional cohort (Group 2) were used to increase the
number of observations from the patients with structural disease due to the low prevalence of
structural disease in the longitudinal cohort. This increased number of observations from patients

with structural disease provides estimations of sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV)
with less uncertainty. Because the longitudinal and the cross-sectional cohorts were combined,
the prevalence of structural disease was larger than the real-life prevalence, the estimates of NPV
and positive predictive value (PPV) were adjusted using the real-world prevalence of structural
disease observed in the longitudinal cohort (4.99 % = 23/461).
The following tables represent the combined data from two groups and the clinical performance:

*The confidence intervals for the LR were calculated as confidence intervals for the ratios of two
independent binomial proportions by the asymptotic method.
In 491 samples in the longitudinal study, 49 samples were from RAI-treated patients and 412
samples were from Not-RAI-treated patients. The prevalence of SD+ based on this study cohort
was determined as: 10.20% (5/49) for RAI-treated patients and 4.37% (18/412) for Not-RAI-
treated patients. The probability of SD+ for three ranges of the Elecsys Tg II described above is
presented in the table below for RAI-treated and Not RAI-treated patients separately and these
probabilities were adjusted for the SD+ real-world prevalence of 10.20% for RAI-treated and
4.37% for Not RAI-treated patients separately [PV probability of SD+ then PV/(1-
PV)=LR*prevalence/(1-prevalence)].

The results from the clinical study demonstrated that at Tg concentrations ≥ 1.0 ng/mL
(corresponding to ATA “Biochemical Incomplete Response”), the probability of structural
disease (i.e., 45% for RAI-treated patients and 22% for Not RAI-treated patients) was much
higher than the probability of structural disease for Tg concentrations <0.2 ng/mL
(corresponding to ATA “Excellent Response”).
D Clinical Cut-Off:
The clinical cut-off for the Elecsys Tg II is 0.2 ng/mL. This was set based on 2015 ATA
Guidelines which introduced an “Excellent response” with “no clinical, biochemical or structural
evidence of disease” and for patients without TSH stimulation is defined by negative imaging
and a suppressed Tg < 0.2 ng/mL in the absence of Tg antibodies. Tg ≥ 0.2 AND Tg < 1.0 was
used corresponding to the ATA response to therapy classification to determine “Indeterminate
Response.” Tg > 1.0 ng/mL was used corresponding to the ATA response to therapy
classification to determine “Biochemical Incomplete Response.”
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A reference range of the Elecsys Tg II was established by testing serum samples from a total of
463 apparently healthy individuals including 244 males and 219 females. The results are
summarized in the following table:

Addtionally, the value of the Elecsys Tg II was evaluated in a total of 127 subjects with
differentiated thyroid cancer with no evidence of disease for 4 or more years following
total/near-total thyroidectomy. The study included 100 female patients aged 26 to 92 years, and
27 male patients aged 34 to 81 years. The results showed that the thyroglobulin concentration
ranged 0.1 to 11.6 ng/mL. About 80.3% (102/127) of subjects had thyroglobulin level below 0.1
ng/mL, and 95% of patients had thyroglobulin level ≤ 0.786 ng/mL.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
