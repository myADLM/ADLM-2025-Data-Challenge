IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer System is a small automatic blood gas analyzer for
laboratory and point of care settings. It consists of the analyzer, sensor cartridges, calibrator
packs, auto-cartridge quality control packs (internal controls), ampuled quality control materials
(external controls) and thermal paper for an onboard printer. Specimens may be identified by
scanning a barcode or by manually entering the information via the touchscreen.
The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer was previously cleared for use by healthcare professionals
in clinical laboratory settings and for point-of-care usage for quantitative determination of pH,
pCO2, pO2, Hematocrit, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Ionized Calcium, Ionized Magnesium,

Glucose, Lactate, Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Oxygen Saturation, Total Hemoglobin,
Oxyhemoglobin, Carboxyhemoglobin, Methemoglobin, and Deoxyhemoglobin in heparinized
arterial and venous whole blood. Those claims have not changed. In this submission, the use by
healthcare professionals in clinical laboratory settings and for point-of-care usage for
quantitative determination of pH, Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide (pCO2), Partial Pressure of
Oxygen (pO2), Hematocrit, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Ionized Calcium, Ionized Magnesium,
Glucose, and Lactate in heparinized capillary whole blood is being added.
The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer has slots to accommodate two sensor cartridges (Primary
and Auxiliary). The analyzer will determine the configuration of the system by detecting which
sensor cards are installed. The reporting of CO-Oximeter parameters (or not reporting them) are
determined by the selection of the Sensor Cards, for which there are two options:
• Primary Sensor Card 1 reports the following analytes: pO2, pCO2, pH, Hct, tHb, Na, Cl, K,
iCa, iMg, Glu, SO2, O2Hb, COHb, MetHb, HHb, tBil, HbF
• Primary Sensor Card 2 reports the following analytes: pO2, pCO2, pH, Hct, tHb, Na, Cl, K,
iCa, iMg, Glu, SO2
Auxiliary Sensor Card Port:
The reporting of Creatinine and BUN parameters (or not reporting them) is determined by the
selection of the Auxiliary Sensor Card
• Auxiliary Sensor Card 1 enables Creatinine and BUN parameters
• Auxiliary Sensor Card 2 is a “dummy” sensor card and does not report any parameters.
The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer is a blood gas, co-oximetry, electrolyte, chemistry, and
hematology analyzer with an enhanced test menu and multiple quality control options. Both
traditional internal and external quality control is available, as well as an on-board Quality
Management System (QMS), and an electronic monitoring approach to ensure the analyzer is
working properly at all times. The Stat Profile Prime Plus Analyzer accepts samples from
syringes, open blood collection tubes, and capillary tubes. The end user selects which analytes
are to be tested from the test menu on the analyzer display screen.
B Principle of Operation:
pH is measured using a hydrogen ion selective glass membrane. One side of the glass is in
contact with a solution of constant pH. The other side is in contact with a solution of unknown
pH. A change in potential develops which is proportional to the pH difference of these solutions.
This change in potential is measured against a reference electrode of constant potential. The
magnitude of the potential difference is a measure, then, of the pH of the unknown solution.
pCO2 is measured with a modified pH sensor. Carbon dioxide in the unknown solution makes
contact with a gas permeable membrane mounted on a combination measuring/ reference
electrode. CO diffuses across the membrane into a thin layer of electrolyte solution in response
2
to partial pressure difference. This solution then becomes equilibrated with the external gas
pressure. CO in the solution becomes hydrated producing carbonic acid, which results in a
2
change in hydrogen ion activity.
K221900 - Page 4 of 15

--- Page 5 ---
pO2 is measured amperometrically by the generation of a current at the sensor surface. As
oxygen diffuses through a gas permeable membrane, the oxygen molecules are reduced at the
cathode, consuming 4 electrons for every molecule of oxygen reduced. This flow of electrons is
then measured by the sensor and is directly proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen.
Hematocrit is defined as the percentage of red blood cells to the total blood volume and can be
obtained by measuring electrical resistance of the blood sample. Two standard solutions are used
to calibrate the hematocrit sensor and to obtain the slope. The analyzer then measures the
electrical resistance of the blood sample to obtain the hematocrit value. The hematocrit value
obtained is corrected for the concentration of the sodium ion.
Glucose measurement is based on the level of H O produced during the enzymatic reaction
2 2
between glucose and oxygen molecules in the presence of the glucose oxidase enzyme. At a
constant potential of 0.70 volts, electroactive H O is oxidized at the surface of the platinum
2 2
anode. The current generated by the flow of electrons at the surface of the platinum electrode is
proportional to the glucose concentration of the sample.
Lactate measurement is based on the level of H O produced during the enzymatic reaction
2 2
between lactate and oxygen molecules in the presence of the lactate oxidase enzyme. At a
constant potential of 0.70 volts, electroactive H O is oxidized at the surface of the platinum
2 2
anode. The current generated by the flow of electrons at the surface of the platinum electrode is
proportional to the lactate concentration of the sample.
Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Ionized Calcium, Ionized Magnesium: The parameters are
measured by an Ion-Selective Electrode (ISE) that selectively measures the activity of ionic
species. When the ISE is contacted with a sample, potential is developed. The potential is
proportional to the logarithm of the ionic activity and is measured versus a reference electrode.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:

4. Calibration:
The Stat Profile Prime Plus analyzer utilizes a replaceable internal Calibrator Cartridge to
calibrate the Blood Gas, Electrolyte, Metabolite and CO-Ox sensors contained in the
analyzer. Calibrations are initiated by the analyzer automatically but can also be started
manually if necessary.
5. Quality Control:
The Stat Profile Prime Plus Blood Gas/CO-Oximeter Controls 1, 2, and 3 and Nova Prime
Plus Chemistry Controls Levels 4, 5 are quality control material recommended for

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study for capillary whole blood was performed at two external POC
sites with 5 POC operators at site 1 and 4 POC operators at site 2 over a minimum of 20
days. Capillary blood samples were collected via finger-stick and analyzed in singlet on the
Stat Profile Prime Plus in capillary mode and on the Stat Profile pHOx Ultra in capillary
mode. Stat Profile Prime Plus test results were compared to the Stat Profile pHOx Ultra test
results for each parameter. To span the reportable range for each analyte, <10% of total
samples were contrived, transferred into capillary tubes and run in singlicate on the Stat
Profile Prime Plus and Stat Profile pHOx Ultra. A least squares linear regression analysis of
the samples was performed for contrived and native sample combined and native samples
only. The results from both sites were similar and combined results are shown below for
native and contrived samples.
