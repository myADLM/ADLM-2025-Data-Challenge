B Principle of Operation:
The Access Total βhCG (5th IS) assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”)
assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel along with citrate buffer. After an initial incubation,
rabbit anti-βhCG alkaline phosphatase conjugate and paramagnetic particles coated with goat
anti-mouse IgG: mouse monoclonal anti-βhCG complexes are added. The hCG binds to the
immobilized monoclonal anti-βhCG on the solid phase while, at the same time, the rabbit anti-
βhCG alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts with different antigenic sites on the hCG.
After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light
generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly
proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically
determined from a stored calibration.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted to estimate repeatability and within-laboratory precision.
The study was run on three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzers and three reagent pack lots.
Seven serum samples with approximate hCG concentrations of 0.5, 7, 25, 100, 800, 1,000
and 120,000 mIU/mL were used in the determination of imprecision. Each sample was
assayed in duplicate, in two runs per day, over twenty days for a total of 40 runs and 80
replicates per instrument. Each instrument was evaluated with one reagent lot. The within-
run, between-run, between-day, and total imprecision was calculated. Results from multiple
lots were similar. Results from one representative lot are provided in the table below:

A reproducibility study was conducted to assess instrument-to-instrument variability. Five
serum samples with different hCG concentrations were run on three DxI 9000 Immunoassay
Analyzers. The samples were tested across three reagent lots and one calibrator lot on each
instrument with five replicates per run and one run per day over five days. The within-run,
between-day, between-instrument, and reproducibility was calculated for each reagent lot.
Results from multiple lots were similar. Results from one representative lot are provided
below:

2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated based upon recommendations in CLSI EP06-Ed2. Seven sample
dilutions at concentrations across the measuring range of the Access Total βhCG (5th IS)
(0.07 to approximately 1598.5 mIU/mL) were prepared by mixing different proportions of a
serum sample containing high concentrations of βhCG and a serum samples containing low
concentrations of βhCG. The low concentration serum sample was run in eight replicates,
and all other samples were run in replicates of four. This study was run on one DxI 9000
Immunoassay System, using three reagent lots and one calibrator lot. Three quality controls
were run in replicates of two to verify the system was in control. The data was analyzed
using a weighted linear regression model as described in the guideline. The results from the
linearity study supports the sponsor’s claimed analytical measuring interval of 0.6 to
approximately 1350 mIU/mL. The maximum deviation from linearity was found to be
acceptable and supported by the results.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Potential cross-reactivity, interference, and high dose effect were evaluated in k130020. No
cross reactivity, interference, or high dose effect was observed.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay reportable range is 0.6 – 1350 mIU/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
This assay is traceable to the WHO 5th International Standard for human Chorionic
Gonadotropin (NIBSC Code 07/364).
6. Detection Limit:
The LoB, LoD, LoQ were determined based upon recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.
Limit of blank (LoB) is the highest concentration that is likely to be observed for a blank
sample. To calculate the LoB, three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Systems were used with three
reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. Four S0 (hCG free)calibrator lots were used for the

LoB determination. Samples were tested over three days one run per day, five replicates per
run, for each reagent pack lot. Three quality controls were run in duplicate on each day.. LoB
was determined using the 95% nonparametric percentile of the replicates for each of three
reagent lots. The LoB was determined to be 0.1 mIU/mL.
Limit of detection (LoD) is the lowest concentration of analyte that can be detected reliably.
To calculate the LoD, three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Systems were used with three reagent
lots and one calibrator lot. Seven serum samples containing low levels of total βhCG (5th IS)
analyte were prepared. Samples were tested in nine replicates per day over five days for each
reagent pack lot. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day.. The LoD
was determined to be 0.2 mIU/mL.
Limit of quantitation (LoQ) is the lowest concentration which is the design requirements of
TEa% (Total Error Allowance) of ≤30%. To calculate LoQ, three DxI 9000 Immunoassay
Systems were used with three reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. Thirteen native
serum samples containing low levels of total βhCG analyte were prepared. Each of the
samples were run in replicates of nine, in one run per day, for five days on three reagent
pack lots (45 replicates of each sample on each reagent lot). Three quality controls were run
in replicates of two on each day to verify the systems were in control. The LoQ was
determined to be 0.6 mIU/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed comparing the Access Total βhCG (5th IS) assay
on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer to the comparator device, the Access Total
βhCG (5th IS) assay run on the Access 2 Immunoassay System using a protocol based on
CLSI EP09c-A3. A total of one hundred eleven (111) human serum samples were run on
three DxI 9000 instruments and three Access 2 instruments with three reagent pack lots and
three calibrator lots. Three commercial quality controls were run in triplicate each day. The
