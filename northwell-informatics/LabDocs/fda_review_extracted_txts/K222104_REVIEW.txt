III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Atellica® CH Diazo Total Bilirubin (D_TBil) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the
quantitative determination of total bilirubin in adults and children (non-neonates) in human
serum and plasma using the Atellica® CH Analyzer. Measurement of total bilirubin, an organic
compound formed during the normal and abnormal destruction of red blood cells, is used in the
diagnosis and treatment of liver, hemolytic, hematological, and metabolic disorders, including
hepatitis and gall bladder block.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Atellica CH Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
.
The Atellica® CH Diazo Total Bilirubin (D_TBil) assay consists of the following 2 packs:
Pack 1 (P1) 23.5 mL Phosphate buffer (50mmol/L);
NaCl (150mmol/L)
Pack 2 (P2) 8.8ml 2,4-Dicholoroaniline (5mmol/L);
HCl (130mmol/L);
Na-Nitrite (0.5mmol/L)
Materials required but not provided: Atellica CH Bilirubin Calibrator (BILI CAL).
B Principle of Operation:
The Atellica® CH Diazo Total Bilirubin (D_TBil) is an assay that uses 2,4-dichloroaniline
(DCA). Direct bilirubin in the presence of diazotized DCA forms a red-colored azocompound in
acidic solution that can be measured. A specific mixture of detergents enables the determination
of total bilirubin. The detection wavelength is 545nm.
This assay requires 6.0 µL of sample for a single determination.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision
Precision studies were conducted according to CLSI EP05-A3. Total precision was assessed in 2
runs (minimum 2 hours between each run), 2 replicates per run per day, over 20 days, for a total
of 80 results per sample. Three spiked serum samples were tested using 3 reagent lots on one
Atellica CH Analyzer. Repeatability and within-lab imprecision were calculated. Results were
similar between reagent lots. The precision data from a representative reagent lot are summarized
below.

Serum 1 1.02 0.015 1.5 0.034 3.3
Serum 2 13.40 0.053 0.4 0.140 1.0
Serum 3 22.39 0.067 0.3 0.189 0.8
Reproducibility
Testing was conducted according to CLSI EP05-A3. Reproducibility was assessed using 3 serum
pool samples measured in 5 replicates, using 3 reagent lots, over 5 days, on 3 Atellica CH
Analyzers, for a total of 225 replicates per sample. Repeatability, between-day, between-lot,

2. Linearity:
Linearity studies were conducted according to CLSI-EP06 2nd Edition. A dilution series
composed of 9 levels (0.04 - 27.91 mg/dL) was prepared by mixing different proportions of
the high serum pool sample and the low serum pool sample. Four replicates for each sample
were measured on the Atellica CH Analyzer using 3 reagent lots. The data was analyzed
using a linear regression model as described in the guideline. The results support the claimed
measuring range of 0.10 mg/dL – 25.0 mg/dL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were conducted according to the CLSI EP07 3rd Edition guideline. The
effect of endogenous and exogenous substances on the D_TBil assay was evaluated using
two human serum pools spiked to obtain bilirubin concentrations of ~1.0 mg/dL or ~14.0
mg/dL. Each sample was tested in 5 replicates. Testing used the paired-difference method of
comparing a sample spiked with interferent to a sample spiked with control material (diluent
used in the test sample). The sponsor considered interference to be non-significant if the
difference between the samples with and without interferent are within 10.0%. The results of
the interference studies are summarized below.
Interferent Highest interferent concentration tested
that showed no significant interference
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL
Triglyceride 1000 mg/dL
Acetaminophen 20 mg/dL
Acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/dL

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay measuring interval is 0.10 to 25.00 mg/dL.
The sponsor provided data to support that the measuring interval can be extended up to 50.00
mg/dL following manual or automated dilution.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The assay is traceable to SRM916 (NIST) Standard Reference Material.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
validated based on the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
To calculate the LoB, four blank samples in replicates of five were tested using three reagent
lots on one Atellica CH Analyzer over three days for a total of 60 measurements per reagent
lot. LoB was determined using the 95% nonparametric percentile of the replicates for each of
three reagent lots. The claimed LoB is 0.01 mg/dL.
To calculate the LoD, two low native serum samples and two samples prepared from diluted
serum pools were tested in replicates of five on one Atellica CH Analyzer using three reagent
lots over three days for a total of 60 measurements per lot. The maximum observed LoD
across the 3 lots tested was 0.02 mg/dL. The claimed LoD is 0.02 mg/dL.
To calculate the LoQ, five low level total bilirubin sample pools targeted between 0.03
mg/dL and 0.17 mg/dL were tested in replicates of five on one Atellica CH Analyzer using
three reagent lots over five days for a total of 125 determinations per lot. The maximum
observed LoQ across all reagent lots was determined to be 0.04 mg/dL. The claimed LoQ is
0.1 mg/dL which is the lowest concentration that met the performance goal of less than 20%
CV.

A method comparison study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP09c-A3 using 103
serum samples with 3 reagent lots on one Atellica CH Analyzer. Each serum sample was
tested in duplicate. Results from the Atellica CH Diazo Total Bilirubin assay were compared
to results using the predicate device. Results were analyzed using Deming regression. Only
the first replicate result was used in the statistical analysis.
The table below summarizes the data using serum samples from a representative lot:

Fifty-seven (57) matched serum and plasma (lithium heparin, sodium heparin, dipotassium
EDTA) samples were assayed with one Atellica CH Analyzer in singlicate. Results were
analyzed using Deming regression.
The table below summarizes the matrix comparison data:
