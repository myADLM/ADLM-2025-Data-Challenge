The Atellica® IM Multi‑Diluent 15 ReadyPack ancillary reagent pack consists of 25.0 mL/pack
of Equine serum; sodium azide (0.1%); preservatives
The Atellica® IM TSH3-UL CAL (calibrator) consists of 2.0 mL/vial; buffer; equine serum;
sodium azide (< 0.1%); preservatives
Atellica® CH Albumin BCP (AlbP)
The Atellica® CH Albumin BCP (AlbP) assay, also referred to as the Atellica® CH AlbP, is an
assay system performed using the Atellica® CH AlbP Reagent Pack and the Atellica® CH AlbP
CAL (calibrator) on the Atellica® CI Analyzer.
The Atellica® CH AlbP Reagent Pack consists of two wells of reagent 1: 18.3 mL Bromocresol
Purple (1.1 mmol/L), acetate buffer, surfactant, microbial inhibitor. Materials required, but not
provided, consist of the Atellica® CH AlbP CAL (calibrator).
Principle of Operation:
Atellica® IM TSH3-UL assay
The Atellica® IM TSH3-UL assay employs anti-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) monoclonal
antibody covalently bound to paramagnetic particles, a FITC-labeled anti-TSH capture mouse
monoclonal antibody, and a tracer consisting of a proprietary acridinium ester and an anti-TSH
mouse monoclonal antibody conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) for chemiluminescent
detection. A direct relationship exists between the amount of TSH present in the patient sample,
with a sample volume of 75 μL, and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the
system.
Atellica® CH AlbP assay
The Atellica® CH AlbP assay employs photometric determination to measure albumin. Albumin
binds to bromocresol purple (BCP) dye in mildly acidic pH to form an albumin-BCP complex.
An increase in absorbance at 596/694 nm is proportional to the concentration of albumin in the
sample, when a sample volume of 4 μL is tested.
B Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Atellica® CI Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
The specimen is held in a tube with a barcode label. The system identifies the specimen by
scanning the barcode. This is the primary use case for sample identification. The system also
3

supports manual entry of sample IDs to support the needs of the customer and the use of a
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
For CH assays, the sample volume on the Atellica® CI Analyzer is 4–50μL. For IM assays,
the sample volume on the Atellica® CI Analyzer is 10–100 μL.
Specimen sampling and handling procedures are analyte specific and documented in the
respective reagent method sheets.
4. Calibration:
Calibration methods and procedures are analyte specific and documented in the respective
reagent method sheets.
5. Quality Control:
Labeling recommends that at least two levels (ex: low and high) of an appropriate quality
control material be tested. Quality control procedures are analyte specific and documented in
the respective reagent method sheets.

2. Linearity:
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone:
A high TSH serum pool was created using native samples with known high TSH values. The
high TSH serum pool was serially diluted with a low sample TSH pool (i.e. TSH-free serum
sample) to create 14 TSH serum samples distributed across the analytical measuring interval.
All samples were run in quintuplet on one Atellica® CH Analyzer, with 3 reagent lots. The
results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring interval of 0.008 μIU/mL to
150.000 μIU/mL.
Dilution Recovery:
Studies were conducted in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP34. The dilution study
results support the sponsor’s labeling claims that samples with TSH concentrations above the
150 μIU/mL may be diluted automatically by the analyzer (i.e. 1:2 and 1:5) with a sample
volume of 100 μL and 80 μL, respectively for serum and plasma samples.
Albumin:
A high serum pool was created by spiking native samples with albumin (bovine serum
albumin powder from Sigma Aldrich). The low albumin serum pool was created by diluting
serum samples with CH diluent. The high serum pool was diluted with the low serum pool to
create nine albumin serum samples distributed across the analytical measuring interval. All
samples were run in quintuplet on one Atellica® CI Analyzer, with one reagent lot. The
results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring interval of 0.5 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference testing was conducted in accordance with CLSI guideline EP07‑ed3.
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone:
Two human serum specimen pools with native analyte, concentrations of approximately 0.8
and 9.0 μIU/mL, were supplemented with potentially interfering compounds at levels listed
in the table below. Significant interference was defined as more than ±10% bias as compared
to the control results. The results of the interference study are summarized in the table
below:

i. Patient samples may contain heterophilic antibodies that could react in immunoassays
to give falsely elevated or depressed results. This assay is designed to minimize
interference from heterophilic antibodies.
ii. Do not use samples that contain fluorescein. Fluorescein levels > 0.24 μg/mL may
decrease results in this assay. Evidence suggests that patients undergoing retinal
fluorescein angiography can retain amounts of fluorescein in the body for up to 48–72
hours post-treatment.
In the cases of patients with renal insufficiency, including many diabetics, retention
could be much longer. Such samples can produce falsely depressed values when tested
with this assay and should not be tested. Testing of samples spiked with a theoretical
maximum level of fluorescein (250 μg/mL) used in these patients have resulted in
TSH levels < 0.06 μIU/mL instead of the true value of 27.99 μIU/mL.
iii. As with any immuno-recognition measurement of a peptide, extremely rare genetic
variants of TSH may exhibit varying degrees of detection in this assay.
Cross-Reactivity Testing:
Cross-reactivity studies were performed to evaluate the susceptibility of the Atellica® IM
TSH3-UL assay to cross-reactivity with the following endogenous structural analogs to
human TSH: human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), human luteinizing hormone (LH),

High Dose Hook Effect:
The high-dose hook effect of the Atellica® IM TSH3-UL assay on the Atellica® CI
Analyzer was assessed by testing 15 serial dilutions of human TSH, ≥95% pure,
reconstituted in horse serum. Each sample was tested in replicates of three. No high dose
hook effect was observed for samples containing approximately 3,000 μIU/mL of TSH.
The sponsor includes the following statement in the Atellica® IM TSH3-UL assay package
insert: “High TSH concentrations can cause a paradoxical decrease in the RLUs (high-dose
hook effect). In this assay, patient samples with TSH concentrations as high as 3000 μIU/mL
(mIU/L) will report > 150.000 μIU/mL (mIU/L).”
Albumin:
Two pools of serum samples (~3.5 g/dL and ~5.0 g/dL) were spiked with interfering
substances and tested in quintuplet with 3 reagent lots on one Atellica® CI Analyzer.
Interference was determined by testing controls (no interfering substance added) and
matched test sample (with interfering substance added). Significant interference was
defined as more than ±10% bias as compared to the control results. The results of the
interference study are summarized in the table below:
