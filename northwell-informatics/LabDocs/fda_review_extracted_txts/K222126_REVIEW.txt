IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VivaChek™ Fad Blood Glucose Monitoring System, the VivaChek™ Fad Smart Blood
Glucose Monitoring System, and the VivaChek™ Fad Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System
share the same device technology and the same intended use. Each of the device systems is
comprised of a VivaChek™ Fad Blood Glucose Meter (Fad, Fad Smart, or Fad Sync,
respectively) and VivaChek™ Fad Blood Glucose Test Strips (sold separately). The device
systems differ in minor design features and certain user functions. The VivaChek™ Fad Blood
Glucose Monitoring System contains a user-replaceable single 3.0V CR 2032 coin battery and a
strip ejector button. The VivaChek TM Fad Smart and VivaChek TM Fad Sync Blood Glucose
Monitoring Systems contain a non-serviceable rechargeable 3.7 Volt lithium ion battery, a micro
USB port for recharging, and have minor differences in exterior meter materials and color.
The following items are compatible with the device systems but are not included with the
purchase of the meter and are available for purchase separately:
• VivaChek™ Fad Control Solutions (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3)
• VivaChek™ Lancing Device and VivaChek™ Lancets (k220475).
B Principle of Operation:
The VivaChek™ Fad, VivaChek™ Fad Smart and VivaChek™ Fad Sync Blood Glucose
Monitoring Systems are designed to quantitatively measure the glucose concentration in fresh
capillary whole blood. The blood sample is pulled into the tip of the test strip through capillary
action. The glucose measurement is based amperometry achieved through the electrical current
caused by the reaction of the glucose with glucose dehydrogenase and a mediator of the test
strip, producing a current that positively correlates to the glucose concentration in the blood
sample. The system is calibrated to display plasma equivalent results. After the reaction time, the
glucose concentration in the sample is displayed on the meter.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted with 11 venous whole blood glucose concentration levels
(20, 78, 136, 194, 252, 310, 368, 426, 484, 542, and 600 mg/dL) as determined by the
comparative method (YSI 2300 STAT PLUS Glucose and L-Lactate Analyzer). The results
from the VivaChek™ Fad meter were compared with the values obtained from the
comparator method. The results from the regression analysis are summarized below:
Test Strip Lot # Slope y-intercept R2-value
Lot 1 0.9902 0.9574 0.9985
Lot 2 0.9954 0.4356 0.9989
Lot 3 0.9986 0.2892 0.9988
Combined 0.9947 0.5607 0.9987
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to
600 mg/dL. If a sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as “LO”. If a
sample result is more than 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as “HI”. The low
and high functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed to evaluate the effect of endogenous substances and
common exogenous substances expected in the intended use population. The study was
conducted using venous whole blood samples adjusted to 3 glucose levels (60, 120, and 250
mg/dL) as measured by the comparative method (YSI 2300 STAT PLUS Glucose and L-
Lactate Analyzer). The adjusted blood glucose concentrations were separated into a control
sample with no interferent added and a test sample containing one of 32 potentially
interfering substances. The VivaChek™ Fad meter measurements were averaged and the bias
between the test samples and the control samples was calculated. The highest concentrations
at which no significant interference (defined by the sponsor as bias vs. control being greater
than ± 4.8 mg/dL at < 75 mg/dL and ± 8 % at > 75 mg/dL) effect was observed are presented
in the table below:

Method Comparison/Lay User Performance Study
To assess the performance in the hands of the intended users, the sponsor performed two
independent lay user performance studies with either the VivaChek™ Fad Blood Glucose
Monitoring System or the VivaChek™ Fad Smart Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The
VivaChek™ Fad Sync Blood Glucose Meter is similar in form and function to the
VivaChek™ Fad Smart Blood Glucose Meter (as described above in section IV). Therefore,
the lay user performance study for the VivaChek™ Fad Smart meter is applicable to the
VivaChek™ Fad Sync meter.
The performance of the VivaChek™ Fad Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated
in the hands of 567 intended users at 3 study sites. The performance of the VivaChek™ Fad
Smart Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated in the hands of 353 intended users at
3 study sites. The participants in both studies were provided with the device labeling in
English, collected their own fingertip capillary sample, and performed a blood glucose
measurement without additional training. The blood glucose results obtained by lay users
were compared against the results obtained with a laboratory-based comparative method
(YSI 2300 STAT PLUS Glucose and L-Lactate Analyzer).

Usability
At the end of the lay-user studies, each participant was asked to complete a usability
questionnaire regarding ease of understanding of information in the user manual and the ease
of use when performing a blood glucose test. From the sponsor’s analysis of the
questionnaire responses, the participants were satisfied with the ease of operation following
the instructions for use in the labeling and with their overall ability to conduct testing with
the candidate device.
Readability
The results Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment demonstrated that the User Manual and the
test strip package insert were written at an 8th grade level or less.
Accuracy at Extreme Glucose Study
An accuracy study was performed to evaluate the performance of the VivaChek™ Fad and
Fad Smart Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems with 105 fingertip blood samples containing
extreme glucose concentrations at the extreme lower and upper ends of the claimed glucose
measuring range. Of the 105 blood samples, 29 samples were altered with glycolysis to
obtain glucose concentrations ≤ 80 mg/dL and 18 samples were supplemented with
additional glucose to obtain glucose concentrations ≥ 250 mg/dL. Results on the candidate
devices using 3 test strip lots were compared to the results obtained using the comparative
method (YSI 2300 STAT PLUS Glucose and L-Lactate Analyzer) and are summarized
below:

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit Study
The effect of hematocrit was evaluated with venous blood samples adjusted to hematocrit
levels of 20 to 70 % (20, 25, 30, 35, 42, 50, 55, 60, 65, and 70 %) at five glucose levels (30 to

50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250, and 251 to 400 mg/dL). The results obtained with the
device system were compared to those obtained with the comparator method (YSI 2300
analyzer). The results demonstrated acceptable performance of the candidate blood glucose
monitoring systems across the claimed hematocrit range of 20 to 70%.
2. Altitude Study
To evaluate the effects of altitude, a study was conducted using whole blood samples altered
to achieve 15 glucose concentrations ranging from 50.2 to 540.5 mg/dL Testing was
conducted at 10,413 feet. The results of obtained with the device system were compared to
those obtained with the comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results support the
claims that the device systems function as intended at altitudes up to the claimed altitude of
10,413 feet.
3. System Operating Conditions Study
To evaluate device performance over varying operating temperature and humidity conditions,
venous whole blood samples were adjusted to 3 glucose levels (60 to 70, 100 to 200, and 300
to 400 mg/dL). Testing was conducted under 4 combinations of temperature and relative
humidity (RH) including 113°F (45°C) and 41°F (5°C) each at 10% and 90% RH, and under
the nominal condition of 73°F (23°C) at 40% RH. The results obtained with the candidate
systems were compared to those obtained with the comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer).
The results support the claims in the labeling that the device systems can be used in
conditions of 41 to 113°F (5 to 45°C) with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
4. Sample Volume Study
Venous blood samples were prepared at 3 glucose range intervals (50 to 65, 100 to 120, and
200 to 250 mg/dL) and were tested at different sample volumes (0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 μL). The
results obtained with the device systems were compared to those obtained with the
comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results support the claimed minimum sample
volume of 0.8 μL for the device systems. The sponsor provided validation studies
demonstrating that with blood volumes below 0.8 μL, the insufficient sample volume error
message functioned as intended.
5. Flex Studies
The following additional flex studies were performed with the device system: drop/shock,
early test strip removal, intermittent sampling, sample outside measuring range, sample
perturbation, shipping, used test strips and vibration testing. The results demonstrated that the
performance of the device systems is robust under these conditions.
6. Infection Control Studies
The device systems are intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies
were performed on the external meter materials by an outside commercial laboratory to
demonstrate complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant
Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Registration No. 67619-12).
Robustness studies performed by the sponsor using each of the three device systems
demonstrated that there was no change in the performance of the systems or in the external
materials of the meters after 608 cycles of cleaning and disinfection using Clorox Healthcare
Bleach Germicidal Wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of

single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning
and disinfection procedures.
7. Electrical Safety and EMC Studies
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed and the device systems
were found to be compliant.
8. Test Strip Lot Release Protocol
The test strip lot release protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
