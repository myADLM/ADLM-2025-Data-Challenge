IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The HemoScreen is a point-of-care (POC), automated hematology analyzer that provides results
for complete blood count (CBC) parameters and a 5-part leukocyte differential, in capillary and
venous whole blood samples. The HemoScreen system is a tabletop device and is comprised of
the following components: HemoScreen reader (analyzer plus software), cartridge with
preloaded reagents, blood collection sampler, on-board internal quality control, and external
liquid quality controls.
The cartridge module comprises reagent compartments, a microfluidic chip and a translucent
measurement portion. The reagents in the cartridge enable viscoelastic focusing, lysis of RBC,
and WBC staining. In addition to the cartridge, the system includes a disposable sampler, which
is used to collect the blood sample and then transfer it to the cartridge.
The HemoScreen provides the following blood count parameters: red blood cells (RBC), white
blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular
(erythrocyte) volume (MCV), mean cell (erythrocyte) hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell
(erythrocyte) hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW),
mean platelets volume (MPV), neutrophils (NEUT; #/%), monocytes (MONO; #/%),
lymphocytes (LYMP; #/%), eosinophils (EO; #/%) and basophiles (BASO; #/%). Of these, RBC,
WBC, PLT, MCH, MCV, RDW, MPV, NEUT%, MONO%, LYMP%, EO%, and BASO% are

quantitated by direct measurement, and HCT, HGB, MCHC, NEUT#, MONO#, LYMPH#, EO#,
and BASO# are calculated from the direct measurements.
B Principle of Operation:
The HemoScreen analyzer includes several modules (optical, mechanical, and electrical
modules), a processor and controller that work together to measure blood samples that have been
prepared inside disposable cartridges. The blood sample is collected with an additional
disposable unit called a sampler. Once filled, the sampler is inserted into the cartridge in a single
action, whereupon the cartridge is inserted into the reader for automatic sample
preparation/staining and measurement. The cartridge is supplied preloaded with all required
reagents.
Once the cartridge is inserted into the reader, blood is expelled from the capillaries into the
reagent compartments. The reader then mixes the blood sample with the reagents by alternately
pressing compressible portions of the cartridge, eventually causing the suspension of cells to
flow into the microfluidic chamber. Cells flowing in the microfluidic chamber focus into a
single-cell plane due to viscoelastic focusing. The reader then captures images of the focused
cells and analyzes them in real time using machine vision algorithms. The reader interfaces with
the cartridge mechanically and optically, and has no direct contact with the fluid inside the
cartridge. When analysis is complete, the results are displayed to the user on the reader's touch
screen.
Leukocytes are classified based on their staining properties and morphology, whereas absolute
counts are obtained by counting the cells contained in a chamber of predetermined volume. Test
results are obtained within six minutes and the results are saved.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
HemoScreen Hematology Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is performed by manual keyboard entry or use of a barcode reader.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
HemoScreen can be used with either capillary or venous anticoagulated whole blood,
collected in K2EDTA. Capillary blood sampling is performed by routine fingertip puncture
using a standard lancet. The blood is collected in an K2EDTA microtube (indirect sampling)
which is then taken into Sampler or directly from fingertip drawn into Sampler (direct
sampling). Venous blood, thoroughly mixed and at room temperature, can be used as well.
4. Calibration:
Factory calibration. The calibration of HemoScreen is traceable to the reference methods
described in CLSI H26-A2.

5. Quality Control:
The HemoScreen system includes both on-board internal and external quality controls.
Internal quality control includes built-in self-tests, whereby the software verifies performance
of the optics, reagent mixing, and instrument pneumatics. Every time the analyzer is turned
on, and before each measurement, it automatically verifies conformance to the measurement
specifications. Furthermore, internal self-testing occurs after the cartridge has been inserted,
thus validating the integrity of the disposable unit. The intensity and spectrum of all
illumination sources are tested using corresponding sensors, and the optical properties of
each cartridge are inspected automatically prior to each test.
Liquid Quality Controls (PIX-CBC): PIX-CBC Hematology Controls, 3-level commercial
liquid quality controls are used to cover all HemoScreen parameters. CBC-PIX is a reagent
composed of human erythrocytes and mammalian leukocytes and platelets suspended in a
plasma-like fluid with preservatives. PIX-CBC whole blood controls (Cat No. PIX002) are
produced by R&D Systems, a Bio-Techne brand, Minneapolis, MN.

2. Transportation Environmental Test:
To support the updated transport conditions for the HemoScreen Sampler and Cartridge
modified from the original conditions cleared in K180020, additional testing was conducted
to support the conditions using ASTM D4332 and D5276 standards. The

Temperature/Humidity Cycling study assessed different sequences for temperature (-10°C,
23°C, 55°C) and humidity (≥90%, ≤30%). The device package underwent temperature
sequence at 23°C (90%Rh) for 24 hours and then -10°C for 24 hours. Within one (1) hour of
the temperature testing, drop/disturbance testing was conducted from different angles of the
package. The package underwent second cycle of temperature conditions at 23°C (90%Rh)
for 24 hours and then 55°C (30%Rh) for 24 hours. A second drop test was conducted within
an hour of the temperature testing. The performance passed the pre-defined acceptance
criteria.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
