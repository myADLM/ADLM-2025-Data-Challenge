III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The SmartBolus Calculator is software intended for the management of diabetes in persons aged
2 and older requiring rapid-acting U-100 insulin. The SmartBolus Calculator calculates a
suggested bolus dose based on user-entered carbohydrates, most recent sensor glucose value (or
blood glucose reading if using fingerstick), rate of change of the sensor glucose (if applicable),
insulin on board (IOB), and programmable correction factor, insulin to carbohydrate ratio, and
target glucose value. The SmartBolus Calculator is intended for single patient, home use and
requires a prescription.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
This device resides in the Omnipod 5 App and requires the App to function.
The SmartBolus Calculator works with the following rapid-acting U-100 insulins: NovoLog®
(insulin aspart), Humalog® (insulin lispro), and Admelog® (insulin lispro).
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The SmartBolus Calculator is a software device that resides in the Omnipod 5 App.
It requires input parameters and settings from the SmartAdjustTM Technology, a glycemic
controller (iAGC) and glucose values from a compatible integrated continuous glucose
monitoring system (iCGM) or blood glucose (BG) values from a blood glucose meter to
calculate suggested insulin bolus doses. The SmartBolus Calculator can be used in both open-
loop (manual mode) and closed-loop (automated mode). When used with a compatible iCGM,
the SmartBolus Calculator can use the sensor glucose values and trend information to calculate a
suggested bolus dose. When the SmartBolus Calculator is used with manually entered BG
readings it suggests a bolus dose based on the same calculations as the currently cleared
Omnipod DASH Insulin Management System bolus calculator (K180045, K192659).

B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Clinical Testing:
CGM-Informed Bolus Calculator Study: Preschool Cohort
A single-arm, multicenter, prospective clinical study was conducted to evaluate the performance
of the SmartBolus Calculator in patients with type 1 diabetes during Manual Mode (open-loop)
operation. The study enrolled 5 evaluable subjects aged 2.0-5.9 years old across two clinical
sites, and consisted of two 7-day outpatient phases of Omnipod 5 use:
• Phase 1: 7 days of Omnipod 5 use in Manual Mode without a connected CGM using
manual entry of BG values to deliver boluses
• Phase 2: 7 days of Omnipod 5 use in Manual Mode with a connected CGM using the
SmartBolus calculator to deliver boluses.
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of the CGM-informed bolus
calculator using glucose metrics of percentage of time < 70 mg/dL and percentage of time > 180
mg/dL during the 4-hour post bolus period from Phase 2 as compared to Phase 1. Data from the
clinical study is presented in the table below.
There were no deaths, unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE) or serious adverse events
(SAE) reported in this study. One (1) non-serious adverse event of prolonged hyperglycemia was
reported which resolved after a Pod change with appropriate subcutaneous insulin coverage
during the transition and appeared likely related to an infusion site issue rather than the
SmartBolus calculator itself.

2. In Silico Testing:
Simulations of possible input and output combinations were run to supplement information
collected in the Clinical Study. These simulations evaluated additional types and/or ranges of
variables in order to assess that different scenarios (including different bolus timing and
miscalculated carbohydrate content) do not affect safety of the device in the intended user
population.
3. Human Factors Testing:
The SmartBolus Calculator is a component of the Omnipod 5 System. Human factors validation
testing was conducted with the Omnipod 5 App installed on a compatible mobile device. Human
Factors validation study on the Omnipod 5 System as a whole was performed with 16
representative participants (i.e., caregivers of children 2-5.9 years old) and described in the
Decision Summary for K220394.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
