III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR is an automated immunofluorescent assay using Time-
Resolved Amplified Cryptate Emission (TRACE) technology for quantitative determination of
Chromogranin A concentration in human serum.
B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR is to be used in conjunction with other clinical methods as an
aid in monitoring of disease progression during the course of disease and treatment in patients
with gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs, grade 1 and grade 2).
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx – For Prescription Use Only
The Instruction for use of the device contains the following warnings:
• B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR should not be used for cancer screening or cancer
diagnosis.
• B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR is not indicated to be used as a stand-alone monitoring
assay and should be used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms and other
diagnostic evidence. In cases where the laboratory results do not agree with the clinical
picture or history, additional tests should be performed.
• The results reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the
Chromogranin A assay used. Values obtained with different assay methods cannot be used
interchangeably. If, in the course of monitoring a patient, the assay method used for
determining Chromogranin A levels is changed, additional tests should be carried out to
determine the baseline values.
• High levels of Chromogranin A (CgA) could also be found in cases of benign diseases (such
as gastro-intestinal disorders, kidney failure and cardiovascular disorders) and in cancers
other than NETs (such as adenocarcinoma of the breast, lung, or colon). CgA values may rise
during treatment with proton pump inhibitors.

B Principle of Operation:
B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR is a homogenous one-step immunoassay for the quantification
of CgA II in human serum using TRACE technology.
A sample volume of 14 μL is needed for each test. The sample probe of the analyzer pipettes and
dispenses the conjugates from the reagent kit and the sample into the wells. The probe is heated
to incubate the reagent-sample mixture, so it is at reaction temperature (37°C) prior to dispensing
and mixing in the reaction well. Incubation lasts for 29 minutes. During this time, a complex
comprised of a Chromogranin A (CgA) analyte “sandwiched” between two monoclonal mouse
anti-CgA antibodies is formed. One of the antibodies (537/H2) is directed at the epitope AA124–
144 and labelled with DiSMP cryptate, the other antibody (541/E2) binds to AA280-301 and is
labelled with Alexa Fluor 647. The signal generated by the cryptate at 620 nm serves as an
internal reference and is measured simultaneously with the long-lived acceptor signal at 665 nm
K222251 - Page 3 of 19

--- Page 4 ---
which is the specific signal. The fluorescent signal is proportional to the concentration of the
analyte to be measured. The linear direct measuring range of the assay is from 20−3,000 ng/mL,
going up to 1,000,000 ng/mL with automated dilution.

2. Linearity:
a) Linearity studies:
Linearity studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI guideline EP06, 2nd Edition.
Three series of samples were prepared by mixing three High samples with Low sample to
span the analytical measuring interval of the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR. Low
sample used two individual normal human serum samples. Three High samples were
pooled human serum with CgA concentrations of 3,401 ng/mL, 301 ng/mL and 52.3
ng/mL. Samples in three series were measured in five replicates and the ‘measured value’
(mean CgA ng/mL) was compared to its predicted value for deviation percentage using a
weighted least squares regression analysis. This deviation was then compared to the
allowable deviation from linearity (ADL). The results are summarized in table below.
Range
Sample Slope (95%CI) Intercept (95%CI) R² % Bias**
(ng/mL)
1 296–3401 1.02 (1.01; 1.03) -66.11 (-73.07; -59.15) 0.998 -2.6% − 4.9%
2 39–301 1.08 (1.07; 1.10) -10.96 (-12.77; -9.15) 0.997 -4.2% − 7.8%
3 15–52 1.04 (1.01; 1.06) -2.05 (-2.85; -1.24) 0.994 -6.8% − 3.3%
1-2-3* 15–3401 0.98 (0.96; 0.99) -0.45 ( -1.41; 0.51) 0.992 -14.1% − 12.7%
*Combined from Sample 1, 2 and 3
**Minimum and maximum deviation from linearity
The results support the linearity of the claimed B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR
‘analytical measuring interval’ (AMI) of 20 to 3,000 ng/mL.
b) Dilutional Recovery Studies:
Dilutional recovery studies were conducted using 10 pools of human serum samples with
different CgA concentrations. The samples were diluted on the instrument with the
diluent of the assay, with the following user specified dilution factors 1:2, 1:3, 1:5, 1:10,
1:20 and 1:25 (for samples with concentration below 1,000 ng/mL) and 1:2, 1:3, 1:5,

1:10, 1:20, 1:25 and 1:50 (for samples with concentration above 1,000 ng/mL). The
samples were measured by two operators over six runs, in duplicates with three lots of
reagents on three instruments. The sample testing was divided between the reagent lots
and instruments (all samples were not tested by all lots and instruments). The mean
recoveries were between 97.6 % and 109.6 %. The results show that the dilutions
performed by the instrument are within specifications.
c) Spiking Recovery Studies:
Spiking recovery studies were conducted with 13 individual human serum samples with
different CgA concentrations ranging from 43.1 ng/mL to 2,875 ng/mL, covering the
AMI of the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR. Seven samples (Group A) were spiked
(1:1) with a sample at 88.8 ng/mL prepared with recombinant CgA antigen diluted in
normal human serum and six samples (Group B) were spiked (1:1) with a sample at 938
ng/mL prepared with recombinant CgA antigen diluted in normal human serum. The
samples were measured in duplicate by one operator in a single run on one instrument
with one lot of B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR, before and after spiking and the
recoveries between the ‘measured values’ (mean CgA ng/mL) and the expected
concentrations were calculated for the 13 spiked samples. The measured CgA ng/mL in
spiked samples and expected CgA ng/mL calculated for each sample and the % recovery
of measured CgA ng/mL is presented in the table below.
Original Sample Expected Value Measured Value

B5 1,994 1,466 1,450 99%
B6 2,594 1,766 1,727 98%
The % recovery ranged from 91% to 109%, supporting the spike recovery of the
B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR across the claimed AMI (20 to 3,000 ng/mL).
d) High Dose Hook Effect:
Hook effect of the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR was determined by spiking
recombinant human CgA in normal human serum. Twenty-nine dilutions with CgA
concentrations ranging from 200,000 ng/mL down to 12 ng/mL were measured in
duplicate with one lot of reagents on one instrument. The measurement of samples above
3,000 ng/mL was done without the auto-dilution process. No high dose hook effect is
expected with the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR assay for CgA concentrations up to
23,000 ng/mL.

Note: High concentration samples (> 3,000 ng/mL) are detected in the first few seconds
of incubation and may be diluted by the appropriate dilution factor, then re-assayed
automatically. Potential Hook Effect is detected by kinetics analysis of the samples by
B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR analyzer family.
e) Extended Measuring Interval:
Extended measuring range study was conducted in accordance with CLSI guideline
EP34, 1st Edition. A total of 10 individual human serum samples with concentrations
between 25,000 ng/mL and 50,000 ng/mL were diluted with dilution factor at 1:25.
Samples with concentrations between 75,000 ng/mL and 1,000,000 ng/mL were diluted
with dilution factor at 1:500. Manual dilutions and dilutions performed by the
B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact PLUS instrument were done with one B·R·A·H·M·S
CgA II KRYPTOR reagent lot. The measurements were done by one operator with three
runs on two instruments. Recovery results for dilution factor at 1:25 for samples with
concentrations between 25,280 ng/mL up to 47,137 ng/mL are between 94% and 104%.
Recovery results for dilution factor at 1:500 for samples with concentrations between
75,051 ng/mL up to 1,067,721 ng/mL are between 96% and 102%. These results showed
that the dilution at 1:25 and 1:500 performed by the B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact
PLUS instrument are consistent with manual dilutions.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference study was performed according to CLSI guidelines EP07 (3rd Edition) and EP37
(1st Edition) guidelines to determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous
substances on the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR assay. Two or three native human
serum pools with a target concentration of 93.7, 619, 86.3, 132 and 1,177 ng/mL were split
between three lots of B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR reagents, two lots of B·R·A·H·M·S
CgA II KRYPTOR CAL and QC. Testing was conducted by four operators using four
instruments. The samples were supplemented with potentially interfering or cross-reactive
compounds and measured in three replicates. The percent bias was determined by comparing
the result of sample with interferent or cross-reactant to a control sample without the
interferent or cross-reactant. An interference or cross-reactivity within ± 10% bias between
the mean spiked sample value and the mean control value was considered non-significant.
a) Endogenous Substance Interference:
The following endogenous substances were tested using B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II
KRYPTOR assay. No significant interference was found for each substance at the

is 1,000,000 ng/mL. The Reportable Range (the lower limit of the AMI to the maximum
dilution concentration) is 20 to 1,000,000 ng/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability:
There is no recognized international standard for Chromogranin A (CgA). Calibration of
the CgA is traceable to in-house reference calibrators (first lot produced during
development of the assay), whose CgA values have been assigned in accordance with
ISO 17511:2020 (2nd Edition).
b) Kit Stability:
The stability of the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR reagent kit was determined
according to CLSI guideline EP25-A.
i) Reagent kit stability (shelf-life):
A real-time stability study was performed using unopened B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II
KRYPTOR reagent stored at 2°C to 8°C. Seven samples with concentrations from 25
ng/mL to 2,781 ng/mL were tested in five replicates per sample at manufacturing time
point (Time 0) and at 2, 3 and 4 months of storage time points. Results support the 4-
month shelf-life stability claim for the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR reagent kit
at 2°C to 8°C.
An accelerated stability study was conducted B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR
reagent at three elevated temperatures of 45°C, 37°C and 30°C. Four serum samples
were measured in duplicates at 11 different times points [including day zero (0) and
between day 3 and 52 days depending on the temperature] with each reagent stored at
the three elevated temperatures. The results support a temporary shelf-life claim for
the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR reagents at 2°C to 8°C for 9 months.
An additional real-time stability study conducted on three B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II
KRYPTOR reagent lots using human serum samples for > 9 months storage claims is
ongoing.
ii) Onboard stability:
The B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR reagent unit onboard stability study was
performed by testing seven serum samples for up to 30 days after a reagent unit was
reconstituted and placed on-board a B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact PLUS
instrument (on-board storage temperature, 2°C to 8°C). The results support on-board
stability claim for the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR reagents at 2°C to 8°C for
29 days.
c) Sample Stability:
i) Sample stability at room temperature (RT):
Twelve fresh serum samples were stored at RT (18−25°C) and tested at 5 hours, 24
hours, 48 hours and 72 hours by one operator with two lots of B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II
KRYPTOR reagents using two instruments. The CgA concentration data obtained at
the different time points were plotted against T0 measurements and analyzed by
K222251 - Page 11 of 19

--- Page 12 ---
Passing-Bablok regression analysis. The slopes between 1.02 and 1.08 and correlation
coefficients between 0.97 and 0.99 support 48 hours sample stability claim at room
temperature (18−25°C).
ii) Sample stability at -20°C:
Four serum samples across AMI were divided each into 10 aliquot samples. Aliquot
samples were stored at -20°C and tested in duplicate at day 0 (fresh measurement),
day 15, day 31 and day 32 by one operator with one lot of B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II
KRYPTOR reagents using one instrument. Percent concentration change was
computed based on linear regression analysis of aliquot-specific mean concentrations
vs. time. The results support sample stability claims of one month at -20°C.
iii) Freeze-Thaw stability:
Four serum samples across AMI were aliquoted. Four of those aliquots were tested at
time point T0 (fresh measurement) and the other four aliquots after claimed number
of freeze/thaw cycles (each cycle consisted of freezing and storage at -20°C for at
least 12 hours and thawing for about 30 min at room temperature before re-freezing
or measurement). The samples were tested by one operator with one lot of
B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR reagent using one instrument. The results support
serum CgA concentrations stability up to four freeze and thaw cycles for samples
stored at -20°C.
6. Detection Capability:
CLSI guideline EP17-A2 was followed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of
Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR.
LoB:
Four blank samples (CgA depleted serum samples) were tested in five replicates per run,
three runs per sample using two B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR reagent lots (Lot A and
Lot B; 4 x 5 x 3 = 60 replicates for each lot) on two instruments. The LoB was calculated
using the parametric option as the distribution of the LoB values was considered as normal.
This gave the LoB value 11.1 ng/mL for Lot A and 11.3 ng/mL for Lot B. The claimed LoB
for the BꞏRꞏAꞏHꞏMꞏS CgA II KRYPTOR is 11.3 ng/mL.
LoD:
Four low CgA concentration serum samples were run in five replicates per run, three runs per
sample using two B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR reagent lots (Lot A and Lot B; 4 x 5 x 3
= 60 replicates for each lot) on two instruments. The parametric analysis was used as 120
measurement results from four LoD samples followed normal distribution in each group.
This gave the LoD value 14.0 ng/mL for Lot A and 13.9 ng/mL for Lot B. The claimed LoD
for the BꞏRꞏAꞏHꞏMꞏS CgA II KRYPTOR is 14.0 ng/mL.
LoQ:
A precision profile was created using seven low CgA concentration serum samples using
three lots of B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR reagents (Lot A, Lot B and Lot C). A within-
laboratory precision study of 60 measurements (3 lots x 5 days x 2 runs x 2 replicates) was
performed. Within-laboratory %CV was calculated for each sample and for the three reagent
lots. The estimated LoQ of B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR determined using CgA
K222251 - Page 12 of 19

--- Page 13 ---
concentration with 20% CV estimates, was 7.9 ng/mL for Lot A, 9.1 ng/mL for Lot B and 8.6
ng/mL for Lot C. The lowest measurand concentration that can be measured with respect to
pre-specified % CV acceptance criterion was set at 20 ng/mL. The claimed LoQ for the
BꞏRꞏAꞏHꞏMꞏS CgA II KRYPTOR is 20 ng/mL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not applicable. The predicate measures a different analyte. See clinical studies.
2. Matrix Comparison:
Not applicable. The assay is for serum samples only.
C Clinical Studies:
The effectiveness of the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR as an aid in monitoring the course of
progressive or non-progressive disease in patients with well-defined Gastroentero-pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) grade 1 and 2, was determined through a prospective,
multi-center, observational study in the expected study duration of 32 months. Course of disease
was assessed by standard imaging (CT/MRI scans) and tumors were classified by Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria for progression (progressive disease)
vs. no progression (complete response, partial response, or stable disease). Tumor progression
was coded in binary format based on RECIST tumor classification. The two classes of tumor
progression were defined as: (1) “progression” (or “positive”) if the target tumor response was
categorized as “Progressive Disease (PD)” and (2) “no progression” (or “negative”) if the target
tumor response was categorized as “Complete Response (CR)”, “Partial Response (PR)” or
“Stable Disease (SD)”.

The analysis for the time to follow-up visits shows that 92% (421/459) follow-up visits occurred
within the first 24 months of the study and 8% (38/459) follow-up visits occurred between 24
and 36 months after study initiation. The analysis for the time between visits shows that 96%
(439/459) follow-up visits occurred within 2 and 13 months after the previous visit, i.e., within
one of the recommended time windows in the study protocol. Seven follow-up visits occurred
earlier than 2 months after the previous visit and 13 visits later than 13 months after the previous
visit. The overall number of progressions ranged from one (13.7%) over two (7.8%) over three
(3.3%) to more than three (5.2%). 69.9% of the patients did not have any tumor progression. The
overall number of no progressions ranged from zero (5.9%) over one (32.7%) over two (22.2%)
over three (15.0%) to more than three (24.2%).

A total of 612 visits/observations (153 baseline visits, 459 follow-up visits) was undertaken with
an average number of four observations/visits per patient. The B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR
result is considered as positive when 50% increase of CgA serum concentrations (ΔCgA>50%)
to a value of greater than 100 ng/mL between consecutive monitoring visits. The test result is
considered as negative when a change of CgA serum concentrations is less than or equal to 50%
increase or to a value of CgA concentration below or equal to 100 ng/mL between monitoring
visits. The results of the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR from 153 adult GEP-NET patients
(grade 1 and 2) were analyzed and comparing with clinical assessment based on tumor
progression as classified by RECIST 1.1 criteria. The clinical performance characteristics of the
B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR relative to progression were evaluated, with two-sided 95%
confidence interval (CI), for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative
predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and negative likelihood ratio (NLR).
The results are summarized in tables below.

To account for the correlations of the multiple CgA II measurements within each patient,
confidence intervals were calculated using bootstrap method and the Boot package (R version
4.0.5). The test meets minimum requirements of the statistical validity including the requirement
that PPV (57.9%) is statistically significantly higher than prevalence (20.9%); the lower bound
of 95% confidence interval for PPV (40.5%) is above prevalence (20.9%); NPV (84.3%) is
statistically higher than 1−prevalence (79.1%); the lower bound of 95% confidence interval for
NPV (79.3%) is above 1−prevalence (79.1%); PLR (5.20) is > 1 and NLR (0.70) is < 1.

In summary, the clinical study results support the intended use of B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II
KRYPTOR as an “aid in monitoring of disease progression during the course of disease and
treatment in patients with gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs, grade 1
and grade 2).”
D Clinical Cut-Off:
The clinical cut-off was derived from a retrospective, bicentric observational pilot study of 102
patients with diagnosed well-differentiated G1 and G2 GEP-NETs in the U.S. During routine
monitoring visits serum CgA concentrations were assessed in comparison to standard imaging
(CT/MRI) and tumors were classified by RECIST 1.1 criteria for progression (progressive
disease) vs. no progression (complete response, partial response or stable disease).
Positive test result
ΔCgA > 50% and CgA > 100 ng/mL
An increase of CgA serum concentrations of more than 50% to a value of greater than 100
ng/mL between consecutive monitoring visits defines a positive test result representing a
higher probability that a tumor progression has occurred.
Negative test result
ΔCgA ≤ 50% or CgA ≤ 100 ng/mL
A change of CgA serum concentrations of equal or less than 50% increase between
monitoring visits or to a value of 100 ng/mL or less defines a negative test result representing
a lower probability that a tumor progression has occurred.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The reference range of the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR was established per CLSI EP28-
A3c. Serum specimens from 208 samples from healthy subjects (age ≥ 22 and ≤ 87 years,
collected in the U.S.) were assessed using the B·R·A·H·M·S CgA II KRYPTOR on the
B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact PLUS analyzer. The results are presented in the table below:
N = 208*
CgA (ng/mL)
Min 18.3
Max 447.7
Mean 75.4
Median 61.8
Standard deviation 59.6
95th percentile 187.0
97.5th percentile 270.1
*Two values identified as outliers by Dixon’s outlier test were excluded
from the analysis because their deviation from the preceding value was
more than 33% of the total range covered by the samples
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
