A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
MissLanTM Digital Pregnancy Rapid Test is intended for the qualitative detection of human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine, as an aid in early detection of pregnancy. It is intended
for use by people who would like to find out whether they are pregnant in a home environment.
Only for use outside the body. For over the counter use.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over the Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The MissLanTM Digital Pregnancy Rapid Test is a lateral flow immunoassay with a digital
display for detection of hCG. The test is packaged as a single test or as two tests, assembled in a
plastic housing with an absorbent tip and includes a package insert with instructions. The device
can be used in both dip and midstream modes. The result is displayed digitally by using a light
source to detect a colored test. It is for over-the-counter use.
B Principle of Operation:
The MissLanTM Digital Pregnancy Rapid Test is a lateral flow immunoassay. To use the test, the
user either 1) dips the absorbent tip into the urine for 10 seconds or 2) uses the midstream
technique to place the absorbent tip into the stream of urine for 10 seconds. The user then places
the test on a flat surface. As the liquid flows to the test area of the test strip, hCG in the urine
specimen reacts with the anti-βhCG antibody-colloidal gold conjugate to form a compound. The
compound is captured by the anti-αhCG antibody immobilized on the test area. A colored test
line will develop if the hCG concentration is above the threshold, indicating a positive result. If
there is no hCG in the urine, no colored line develops in the test zone, indicating a negative
result. A colored line will develop in the control zone if sufficient sample volume has been
applied to the test strip.
The MissLanTM Digital Pregnancy Rapid Test utilizes a light emitting diode (LED) as a light
source and light reflection to determine the presence or absence of the colored test and control
lines. After adding the sample, the hourglass symbol will flash until two beeps are heard,
indicating sufficient sample collection time. Within 5 minutes two beep sounds will be heard, the
K222305 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
hourglass symbol will disappear, and the result will be shown on the display screen. If the test
result is positive, a “+” symbol is displayed on the screen. If the result is negative, a “-” symbol
is displayed on the screen. If the test result is invalid, a book symbol is displayed on the screen.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A pooled negative female human urine sample was spiked with hCG to provide nine urine
samples with hCG concentrations of 0, 12.5, 15, 18.75, 22.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 mIU/mL.
Each sample was tested using 3 lots of the MissLanTM Digital Pregnancy Rapid Test. The
tests were performed in replicates of 10, over the course of 5 non-consecutive days by 3
different operators using both the dip and midstream method. Each operator conducted
testing using one lot. A total of 150 tests per concentration were performed per sampling
method. The device cutoff is 25 mIU/mL hCG.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative device.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity:
The candidate device was tested for potential cross-reactivity from luteinizing hormone (LH),
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Urine
specimens from non-pregnant females were pooled and used to prepare samples with hCG
levels of 0 mIU/mL, 5 mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL that were then spiked with each cross
reactants at the following concentrations: 500 mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH, and 1000
mIU/mL TSH. Samples were tested in replicates of 3 with 3 lots of the candidate device. The
results demonstrated no cross reactivity at the LH, FSH and TSH concentrations tested in
either negative or positive urine samples.
Interference:
A urine pool from non-pregnant females was used to prepare samples with hCG levels of 5
mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL that were then spiked with potentially interfering exogenous and
endogenous substances (test samples). Samples were tested in 3 replicates on 3 lots by 3
operators on the candidate device. The results demonstrated no interference from substances
at the concentrations shown in the table below.

Effect of hCG β-core fragment:
Negative female urine samples (0 and 5 mIU/mL hCG) and positive urine samples (25
mIU/mL and 20,000 mIU/mL hCG) were spiked with hCG β-core fragment at concentrations
of 50,000 pmol/L, 125,000 pmol/L, 250,000 pmol/L and 500,000 pmol/L. The results
demonstrated that the candidate device is not affected by concentrations of hCG beta-core
fragment up to 500,000 pmol/L.
Effect of urine pH:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in urine pH, urine samples containing 0
mIU/mL, 5 mIU/mL, and 25 mIU/mL hCG were adjusted to pH values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0
and 9.0 and tested using the candidate device. The results demonstrated that changes in pH
ranging from 4.0 to 9.0 do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the device.
Effect of urine specific gravity
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, urine samples containing
0 mIU/mL, 5 mIU/mL, and 25 mIU/mL hCG were adjusted to specific gravities of 1.000,
1.005, 1.010, 1.020, 1.030 and 1.035. The results demonstrated that changes in specific
gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.035 do not interfere with either positive or negative results
from the device.
High dose hook effect study:
Negative pooled female urine samples spiked with varying hCG concentrations (6,250,
12,500, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, and 500,000 mIU/mL) were tested on 3 lots of the
candidate device. No hook effect was observed at concentrations up to 500,000 mIU/mL
hCG.

The detection limit was determined in the precision study (see Section VII.A.1. above).
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The device’s cut-off is 25 mIU/mL. See Precision/Reproducibility (Section VII.A.1.) section
above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A total of 200 urine samples were collected from women with ages ranging from 18 to 45
years, who presented to 3 clinics for pregnancy testing. Approximately half of the 200
women were suspected to be pregnant and most of them were in the early stages of
pregnancy (less than 5 weeks). The samples were masked and randomized prior to testing by
professionals using the candidate device (in dip mode and midstream mode) and the
predicate device (Preview® Digital Pregnancy Test; in dip mode and midstream mode). One
hundred (100) samples were tested per sampling mode across 3 lots. A summary of the
results is presented in the table below:
