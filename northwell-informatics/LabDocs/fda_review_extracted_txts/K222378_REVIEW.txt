IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
The VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Levofloxacin has the following concentrations in the card:
0.25, 0.5, 2, 8 (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The
Levofloxacin MIC result range for the VITEK 2 is ≤0.125 to ≥8 μg/mL. For all species, the MIC
result range indicates that the VITEK 2 system is capable of producing the following MIC results
≤0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and ≥8 for AST-GN Levofloxacin test. This means the VITEK 2
systems does not provide results lower than 0.125µg/mL, or greater than 8 µg/mL for the AST-
GN Levofloxacin test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the VITEK 2 AST-GN Levofloxacin was previously evaluated during
review of K072038 and was determined to be acceptable (refer to the K072038 Decision
Summary).
In summary, a panel of 48 gram-negative isolates were tested in triplicate, each for three days
at three sites using the manual and auto-dilution methods.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Not applicable
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Quality Control (QC) testing, Inoculum and Growth failure for the VITEK 2 GN-AST
Levofloxacin were previously evaluated during review of K072038 and were determined to
be acceptable.
QC specific to the change in breakpoints for Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
was not performed since the QC ranges used in K072038 were unchanged in the current
submission and did not impact the performance.
Additional quality control testing was performed during testing of Salmonella species as
there are now FDA-recognized breakpoints for this organism group.
The QC organisms recommended by both the FDA and CLSI, namely E. coli ATCC 25922
and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, were tested a minimum of twenty times by both the VITEK
2 GN-AST Levofloxacin card and the reference method at one site. The Levofloxacin card
(≤0.125 - ≥8 ug/mL) does not cover the expected result range of the QC organism E. coli
ATCC 25922 of 0.008-0.06 ug/mL and produced off-scale QC MIC values. This was
addressed in the labeling by adding the following footnote under the Quality Control Table:
K222378 - Page 6 of 12

--- Page 7 ---
“Does not include the CLSI/FDA recommended dilution range for QC testing with this
organism”.
Testing of off-scale E. coli ATCC 25922 was considered acceptable since testing of the
secondary QC strain, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 produced on-scale MIC results. No QC
trending was observed with P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853.
The quality control data generated during testing of Salmonella spp. was combined with that
of the original clinical trial. The QC results obtained were in the recommended range >95%
of the time for the reference method and with the VITEK 2 systems with all
inoculation/reading methods as shown in Table 1, which is acceptable.

The VITEK 2 AST-GN Levofloxacin (≤0.125 - ≥8µg/mL) was originally cleared in
premarket submission K072038 and included indications for Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa
and Acinetobacter spp. tested with VITEK 2 auto and manual dilution. The VITEK 2
Compact was not tested in the original submission. This was considered acceptable based on
an equivalency study in K050002.
Since no changes were made to the design or dilution range of the VITEK 2 AST card, the
performance of the VITEK 2 AST-GN Levofloxacin card with Enterobacterales and P.
aeruginosa using revised interpretive criteria currently recognized by the FDA was evaluated
using data obtained in the original 510(k) premarket submission K072038.
Since FDA no longer recognizes breakpoints for Acinetobacter spp. and other Non-
Enterobacterales, 107 isolates of Acinetobacter spp. and 10 other Non-Enterobacterales were
removed from the dataset.
The re-analyzed combined clinical and challenge data with the updated breakpoints included
346 Enterobacterales (295 clinical isolates and 51 challenge isolates) and 225 P. aeruginosa
isolates (190 clinical isolates and 35 challenge isolates) that were originally tested on the
VITEK 2 and the automated dilution, as shown in Table 2.
The re-analyzed challenge set of 51 Enterobacterales isolates and 35 P. aeruginosa isolates
that were originally tested with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 instrument is
shown in Table 3.
One Salmonella isolate was tested in the original submission K072038, and an additional 48
combined (17 clinical and 31 challenge) isolates of Salmonella spp. were tested and added to
the original data set for evaluation with the VITEK 2 automatic dilution method to obtain the
claim for this species. The challenge set of 31 Salmonella spp. isolates was also tested with
the manual dilution method with the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact Systems. The
testing of Salmonella species was performed at one site with all dilution methods (manual
and auto) and reading methods (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). Data with Salmonella
spp. is summarized in Table 2 and Table 3.

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the MIC result of the reference method and that of the
VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are

doubling dilutions from the on scale result. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the
reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK 2 test card.
The combined Essential Agreement (EA) and Categorical Agreement (CA) for each
organism group (Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa and Salmonella spp.) is >90% which is
acceptable, as described in the “Class II Special Control Guidance Document: Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA, August 2009” (AST
guidance). There were 7 minor errors (2.0%) with Enterobacterales, 13 minor errors (5.7%)
and two major errors (1.6%) with P. aeruginosa, and one minor error (2.08%) with
Salmonella spp.

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the MIC result of the reference method and that of the VITEK 2 test
card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the VITEK 2
test card and the reference method or those in which an off scale result is at least two doubling dilutions from the on scale result.
Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of
the VITEK 2 test card.
The EA and CA for each organism group (Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa and Salmonella spp.)
challenge set is >90% with the manual dilution option and the VITEK 2 systems, which is
acceptable as noted in the AST guidance. There were 2 minor errors (5.71%) obtained with P.
aeruginosa, one minor error with Salmonella spp. (3.22%) and no minor errors with
Enterobacterales isolates. There were no major errors or very major errors obtained with any of
the indicated organism tested when applying the current FDA-recognized breakpoints.

As required under 511A(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the
following statement is included in the device labeling to address testing of non-indicated species:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.
Resistant Organisms
The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s) is unknown
because resistant strains were either not available or an insufficient number were encountered at
the time of comparative testing:
• Levofloxacin (lev02n): Citrobacter freundii, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, Klebsiella
oxytoca, Morganella morganii, Pantoea agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus
vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Salmonella spp.
MIC Trending Analysis
A trending reanalysis was performed using the combined (clinical and challenge)
Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa data obtained in K072038 to align with current trending
analysis methods utilized and to also assess the data from additional testing with Salmonella spp.
isolates with the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method.
This trending calculation takes into account MIC values that are determined to be one or more
doubling dilutions lower or higher than the reference method irrespective of whether the device
MIC values are on-scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least
one dilution higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in
the trending analysis.
Organisms in which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs. lower MIC
values was ≥ 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined to be statistically
significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that showed higher or lower
MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in the labeling.
A statistically significant trend toward higher MIC values was observed Escherichia coli,
Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a statistically significant trend toward
lower MIC values was observed Serratia marcescens species. No trending was observed with
Salmonella spp. (Table 4). The following footnote to the performance table was included in the
original package insert to address the trending observed for VITEK 2 AST-GN Levofloxacin:
“VITEK 2 Levofloxacin MIC values for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa tended to be in exact agreement or at least one doubling dilution
higher when compared to the reference agar dilution method. VITEK 2 Levofloxacin MIC
values for Serratia marcescens tended to be in exact agreement or at least one doubling
dilution lower when compared to the reference agar dilution”.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling was updated to include:
• The statement required by the 21st Century Cures Act legislation to address testing of non-
indicated species.
• Updated breakpoints for Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa with Levofloxacin.
• Updated performance using the current FDA-recognized breakpoints, along with a limitation
for lack of insufficient resistant isolates to reflect results obtained from this evaluation.
• Inclusion of Salmonella spp. in the Intended Use/Indication for use along with supportive
performance data using currently recognized breakpoints.
• Removal of claims for testing of Acinetobacter spp. and other Non-Enterobacterales due to
lack of FDA-recognized breakpoints.
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 System with Levofloxacin when revised breakpoints for
this drug are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, BioMérieux will update the
Levofloxacin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
