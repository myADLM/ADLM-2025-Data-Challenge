Escherichia coli
The VITEK 2 Gram-Negative Susceptibility Card is intended for use with the VITEK 2 Systems
in clinical laboratories as an in vitro test to determine the susceptibility of clinically significant
aerobic Gram-negative bacilli to antimicrobial agents when used as instructed.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using VITEK 2 Systems 9.04 software
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
K222430 - Page 2 of 11

loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Fosfomycin has the following concentrations in the card: 2, 8, 16,
and 64 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The fosfomycin
MIC result range for the VITEK 2 Gram Negative Fosfomycin is ≤ 4 to ≥ 256 µg/mL.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Fosfomycin was conducted at
three external clinical sites using a panel of 10 E. coli isolates. Each isolate was tested in
triplicate, using separate inocula, over three days for a total of 270 data points. Inocula were
prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing in the VITEK 2
System. In addition, inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method for use with the
VITEK 2 Compact. The mode of MIC values was determined for each isolate and the
reproducibility was calculated based on the number of MIC values that fell within ±1 doubling
dilution of the mode. The data were analyzed taking into consideration best-case and worst-case
scenarios as described in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.

Quality Control (QC) Testing:
The CLSI recommends four QC strains for testing fosfomycin, namely Escherichia coli
ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212
and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213.
One organism, E. coli ATCC 25922, was tested a sufficient number of times (i.e., at least
20/site) at each testing site using both the VITEK 2 card and agar dilution (AD) reference
method. Both the automatic dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK
2 and the manual dilution method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact. The QC organism
was tested by the automatic dilution method at the four clinical sites and at the sponsor’s
laboratory while the manual VITEK 2 and COMPACT testing was performed at only the
four clinical sites. This QC organism yielded off-scale VITEK 2 fosfomycin MICs of ≤ 4
µg/mL (Table 2). A VITEK result of ≤ 4 µg/mL is considered acceptable for this organism.

Device Failure
Device failures occurred at each of the test sites on 12 different days. These involved failure of
an instrument to fill cards properly, pipettor errors, failure of an instrument to connect to the
computer, failure of an instrument to recognize a card, an instrument rejecting cards, a reader
error, and a card being dropped on the floor before testing. All failures were resolved by one of
the following: repeat testing with the original inoculum; card replacement; straightening of
kinked tubing; technician intervention, or BioMérieux intervention. There was no impact on
testing or results.
Growth Failure Rate
A total of 380 clinical and challenge isolates were tested by VITEK 2 Fosfomycin. No growth
failure was recorded and all 380 isolates have VITEK 2 AST results available.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Testing of fosfomycin on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card was performed at four
clinical sites. There were 300 clinical isolates and 80 challenge isolates tested for a total of
380 isolates. Results obtained with the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card with fosfomycin
were compared to results obtained with the CLSI recommended agar dilution testing
conditions. The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Fosfomycin is ≤4 to
≥256 μg/mL for Escherichia coli. The reference method testing consisted of two-fold serial
dilutions of fosfomycin with a range of ≤0.25 to ≥1024 μg/mL. The testing conditions for the
reference method consisted of the following:
• Medium – Mueller Hinton agar with addition of 25 µg/mL of glucose-6-phosphate
and appropriate dilutions of antimicrobial solution added
• Inoculum – Direct colony suspension
• Incubation – 35°C; 16-24 hours
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test inocula
used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using the
DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 300 clinical isolates were evaluated at four sites: the majority were recently
isolated from clinical specimens and the remainder were stock isolates. Complete test results
K222430 - Page 8 of 11

--- Page 9 ---
are available for all 300 clinical isolates. All clinical isolates were tested with the auto-
dilution option of the VITEK 2.
A total of 80 E. coli challenge isolates were evaluated at one site. The challenge set was
tested with the auto-dilution and manual dilution options of the VITEK 2 and with the
manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact.
At the time of comparative testing, 14 resistant isolates and 1 intermediate isolate were
available for E. coli. The 14 resistant isolates comprise 3.6% of 380 total isolates. However,
since the resistant breakpoint is at the upper limit of the reporting range, an upward shift in
MIC values may not be easily detected. Since resistance rate to Fosfomycin is relatively low,
the occurrence of such shifts may be rare. However, the following footnote is included in the
device labeling to inform users of this issue:
An MIC shift in the resistance range (≥256 µg/mL) will be unknown since the resistant
breakpoint and the upper limit of the reporting range is the same.
Clinical and Challenge Data –VITEK 2 Auto-Dilution
VITEK 2 AST-GP Fosfomycin performance was determined with 380 isolates (300 clinical
isolates and 80 challenge isolates). The 80 challenge isolates were also tested at one site with the
manual dilution option for the VITEK 2 Compact system. The data are summarized in Table 4.
The overall performance of using the VITEK 2 auto-dilution is acceptable with an EA of 99.2%
and a CA of 99.7%. There were no major or very major errors. The overall performance of the
manual dilution option of the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems is acceptable with an EA
of 100% and a CA of 98.8%% with the VITEK 2 Compact system. There were no major or very
major errors.

Essential agreement (EA) occurs when the result of the reference method and that of the VITEK 2 AST-Gram
Negative Fosfomycin are within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are
those that are on-scale for both the reference method and the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Fosfomycin or results
in which an off-scale result is at least two doubling dilutions from the on scale result. Category agreement (CA)
occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation provided
by the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Fosfomycin.
Resistance Mechanism Characterization
The FDA drug label for Fosfomycin does not indicate any specific mechanisms of resistance.
As required under 511A(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the
following statement is included in the Precautions section of the device labeling to address
testing and reporting of non-indicated species:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.
MIC Trends
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained for
each inoculation method (Table 5). This trending calculation analyzes device MIC values that are
determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher than the reference method. MIC
values that are off-scale for both the reference and device are not considered in the trending
analysis. A difference between the percentage of isolates with higher or lower MIC values ≥30%
with a statistically significant confidence interval are considered to have evidence of trending.
No trending was detected for 22 on-scale results with VITEK 2 auto dilution.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-GN Fosfomycin when revised breakpoints for
fosfomycin are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the
fosfomycin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
