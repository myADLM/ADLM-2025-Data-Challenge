III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The A-LYTE® Integrated Multisensor (IMT Na K Cl) is for in vitro diagnostic use in the
quantitative determination of sodium, potassium, and chloride (Na, K, Cl) in human serum,
plasma (lithium heparin) and urine using the Atellica CI ®analyzer.
Measurements of sodium obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
aldosteronism (excessive secretion of the hormone aldosterone), diabetes insipidus (chronic
excretion of large amounts of dilute urine, accompanied by extreme thirst), adrenal hypertension,
Addison's disease (caused by destruction of the adrenal glands), dehydration, inappropriate
antidiuretic hormone secretion, or other diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.
Measurements of potassium obtained by this device are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the
diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium
levels.
Chloride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic
disorders such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Atellica® CI Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The A-LYTE® Integrated Multisensor (IMT Na, K, and Cl) is comprised of four electrodes (one
ion selective electrode Na+, K+, Cl- respectively) and one reference electrode.
Materials needed for the A-LYTE ® Integrated Multisensor (IMT, Na, K, and Cl) system but
distributed separately include the A-LYTE IMT Standard A & Standard B + Salt-Bridge, A-
LYTE IMT Diluent and A-LYTE IMT Diluent Check.
B Principle of Operation:
The A-LYTE® Integrated Multisensor (Na, K, Cl) uses indirect Integrated Multisensor
Technology (IMT). There are four electrodes used to measure electrolytes. Three of these
electrodes are ion selective for sodium, potassium and chloride. A reference electrode is also
incorporated in the multisensory.
K222438 - Page 2 of 15

--- Page 3 ---
During the testing, a diluted sample is delivered to the sensor and Na+, K+, Cl- ions establish
equilibrium with the electrode surface. A potential is generated proportional to the logarithm of
the analyte activity in the sample. The electrical potential generated on a sample is compared to
the electrical potential generated on a standard solution, and the concentration of the desired ions
is calculated by use of the Nernst equation.
The Atellica CI IMT system performs a two points automatic calibration in duplicate every 4
hours. In addition, the system will routinely perform a one point calibration check with each
sample measurement. Auto-calibration occurs after power on, with the changing of standards A,
B, or a sensor and when the system software is reset.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision
The precision study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3. Repeatability (within
run) and within-laboratory precision for Na+, K+ and Cl- were evaluated using quality control
samples and native samples. Each sample was assayed in duplicate per run, two (2) runs per
day for twenty (20) days using one (1) lot of reagent and one (1) instrument (N=80 for each
sample). Repeatability and within-lab precision were calculated and summarized below. The
within-lab precision includes the within-run (repeatability), between-run, and between-day
variance components.

2. Linearity:
The linearity studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI guideline
EP06 2nd Edition. For each analyte, nine (9) equally spaced samples were prepared by mixing
high and low concentration samples to cover the claimed measurement range. Five (5)
replicates were measured for each sample using one (1) instrument and one (1) reagent lot.
The mean of these replicates was compared to the expected values and the results of
weighted linear (for Na, K serum and urine) or ordinary (for Cl serum and urine) linear
regressions are summarized in the table below:

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed following the recommendations in the CLSI guideline
EP07 3rd edition to determine the effects from potential endogenous and exogenous
substances on the sensor performance using urine and serum samples. In this study, samples
with high and low analyte levels were divided into two groups: i.e., test sample (with added
interferent) and control sample (with no added interferent). Each test sample and control
sample was assayed in five (5) replicates with one (1) reagent lot on one (1) instrument.
The sponsor defines that interference is considered non-significant if the bias between the
test and control sample are within ± 10% for all tested interferences. The highest
concentration tested that showed non-significant interference are summarized below:

The sponsor added the following limitations in the package insert:
• Avoid hemolyzed samples for potassium. Hemolyzed samples may give incorrect
elevated potassium. Intracellular potassium concentration is 30-50-fold greater than that
of extracellular serum or plasma.
• Samples exposed to benzalkonium salts present in certain blood catheter devices will
cause falsely elevated sodium and potassium measurements.*

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The A-LYTE Na assay is traceable to a flame emission spectrophotometry reference method,
which uses reference materials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST), via patient sample correlation and is verified using NIST Reference Serum.
The A-LYTE K assay is traceable to a flame emission spectrophotometry reference method,
which uses reference materials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST), via patient sample correlation and is verified using NIST Reference Serum.
The A-LYTE Cl assay is traceable to a colorimetric reference method, which uses reference
materials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), via patient sample
correlation and is verified using NIST Reference Serum.
Stability
The A-LYTE® Integrated Multisensor (Na, K, Cl) is stable for 14 days on board or for testing
up to 5000 samples per sensor, whichever comes first.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantification (LoQ) were
evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB was determined non-parametrically by running four (4) blank samples in five (5)
replicates per sample for three (3) days on three (3) instruments. The LoD was determined
parametrically by running four (4) low samples of each sample type in five (5) replicates per
sample for three (3) days on three (3) instruments. LoQ was determined by testing four (4)
low samples of each sample type in five (5) replicates per sample for three (3) days on three
(3) instruments. The results are summarized in the table below:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were performed following the CLSI guideline EP09c 3rd edition.
Patient samples for each sample type, i.e., serum and urine, were each tested on the predicate
test system (x) and on the candidate test system. Two replicates were processed for each
sample on both systems. The first replicate results were used in statistical analyses.

It is documented in the literature that potassium concentrations in plasma specimens can be
lower than in serum specimens as a consequence of platelet rupture during coagulation. The
extent of the potential difference is dependent on the platelet count in the specimen. The
lower potassium reference intervals for plasma specimens compared to serum specimens
reflect this known occurrence.
