III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Atellica® CH Phencyclidine (Pcp) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the qualitative or
semiquantitative analyses of phencyclidine in human urine using the Atellica® CI Analyzer,
using a cutoff of 25 ng/mL. The Pcp assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A
more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. The
semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate
dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug-of-abuse test
result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
The Atellica® CH Vancomycin (Vanc) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative
measurement of vancomycin in human serum and plasma (lithium heparin) using the Atellica®
CI Analyzer. Vanc test results may be used in the diagnosis and treatment of vancomycin
overdose and in monitoring levels of vancomycin to ensure appropriate therapy.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The device is intended for in vitro diagnotic use only.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Atellica® CI Analyzer

Phencyclidine labeled with bacterial G6PDH; Tris buffer; bovine serum albumin; stabilizers;
preservatives.
The assay uses previously cleared Emit Calibrator/Control materials (k993755) that are not
supplied in this kit.
The Atellica® CH Vanc assay is comprised of the following:
Pack 1 (P1):
Atellica CH Vanc Reagent 1 (Well 1): Particle reagent
Atellica CH Vanc Reagent 3 (Well 2): Buffer
K222439 - Page 2 of 15

--- Page 3 ---
Pack 2 (P2):
One well of Atellica CH Vanc Reagent 2: Antibody (mouse monoclonal)
Materials needed but not supplied with the reagent kit include Atellica CH DRUG CAL II
calibrators, level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4, and level 5.
B Principle of Operation:
The Atellica® CH Pcp assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay based on competition
between drug present in the specimen and drug labeled-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(PCP-G6PDH) for antibodies raised to PCP. PCP-G6PDH activity decreases upon binding to the
anti-PCP antibodies and free PCP in the specimen competitively prevents this binding, so that
PCP-G6PDH enzyme activity is proportional to drug concentration in the specimen. Active PCP-
G6PDH enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH in the presence
of glucose-6-phosphate, resulting in an absorbance change that is measured
spectrophotometrically at 340/410 nm.
The Atellica® CH Vanc assay is based on a homogeneous particle enhanced turbidimetric
inhibition immunoassay (PETINIA) technique which uses a synthetic particle-vancomycin
conjugate (PR) and monoclonal vancomycin specific antibody (Ab). Vancomycin present in the
sample competes with vancomycin on the particles for available antibody, thereby decreasing the
rate of aggregation. Hence, the rate of aggregation is inversely proportional to the concentration
of vancomycin in the sample. The rate of aggregation is measured using bichromatic
turbidimetric readings at 545 and 694 nm.

Urine samples were spiked with Pcp concentrations ranging from 4.0 - 80.0 ng/mL and tested
with 6 replicates in the same analytical run using one reagent lot. For each known
concentration, drug recovery was calculated using the mean concentration of the replicates.
The data support the semi-quantitative reportable range of 5 - 75 ng/mL. The data are
summarized below.

Atellica CH Vanc
Linearity was evaluated based upon recommendations in CLSI EP06-A, second edition using
9 serum samples which spanned the assay measuring interval (2.5, 9.1, 15.7, 22.3, 29.0, 35.6,
42.2, 48.8, 55.4 μg/mL), 5 replicates per sample and 1 reagent lot. The mean of these
replicates was used for the ordinary linear regression analysis. The deviation from linearity
did not exceed 10% for each level. The result of the linear regression analysis is summarized
below.
y= 0.9977x+0.1988, r=0.9998
The results support the Atellica CH Vanc assay is linear from 3.0-50 μg/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Specific Gravity and pH for Pcp
The specific gravity of drug-free urine samples was adjusted to obtain the following values:
1.000, 1.002, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025 and 1.030 in the presence of Pcp at +/- 25%
of the cutoff concentration (19 ng/mL and 31 ng/mL, respectively). No interference was
observed in the urine samples with the tested specific gravity range from 1.000 to 1.030.
The pH of drug-free urine was titrated from 3.0 to 11.0 (+/- 0.2) in increments of 1 pH unit in
the presence of Pcp at +/- 25% of the cutoff concentration (19 ng/mL and 31 ng/mL,
respectively). The pH range tested from 3 to 10 did not affect the results of the Atellica CH
Pcp. A pH of 11 led to negative results of the Atellica CH Pcp at +25% of the cutoff.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
Atellica CH Vanc
See Section A.2. – Linearity above, measuring interval for Vanc is 3.0-50 μg/mL.
Dilution studies are based upon recommendations in CLSI EP34. Manual dilution of 2x
increases the upper end of the measuring interval from 50.0 μg/mL to 100.0 μg/L for 5
human spiked serum samples. Using CH Diluent, 2-fold manual dilutions of serum samples
above the extended assay range were processed with 20 replicates across two independent
operators in one instrument using one reagent lot. For automated dilution studies, the dilution
recovery results with 2-fold dilution demonstrate an extended measuring interval up to 100.0
μg/mL using the automated dilution routine with 5 replicates per sample in 1 reagent lot, 2
instruments. Data support an extended measuring interval of 3.0 - 100.0 μg/mL.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The Atellica CH Pcp assay is traceable to commercially available standards.
The Atellica CH Vanc assay is traceable to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) material.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were tested based upon
recommendations in CLSI guideline EP17-A2. The LoB study was performed by testing 5
drug free serum samples with 5 replicates per sample on 3 reagent lots for 3 days, on 1
instrument. LoB was determined using the 95% nonparametric percentile of the replicates for
each of three reagent lots. The claimed LoB for the Atellica CH Vanc assay is 0.6 μg/mL (0.4
μmol/L).
For LoD, 5 low samples were prepared from a base serum spiked with a vancomycin spiking
solution. Samples were processed with 5 replicates per sample on 3 reagent lots for 3 days,
on 1 instrument. LoD was determined parametrically using the pooled standard deviation
(SD ) for all samples from a given reagent lot. The maximum observed LoD across the 3 lots
L
was 0.7 μg/mL and the claimed LoD for the Atellica CH Vanc assay is 1.0 μg/mL (0.7
μmol/L).
For LoQ, 5 spiked serum samples were used with 5 replicates per sample on 3 reagent lots
for 3 days, on 1 instrument. The LoQ corresponds to the lowest amount of analyte in a
sample that can be accurately quantitated with a total allowable error of ≤ 20%. The
maximum observed LoQ across all reagent lots was determined to be 2.7 μg/mL and the
claimed LoQ for the Atellica CH Vanc assay is 3.0 μg/mL (2.1 μmol/L).
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The Atellica® CH Phencyclidine (Pcp) assay in the qualitative analysis’s mode uses a cutoff
of 25 ng/mL.
