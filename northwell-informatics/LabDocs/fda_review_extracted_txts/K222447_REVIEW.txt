--- Page 3 ---
The following special conditions for use statements apply to both the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash
Glucose Monitoring System and the FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System:
• Do not use the System if you are on dialysis or critically ill. The System is not cleared for
use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or medications common
to these populations may affect performance of the System.
• Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: If you are
experiencing symptoms that are not consistent with your glucose readings, consult your
health care professional.
• Do not use the System in people less than 2 years of age. The System is not cleared for
use in people under 2 years of age.
• The system is intended for use by a single person. It must not be used by more than one
person due to the risk of misinterpreting glucose information.
• Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the
"check blood glucose" symbol during the first 12 hours of wearing a Sensor. In addition,
use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions, if your Sensor
glucose reading does not match how you feel, or if the reading does not include a
number.
• Store the Sensor Kit between 36 °F and 82 °F. Storage outside of this range may cause
inaccurate Sensor glucose readings. If you suspect that the temperature may exceed 82 °F
(for example, in an un-airconditioned home in summer), you should refrigerate your
Sensor Kit. Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.
• Use of the Sensor with devices, apps, and software that are not listed (as compatible) may
cause inaccurate glucose readings.
• Do not force close the App. The App must be running in the background to receive
alarms. If you force close the App you will not receive alarms. Re-open the App to ensure
you will receive alarms.
The following special conditions for use statements apply to the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The subject devices are the FreeStyle Libre 2 (FSL2) Flash Glucose Monitoring System and the
FreeStyle Libre 3 (FSL3) Continuous Glucose Monitoring System with a modified sensor tail
design, henceforth also referred to as ‘modified FSL2 System’ and ‘modified FSL3 System’. The
subject devices include a modified subcutaneously inserted sensor tail of the previously cleared
systems to reduce ascorbic acid (vitamin C) interference. The subject devices are also compatible
with the Libre Data Sharing API cleared in K223537.
FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System
The FreeStyle Libre 2 (FSL2) Flash Glucose Monitoring System with a modified sensor tail
design, henceforth also referred to as ‘modified FSL2 System’, is an integrated continuous
glucose monitoring (iCGM) systems that perform continuous glucose measurements every
minute to provide glucose levels, trends, and real-time alarms capability to aid in the
management of diabetes. The modified FSL2 System requires a prescription, is intended for
home use, and consists of the following components:
FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor
• The Sensor is single use, disposable, and powered by a silver oxide battery. The Sensor
continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and has an 8-hour
memory capacity. The Sensor is factory calibrated, does not require fingerstick
calibration, and can be worn for up to 15 days.
FreeStyle Libre 2 Reader
• The Reader is a small handheld device that uses near field communication (NFC) to start
new Sensors and to scan Sensors to display and record data. The Reader uses Bluetooth
low energy (BLE) communication to issue alarms that notify the user to scan his/her
sensor when glucose values pass a high or low glucose threshold. The Reader also has a
built-in strip port with blood glucose functionality (that is intended to work with the
FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose test strips, cleared under K171941), and a user
interface that includes event logging features.
FreeStyle Libre 2 App (iOS and Android)
• When downloaded to a compatible smartphone, the App uses NFC communication to
start new Sensors and to scan Sensors to display and record data and uses BLE
communication to issue alarms. The FreeStyle Libre 2 App allows connectivity with
K222447 - Page 4 of 26

--- Page 5 ---
cloud-based applications. The FreeStyle Libre 2 App is an alternative primary display for
the System and does not interact with the Reader. The FreeStyle Libre 2 App is
distributed using the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, and a list of compatible
devices is accessible in the App via the Help feature or product website.
FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System
The FreeStyle Libre 3 (FSL3) Glucose Monitoring System with a modified sensor tail design,
henceforth also referred to as ‘modified FSL3 System’, is an integrated continuous glucose
monitoring (iCGM) systems that perform continuous glucose measurements every minute to
provide glucose levels, trends, and real-time alarms capability to aid in the management of
diabetes. The modified FSL3 System requires a prescription, is intended for home use, and
consists of the following components:
FreeStyle Libre 3 Sensor
• The Sensor is single use, disposable, and powered by a silver oxide battery. The Sensor
continuously measures glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and has a 15-day
memory capacity. The Sensor is factory calibrated, does not require fingerstick
calibration, and can be worn for up to 15 days.

Store and a list of compatible devices is accessible in the App via the Help feature or
product website.
B Principle of Operation:
The modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System and the modified FreeStyle
Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System use an electrochemical sensor to monitor
glucose levels in the interstitial fluid (ISF). The sensor is held in place with an adhesive pad and
incorporates both the subcutaneously implanted sensor and associated electronics. The sensor
uses a glucose oxidase enzyme to oxidize glucose and transfer electrons to an electrode,
producing a current. The strength of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present
in the ISF. The system converts the electrical current signal to a glucose value (in mg/dL)
accompanied by trend arrow for display to the user on a display device.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
The FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is physically identical to the
predicate FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System except for the differences in
sensor transmission dimensions as previously established in K212132. Therefore, the pivotal
clinical studies for the modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System were
leveraged for the modified FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
iCGM performance was evaluated in clinical studies described below in section C(3).
Subjects wore two modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash sensors concurrently, one on the back of
each upper arm, to evaluate device precision.
In the study for 18 years and older, the mean paired absolute relative difference (between
the 2 concurrently worn devices) was 8.0 %; and the mean coefficient of variation (mean
%CV) was 5.6 %.
For pediatric age 6 to 17 years, the mean paired absolute relative difference was 8.6 %; and
the mean %CV was 6.1 %.
For pediatric age 2 to 5 years old, the mean paired absolute relative difference was 6.5%; and
the mean %CV was 4.6 %.

2. Linearity:
The reportable range for the modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash System and FreeStyle Libre 3
Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is 40 to 400 mg/dL. Data supporting this claimed
measuring range was generated in the clinical study described in Section C(3) below.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was shown to significantly interfere with system performance of
the predicate device.
A clinical study was conducted to evaluate ascorbic acid interference for the modified
FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash System. This was a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study that
enrolled 60 subjects at 2 sites. The study was designed to evaluate performance of the system
in people with diabetes (age 18 and older) taking ascorbic acid. Each subject wore two
sensors, one on the back of each upper arm, for a period of up to 10 days. The sensors were
from a single production lot.
The interference effect of ascorbic acid on the modified Freestyle Libre 2 Flash System was
assessed by the difference (mg/dL) between CGM and comparator method (CM), in this case
the Yellow Springs Instrument Life Sciences 2300 STAT Plus™ Glucose and Lactate
Analyzer, readings at baseline and after each ascorbic acid doses. In this study, maximum
bias was observed approximately 2 to 3 hours after each ascorbic acid dose.
The maximum average interference bias was 5.1 mg/dL after one 1000 mg dose. The
maximum average total interference biases were 9.2 mg/dL and 9.0 mg/dL (vs. baseline)
after the second and third 1000 mg doses (given every 4 hours), respectively.
Based on data from the clinical interference study, the sponsor included the following
statement in the User Guide:
“Interfering Substances: Taking more than 1000 mg of Vitamin C per day may falsely
raise your Sensor readings, which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event.

Vitamin C can be found in supplements including multivitamins and cold remedies such
as Airborne® and Emergen-C®. See your health care professional to understand how
long Vitamin C is active in your body.
Additional Notes for Health Care Professionals: In the original version of the FreeStyle
Libre 2 system, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) doses of larger than 500 mg per day could
affect the Sensor readings, making them look higher than they really were. With the
current version of the FreeStyle Libre 2 System, users can take up to 1000 mg of ascorbic
acid per day and can still use the Sensor readings to make treatment decisions.”
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range for modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System and
the modified FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is 40 to 400 mg/dL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The storage shelf-life of 9 months at 36 to 82 °F within the humidity range of 10 % - 90 %
previously established for the predicate FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash sensor in K193371 is
applicable to the modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash sensor.
The storage shelf-life of 3 months at 36 to 82 °F within the humidity range of 10 % - 90 %
previously established for the reference FreeStyle Libre 3 sensor in K212132 is applicable to
the modified FreeStyle Libre 3 sensor.
6. Detection Limit:
If a glucose measurement is less than 40 mg/dL, the result will be displayed by the system as
‘LO’. If the glucose measurement exceeds 400 mg/dL, the result will be displayed as ‘HI’.
Data supporting this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study
described in Section C(3) below.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
The accuracy performance of the modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring
System was assessed in a single pivotal clinical study conducted in the United States at seven
centers.
The study enrolled 150 subjects (18 years and older) with diabetes (85.3% with Type 1
diabetes and 14.7% with insulin-requiring Type 2 diabetes). Subjects wore two sensors for up
to 16 consecutive days following Sensor application and accuracy analysis is based on the
first applied sensor to each subject only. Subjects took part in up to three ten-hour clinical
sessions that took place during four distinct periods: Days 1 to 3; Days 5 to 7; Days 9 to 11,
and Days 13 to 15. During each clinic session, each subject’s glucose was manipulated to
observe data spanning the measuring range.
The study also enrolled 142 pediatric subjects with Type 1 diabetes. Subjects wore two
sensors for up to 16 consecutive days following Sensor application and accuracy analysis is
based on the first applied sensor to each subject only. Subjects age 2 to 5 years took part in
one four-hour clinical session. Subjects age 6 to 12 years took part in one twelve-hour
clinical session. Subjects age 13 to 17 years took part in two twelve-hour clinical sessions.
Clinic sessions for each subject took place during four distinct periods: Days 1 to 3; Days 5
to 7; Days 9 to 11, and Days 13 to 15. During each clinic session, glucose levels were
manipulated in subjects 11 years and older to observe data spanning the measuring range.
Subjects 10 years and younger underwent observation only without glucose manipulation.
The modified FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated by
comparing iCGM glucose values to glucose values from venous blood draws measured with
an FDA-cleared laboratory grade comparator method (YSI 2300) subjects 6 years and older,
and glucose values from capillary blood measured with a self-monitoring blood glucose
meter (SMBG) for subjects 2 to 5 years of age.
Glucose values were obtained from the system and from the comparator at the same or
similar time. In both studies, absolute differences in mg/dL of values compared to the
comparator method were calculated for all values below 70 mg/dL. For values of 70 mg/dL
K222447 - Page 11 of 26

--- Page 12 ---
and above, percentage differences compared to the comparator method were calculated.

Trend Accuracy
Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose
and is characterized by slopes, such as from > 2mg/dL/min to < -2 mg/dL/min. Trend
accuracy was assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change from the iCGM
and the corresponding comparator values for each iCGM-comparator measurement pair.

Agreement When iCGM Reads ‘LO’ or ‘HI’
The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System reports glucose readings between
40 and 400 mg/dL. When the system determines that the glucose reading is below 40 mg/dL,
it will display ‘LO’ whenever the sensor is scanned. When the system determines that the
glucose reading is above 400 mg/dL, it will display ‘HI’ whenever the sensor is scanned.
Because the system does not display glucose values below 40 mg/dL or above 400 mg/dL,
the comparisons to the actual blood glucose levels (as determined by the comparator) when
the iCGM value is classified as ‘LO’ or ‘HI’ are evaluated separately. The cumulative
percentages of when the comparator values were less than certain glucose values (for ‘LO’)
and when comparator values were more that certain glucose values (for ‘HI’) are presented in
the tables below.

Alarm Performance
The tables in this section show the accuracy of the System’s Low and High Glucose Alarms.
The Alarm Rate tells the user how often the alarm is right or wrong. The Detection Rate tells
the user how often the System is able to recognize and notify the user about a low or high
glucose event (within 15 minutes before or after the event).

Sensor Stability
Sensor stability describes the performance of the sensor over the sensor lifetime. Sensors can
be worn for up to 14 days. Performance was estimated by calculating the mean of the
absolute relative differences between iCGM and comparator measurement and percentage of
device readings within 15 mg/dL or 15 % (15/15%), 20 mg/dL or 20 % (20/20%) and 40
mg/dL or 40 % (40/40%) of the comparator values during the beginning, early middle, late
middle, and end of the wear period. These times were defined as follows:
• Beginning (Days 1, 2 or 3)

Software
Software regression testing was conducted in accordance with established specifications and IEC
62304 and documentation was provided as recommended by FDA Guidance "Guidance for the
Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices", published May
11, 2005. The test results met acceptance criteria and support that the subject devices are
acceptable for their intended use.
Interoperability
The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System and FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous
Glucose Monitoring System include the Libre Data Sharing API (cleared in K223537) to
communicate iCGM data with authorized client software. The sponsor developed an approach
for interoperability in alignment with FDA guidance, “Design Considerations and Pre-market
Submission Recommendations for Interoperable Medical Devices,” published September 6,
2017. The approach to interoperability with authorized partners provides information to support
device expectations, requirements, development methodology, testing protocols for their
software integration, and interface specifications for data exchange with compatible
interoperable devices, including automated insulin dosing (AID) systems.
As standalone iCGMs, the first 12 hours of sensor wear for the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose
Monitoring System and FreeStyle Libre 3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is intended to
be adjunctive. The sponsor includes a “Check Blood Glucose” icon in the user interface to
remind users to use a blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions. Authorized
partners should consider the sensor performance throughout the duration of device wear with
particular consideration during the first 12 hours of adjunctive use.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
