*6.40W is the Window-based version of 6.40A
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
BD BACTEC Myco/F Lytic culture medium is a Middlebrook 7H9 and Brain Heart Infusion
broth formulation for the recovery of mycobacteria from blood specimens, and yeast and fungi
from blood and sterile body fluids. Specific modifications were made to enhance the growth and
recovery of mycobacteria, yeast and fungi. These modifications include ferric ammonium citrate
to provide an iron source for specific strains of mycobacteria and fungi, the addition of saponin as a blood
lysing agent, and the addition of specific proteins and sugars to provide nutritional
supplements. Each vial contains a sensor which can detect decreases in oxygen concentration in
the vial resulting from microorganism metabolism and growth. The sensor is monitored by the
BD BACTEC fluorescent series instrument for increasing fluorescence, which is due to the
decrease in oxygen. A positive determination indicates the presumptive presence of viable
microorganisms in the vial.
BD BACTEC Myco/F Lytic Culture Vials are supplied in a carton containing 50 vials. It is a nonsterile
product.
B Principle of Operation:
The BD BACTEC Myco/F Lytic Culture Vial is designed for the rapid detection of mycobacteria
in blood, and yeast and fungi in blood and sterile body fluids. Specimens are inoculated into the
BD BACTEC Myco/F Lytic vial either with a syringe or direct draw with a needle and tubing.
The vial is placed into the BD BACTEC fluorescent series instrument and is continuously

agitated and incubated at 35°C for maximum recovery. The default testing protocol is 42 days.
The recommended testing protocols for the following organisms are: 7 days for yeast, 30 days for
filamentous fungi, and 42 days for mycobacteria and dimorphic fungi. Each vial contains a sensor which
can detect decreases in oxygen concentration in the vial resulting from microorganism metabolism and
growth. The sensor is monitored by the BD BACTEC fluorescent series instrument every ten minutes.
Analysis of the rate of oxygen decrease as measured by increasing fluorescence enables the BD BACTEC
fluorescent series instrument to determine if the vial is instrument positive. A positive determination
indicates the presumptive presence of viable microorganisms in the vial. Detection is limited to
microorganisms that will grow in the medium at 35 °C. The medium is not selective and will support the
growth of other aerobic organisms including bacteria which may interfere, if present, with the recovery of
slower growing mycobacteria, yeast and fungi. Culture vials which remain negative after the completion
of protocol, and which show no visible sign of positivity are removed from the instrument and
sterilized prior to discarding. This qualitative culture functions as an aid to diagnosis and is
automated on the BD BACTEC fluorescent series instrument.

The MDL study with blood demonstrated that the plastic device performed equivalently based on a value
of close to 1 or higher when compared to the predicate glass device at low target inoculum levels for all
organisms with the exception of Blastomyces dermatitidis. The Blastomyces dermatitidis resulted in a
ratio of positive yields of 0.33. The culture medium of BD BACTEC Myco/F Lytic displays inconsistent
growth of Blastomyces dermatitidis. Information about this organism was noted as a limitation in the

media to detect low numbers of organisms (expected target level of 0-1 and 1- 10 CFU/vial) when
present in sterile body fluid (pleural, synovial, and cerebrospinal). Five organisms (1 filamentous
fungi, 2 yeast, and 2 dimorphic fungi strains) were tested with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and three
organisms (1 filamentous fungi and 2 yeast strains) were tested with pleural and synovial fluid at four
sterile body fluid volumes (0.5, 1, 3 and 5 mL), each with two inoculum levels of 0-1 and 1-10 CFU/vial
and across three lots by one instrument (BACTEC FX).
3 organisms x 3 lots x 4 SBF volumes x 2 inoculum levels x 1 instrument x 2 SBF (pleural &
synovial fluid) = 144 paired vials
5 organisms x 3 lots x 4 SBF volumes x 2 inoculum levels x 1 instrument x 1 SBF
(cerebrospinal fluid) = 120 paired vials
Total =264 paired vials
The ratio of positive yields was calculated to assess performance. The detection results of 0-1 and 1-10
CFU/vial were evaluated for each organism and organism group (mycobacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi,
and dimorphic fungi), as shown in Table 6.

The MDL study with sterile body fluid demonstrated that the modified plastic device performed
equivalently based on a value of 1 or higher when compared to the predicate glass device at low
target inoculum levels for all organisms with the exception of Blastomyces dermatitidis. The
Blastomyces dermatitidis resulted in a ratio of positive yields of 0.86. The culture medium of BD
BACTEC Myco/F Lytic displays inconsistent growth of Blastomyces dermatitidis at low target
inoculum of 0-1 or 1-10 CFU/vial. Information about this organism was noted as a limitation in
the product insert.

8. Delayed Entry in blood for Mycobacteria
As a way to assess the potential effects from delay which may occur in practice, an internal
study was conducted to evaluate the effect of recovery, from the time the plastic Myco/F
Lytic culture vial was inoculated, to the time the vial was placed on the instrument. This
seeded study was conducted using three lots of the plastic Myco/ F Lytic culture vials. The
delayed vial entry study was conducted using the following mycobacterium at target
concentrations of 10-100 CFU/vial: Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium bovis,
Mycobacterium chimaera, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium intracellulare,
Mycobacterium kansasii, and 2 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Vials were prepared
in 1-, 3-, and 5-mL human blood. All samples were held at the specified temperatures and
times prior to loading into the BD BACTEC fluorescent instrument. Percent recovery and
Time-To-Detection reflects time to positive flagged by the instrument. The study
demonstrated that all delayed entry conditions showed 100% percent recovery of the 8 strains
of mycobacterium evaluated. These results are acceptable. Study results are presented in Table 7
below.

bottle receipt by the laboratory, delayed entry information is provided from seeded studies for
mycobacterium in the ‘Expected Values and Specific Performance Characteristics (Blood
Cultures)’ section. Medium has not been evaluated for delayed vial entry for yeast, fungi, or

B Comparison Studies:
Performance of the BD BACTEC Myco/F Lytic Culture Vial (plastic) was evaluated in seeded
internal analytical studies to demonstrate comparable performance to the predicate device, the BD
BACTEC Myco/F Lytic Culture Vial (glass). Comparison results were acceptable. The
comparisons were made using the following parameters: time to detection, percent recovery, false
negative rate, and false positive rate.
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Instrument Time to Detection (TTD) study in blood
The TTD (in hours) was recorded as part of the combined Percent Recovery and the Microbial
Detection Limit studies using the BD BACTEC FX at three inoculum levels,
across three blood volumes (1 mL, 3 mL and 5 mL) over three media lots. The Percent
Recovery study represented by the standard inoculum of 10 to 100 CFU per vial and the
Microbial Detection Limit study represented by the challenge inoculum levels of 0 to 1 and 1
to 10 CFU per vial.
The data was analyzed using the 95% confidence interval with the bootstrap method. The
TTD data was stratified by organism group, target inoculum level, and blood volume. The
results are shown in Table 8.
The TTD study demonstrated that the plastic device performed equivalently when compared
to the predicate glass device when stratified by organism group (Dimorphic Fungi,
Filamentous, Fungi, Yeast and Mycobacteria), inoculum concentration (0-1, 1-10, 10-100),
and blood volume (1 mL, 3 mL and 5 mL). The results show that the test vial performed
equivalently to or better than the predicate vial for all conditions, with the exception of
Dimorphic Fungi at an inoculum concentration of 0-1 CFU/vial at 1 mL blood volume and
Mycobacteria at an inoculum concentration of 1-10 CFU/vial and blood volume of 1mL. The
data was statistically analyzed by means of 95% CI with the bootstrap method, where the
95% CI for equivalent median detection times versus the predicate vial contains zero and the
95% CI for median detection times shorter than the predicate contains only negative values.

Instrument Time to Detection (TTD) study in SBF
The TTD (in hours) was recorded as part of the combined Percent Recovery and the
Microbial Detection Limit studies using the BD BACTEC FX at three inoculum levels, three
sterile body fluid types (pleural, synovial, and cerebrospinal) across four sterile body fluid
volumes (0.5 mL, 1 mL, 3 mL and 5 mL) over three media lots. The Percent Recovery study
represented by the standard inoculum of 10 to 100 CFU per vial and the Microbial Detection
Limit study represented by the challenge inoculum levels of 0 to 1 and 1 to 10 CFU per vial.
The data was analyzed using the 95% confidence interval with the bootstrap method. The
TTD data was stratified by target inoculum level, sterile body fluid volume or organism. The
results are shown in Table 9.
The TTD study demonstrated that the plastic device performed equivalently when compared
to the predicate glass device when stratified by organism group (Dimorphic Fungi,
Filamentous, Fungi, and Yeast), inoculum concentration (0-1, 1-10, 10-100), and sterile body

fluid volume (0.5 mL, 1 mL, 3 mL and 5 mL). The results show that the test vial performed
equivalently to or better than the predicate vial for all conditions, with the exception of
Dimorphic Fungi under some test conditions. The data was statistically analyzed by means of
95% CI with the bootstrap method, where the 95% CI for equivalent median detection times
versus the predicate vial contains zero and the 95% CI for the median detection times shorter
than the predicate contains only negative values.

Percent Recovery (Detection) Study in Blood
The percent recovery (detection) was evaluated in a study of 207 paired sets at the standard
inoculum level of 10 to 100 CFU/vial on one instrument across three lots using a diverse set
of microorganisms frequently isolated in blood. The study included 23 microorganisms (8
mycobacteria, 10 yeast, 3 filamentous fungi, and 2 dimorphic fungi strains) tested at three
blood volumes (1, 3 and 5 mL).
23 organisms x 3 lots x 3 blood volumes x 1 instrument= 207 paired sets
The performance of each organism type (mycobacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and
dimorphic fungi) at inoculum of 10 to 100 CFU per vial are shown in Table 10 – Table 13.

Of the 207 paired sets, 206 sets recovered organisms in both the plastic vial and the predicate
glass vial. In only one paired set was there a single negative result between the plastic vial
and predicate glass vial. The single negative result was in the plastic vial inoculated with
Blastomyces dermatitidis with 1 mL blood. The culture medium of BD BACTEC Myco/F
Lytic displays inconsistent growth of Blastomyces dermatitidis. Information about this
organism was noted as a limitation in the product insert.
Percent Recovery (Detection) Study in SBF
The percent recovery (detection) was evaluated in a study of 207 paired sets at the standard
inoculum level of 10 to 100 CFU/vial on one instrument across three lots using
microorganisms frequently isolated in sterile body fluid. Five microorganisms (1 filamentous
fungi, 2 yeast, and 2 dimorphic fungi strains) were tested with cerebrospinal fluid and three
organisms (1 filamentous fungi, and 2 yeast strains) were tested with pleural and synovial
fluid at four sterile body fluid volumes (0.5, 1, 3 and 5 mL).

Of the 132 paired sets, 131 sets recovered organisms in both the plastic vial and the predicate glass vial.
In only one paired set was there a single negative result between the plastic vial and predicate glass vial.
The single negative result was in the glass vial inoculated with Candida auris.
False Positive Rate (Instrument-positive, subculture-negative) in Blood
False positive was defined as instrument positive but subculture negative in the evaluation.
False positivity was assessed with vials inoculated with fresh blood of 3, 5, and 7 mL, but no organisms
were added to the vials. There were a total of 144 paired sets across three lots using BACTEC FX and
BACTEC 9240 and completed at the default 42-day protocol.
8 vials x 3 blood volumes x 3 lots x 2 instruments= 144* paired sets
*Note: One lot pair with 7mL blood was excluded due to contamination resulting in 143 paired vials.
There were no false positives observed for the plastic vials with 1 mL and 5 mL fresh blood.
There was one false positive observed for the plastic vials with 7 mL fresh blood. There were
no false positives observed for the predicate (glass) vial in 1 mL fresh blood. There were two
false positives observed for the predicate (glass) vial in 5 mL of fresh blood and thirty-five
observed in 7 mL of fresh blood. Majority of the false positives were observed in the higher
blood volumes. The false positive rate for the plastic vial for all fresh blood volume
combined was 0.70%, which is lower than the 25.87% for the predicate vials (glass). The
Myco/F Lytic plastic vials (test) therefore met the threshold of equivalent to or better than
Myco/F Lytic glass vials (predicate) performance. The Myco/F Lytic glass product insert
includes the following statement “false positivity most likely will increase when the blood
volume is above 5 mL” to address the high false positive rate at higher volume. This
limitation is also included in the plastic labeling. The False Positive Rates stratified by blood
volume is presented in Table 17.

False Positive Rates (Instrument-positive, subculture-negative) in Sterile Body Fluid
False positive was defined as instrument positive but subculture negative in the evaluation. False
positivity was assessed with vials inoculated with sterile body fluid of 0.5, 5, and 7 mL,
but no organisms were added to the vials. There were a total of 432 pair sets across three lots
using BACTEC FX and BACTEC 9240 and completed at the default 42-day protocol.
8 vials x 3 SBF volumes x 3 lots x 2 instruments* 3 SBF types= 432* paired sets
*Note: 15 vials (7 glass and 8 plastic) were excluded due to contamination resulting
in 425/424 paired vials.

A total of 432 vial pairs were inoculated with sterile body fluid. Fifteen vials were excluded
due to contamination. No false positives occurred in the test vial (plastic) or predicate vial
(glass) with 0.5 mL of any sterile body fluid. At the 5-mL sterile body fluid level there was
only a single false positive with synovial fluid in the predicate vial (glass). The 7-mL overfill
level produced four false positives, all with synovial fluid, three in the test vial (plastic) and
one in the predicate vial (glass). The false positive rate for all sterile body fluids combined
was 0.71% in the predicate vial (glass) and 0.47% in the test vial (plastic). The False Positive
Rates stratified by blood sterile body fluid volume and SBF type is presented in Table 18.

False Negative Rates (Instrument-negative, subculture-positive) in Blood
All inoculated paired sets (414 from the Recovery study + 205 from the Microbial Detection
Limit study =619 paired sets) that were instrument negative at the end of default protocol (42
days) were subcultured onto appropriate culture media plates. This combined data set was
evaluated for the false negative rates. A false negative is a vial that was instrument-negative
at the end of protocol yet contains viable organisms upon subculturing onto appropriate
culture media. A total of seven false negatives were identified from growth on sub-culture of
terminal negatives. Four were Blastomyces dermatitidis across a range of inoculum levels and blood
volumes, one in the predicate (glass) vial and three in the plastic vials. The remaining
three were Mycobacterium bovis at the 0-1 CFU target inoculum with 5 mL blood, two in the
predicate (glass) and one in the plastic vials. False negative rates for the predicate (glass) vial
and plastic vial were low and comparable based on a rate of 0.48% (3/619) and 0.65%
(4/619), respectively. The difference in false negative rates for Myco/F Lytic glass (predicate
vial) and Myco/F Lytic plastic vial (test vial) were not statistically significant. The False
Negative Rates for each vial type is presented in Table 19.

All inoculated paired sets (132 from the Recovery study + 264 from the Microbial Detection
Limit study =396 paired sets) that were instrument negative at the end of the default protocol
(42 days) were subcultured onto appropriate culture media plates. This combined data set was
evaluated for the false negative rates. A false negative is a vial that was instrument-negative
at the end of protocol yet contains viable organisms upon subculturing onto appropriate
culture media. A total of ten false negatives were identified from growth on sub-culture of
terminal negatives. All ten false negatives were dimorphic fungi (9 were H. capsulatum and
one Blastomyces dermatitidis) at the lower inoculum levels (0-1 or 1-10 CFU). False negative
rates for the predicate (glass) vial and plastic vial were comparable based on a rate of 1.01%
(4/396) and 1.52% (6/396), respectively. The difference in false negative rates for Myco/F
Lytic glass (predicate vial) and Myco/F Lytic plastic vial (test vial) were not statistically
significant. The False Negative Rates for each vial type is presented in Table 20.

BD BACTEC Instrument Compatibility Study
The BD BACTEC instrument compatibility study evaluated three lots of BD
BACTEC Myco/F Lytic Culture Vials (plastic) and three lots of BD BACTEC Myco/F Lytic
Culture Vials (glass) using four of the BACTEC fluorescent instruments (FX, FX-40, 9240,
and 9050). A total of 6 organisms (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium fortuitum,
Candida albicans, Candida auris, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus)
were evaluated at three different blood volumes (1 mL, 3mL and 5mL) and one target
inoculum concentration (10-100). The BACTEC instrument compatibility study Percent
