IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys reagent rackpack (M, R1, R2) consists of:
M: Streptavidin-coated microparticles (transparent cap), 1 bottle, 12 mL:
Streptavidin-coated microparticles 0.72 mg/mL; preservative.
R1: Tg~biotin (gray cap), 1 bottle, 10 mL:
Biotinylated Tg (human) 0.200 mg/L; TRIS buffer 100 mmol/L, pH 7.0; preservative.
R2: Anti Tg-Ab~Ru(bpy) (black cap), 1 bottle, 10 mL:
Monoclonal anti-Tg antibodies (human) labeled with ruthenium complex 0.620 mg/L;
TRIS buffer 100 mmol/L, pH 7.0; preservative.
The Elecsys Anti-Tg has been modified from the previously cleared format (K053426) to
decrease potential biotin interference in the assay. Briefly, free biotin in serum and plasma is
neutralized by the addition of a biotin-neutralizing antibody in reagents. The antibodies are
specific for free biotin and do not bind to, or interact with, the biotin-linker conjugates.
B Principle of Operation:
The Elecsys Anti-Tg assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay that makes use of a competitive
test principle and uses biotinylated Tg and a monoclonal Anti-Tg specific antibody labeled with
ruthenium complex.
K222610 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
The Elecsys Anti-Tg assay has an assay time of 18 minutes. During the first incubation, 10 μL of
sample is combined with a biotinylated-Tg and antibodies from the patient sample bind the Tg
antigen. During the second incubation, after the addition of anti-Tg antibodies labeled with
ruthenium complex and streptavidin-coated microparticles, the immunocomplex produced
becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture
is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the
surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell. The application of
voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a
photomultiplier. The results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-
specifically generated by a 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent
barcode or 2-barcode.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the Elecsys anti-Tg assay was assessed according to CLSI EP06-Ed2. Native
human serum samples and normal serum sample pools were used to create six dilution series
for a total of 26 concentration levels across the measuring range. The samples were assayed
in triplicate within a single run on the cobas e 411 analyzer. For each level, the mean of the
measured values, predicted value and the deviation from linearity were calculated. Predicted
values were calculated using a best fitted straight line by a weighted least squares linear
regression analysis. Percent deviations from linearity were calculated as differences between
the observed values (mean values) and the predicted values divided by the predicted values.
The results of the study were summarized in the following table:

* One mid-range sample gave a higher deviation from linearity of -15.05% and one sample on the
low end of the range gave a deviation from linearity of 11.28% which corresponded to a deviation
of 1.4 IU/mL. The deviation from linearity for the remaining samples were between -7.6% to
10.7%.
The results support the linearity of the claimed measuring interval (AMI): 15 – 4000 IU/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous Interference:
Potential interference from some endogenous substances was assessed using three native
serum pools with anti-Tg concentrations of low (~25 IU/mL), mid (~120 IU/mL), and high-
range (~3000 IU/mL). For difference substance interferent levels, each of the three samples
was further divided into two aliquots for a control sample (with no added interferent) and test
sample (with added interferent). The anti-Tg level in the test and control samples were
assayed in five replicates using one modified Elecsys anti-Tg reagent lot using one
instrument. For each interferent concentration level, the recovery was based on the mean of
the replicates of test sample value comparing to the control sample.
The results are summarized in the following table.

Tg 200 ng/mL 100 ng/mL
Exogenous Interference:
Interference from 17 common and 14 pharmaceutical drugs that might be used in the clinical
context of the assay’s intended use were assessed using two serum samples, one with a low
concentration of anti-Tg (~25 IU/mL) and one with a high concentration of anti-Tg (1500
IU/mL). The two samples were divided into aliquots and spiked with the potential
interferents or with solvent only. No significant interference (a recovery of 100% ± 10%) is
observed for the interferents at the concentrations tested in the table below.

Cross reactivity:
Potential cross-reactivity between anti-Tg and anti-TPO was assessed in a cross-reactivity
study. Two native human serum pools with anti-Tg concentrations of 26 IU/mL and 96
IU/mL were spiked with anti-TPO antibodies to a level of 1500 IU/mL and assessed using
one reagent lot of the modified Elecsys Anti-Tg and a cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer.
The average results from three replicates of the paired spiked human serum pools were
compared with the un-spiked human serum pool to determine the percent of cross reactivity.
Significant Cross Reactivity was defined as ≥10% Cross Reactivity between spiked and un-
spiked native human serum pools. The results demonstrate that there is no notable cross
reactivity between anti-Tg and anti-TPO (up to 1500 IU/ml) in the Elecsys Anti-Tg assay.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range for the Elecsys Anti-Tg assay is 15 – 4000 IU/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The Elecsys Anti-Tg assay is standardized against the NIBSC (National Institute for
Biological Standards and Control) 65/93 Standard.
Stability:
An on-board stability study of the modified assay reagents was performed using five
samples, including two native single serum samples and three native serum pools, across the

analyzer. The data support the package insert claim of 6 weeks on-board stability.
A stability study to determine the stability of opened reagents when stored at 2–8°C was
performed using five samples, including two native single serum samples and three native
serum pools, across the measuring range and tested at various time points with one lot of the
modified Elecsys Anti-Tg stored at 2–8°C for up to 50 days. The data support the package
insert claim of 6 weeks.
A real time stability study was performed to examine the long term stability of shelf-life of
the modified Elecsys Anti-Tg reagents when stored at 2–8°C. At various testing points, two
lots of PreciControl ThyroAB Level 1 and Level 2 controls were tested in triplicate on one
cobas e 411 using three lots of the modified Elecsys Anti-Tg reagents stored at 2–8°C. The
data support the package insert claim that the Elecsys Anti-Tg reagents are stable when
stored at 2–8°C for up to 15 months.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2.
Limit of Blank (LoB):
For determination of the LoB, the LoB was determined as the 95th percentile of blank sample
measurements. Briefly, an analyte-free native human serum sample was measured using
three reagent lots of the modified Elecsys Anti-Tg, one cobas e 411 analyzer, over the course
of six runs with 10-replicates per run, resulting in a total of 60 blank replicates per reagent
lot. The LoB determined in all three lots were less than the claimed LoB in the labeling, 9.0
IU/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
For the determination of the LoD, five low-level native human serum samples, including
three single native donors and two native sample pools, were measured in duplicate in six
runs, over six days, with three lots of the modified Elecsys Anti-Tg on one cobas e 411
analyzer. In total, 60 measured values of samples with low analyte concentrations were
obtained per lot. The LoD corresponds to the concentration determined by LoD = LoB +
1.653 x SD total (of low analyte samples). The LoD determined in all three lots were less
than the claimed LoD in the labeling, 10.0 IU/mL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ):
For the determination of LoQ, four low-level single native human serum samples were
measured in quintuplicate per run, one run per day for five days using three different lots of
the modified Elecsys Anti-Tg on one cobas e 411 analyzer, resulting in 25 replicates per
sample per lot. The LoQ was set as the lowest concentration of analyte that can be
reproducibly measured with a total error of ≤ 20% at ≤ 15 IU/mL. The LoQ determined in all
three lots were less than the claimed LoQ in the labeling, 15 IU/mL.

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix equivalency study to serum was conducted to support use of the Elecsys anti-Tg
assay on the cobas e 411 analyzer with the following sample matrices: Serum, dipotassium
(K2) EDTA plasma, and tripotassium (K3) EDTA plasma. In the study, at least 44
serum/plasma donor matched venous specimens were collected and evaluated. Each
specimen was tested in singlicate using one reagent lot of the modified Elecsys Anti-Tg. The
results were analyzed by Passing-Bablok regression with serum results as the reference (x-
axis). The results are summarized as follows:

D Clinical Cut-Off:
Refer to K053426.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The reference range of the modified Elecsys Anti-Tg was verified be the same as the reference
range of the predicate which was established based on a total of 391 healthy subjects and
confirmed the threshold value of 115 IU/mL (which corresponds to the 94th percentile).
The labeling of the Elecsys Anti-Tg includes the following statement: “Each laboratory should
investigate the transferability of the expected values to its own patient population and if
necessary determine its own reference ranges.”
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
