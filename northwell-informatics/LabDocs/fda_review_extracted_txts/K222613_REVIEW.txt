IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ARX Liquid Amies Collection & Transport System consists of a polypropylene screw-cap
vial containing Liquid Amies transport medium and three (3) sterile peel-open pouches
containing a pre-scored Microbrush nylon flocked swab for collecting specimens. The three (3)
nylon flocked swabs are provided with various score points, tip sizes, and configuration to
facilitate specimen collection from various sites on patients’ bodies. Nylon flocked swabs
facilitate quick absorption and release of clinical specimens. Proper specimen collection from the
patient is critical for successful isolation and identification of infectious organisms.
Amies liquid medium is a non-nutritive balanced salt solution containing inorganic phosphates to
provide buffering capability, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, and
magnesium chloride to provide essential ions that help maintain osmotic balance and control
permeability of bacterial cells. It also contains sodium thioglycolate to provide a reduced
environment. ARX Liquid Amies transport medium is capable of maintaining the viability of
aerobic, anaerobic, and fastidious bacteria (such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae) during specimen
transport to the laboratory for bacteriological testing and culture.
All raw materials used in the manufacture of ARX Liquid Amies Collection & Transport System
are qualified before use. Every batch of ARX Liquid Amies Collection & Transport System is
tested prior to release for sterility, pH, and background count using microscopic examination.
Representative samples of each batch are further evaluated for their ability to maintain the
viability of selected bacterial agents over predefined time periods.
B Principle of Operation:
Once a specimen is collected with a swab and added to the ARX liquid Amies transport medium
vial, it is immediately processed to achieve optimal recovery. For cases where immediate

processing (i.e., within 2 hours) is not possible, specimens are stored at 2–30°C and processed
within 48 hours (except for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which should be processed within 24 hours).

Shelf-life Stability:
Shelf-life stability of four (4) manufactured lots of ARX Liquid Amies Collection & Transport
System was evaluated at room temperature (20–25oC) in real time in support of claims of media
stability prior to sample collection. Shelf-life stability tests included: (a) pH monitoring, (b)
visual estimation of turbidity, and (c) viscosity measurement. Based on available data, the
sponsor’s claim of shelf-life stability of 18 months for the ARX Liquid Amies Collection &
Transport System is acceptable.
The pH of the ARX Liquid Amies Media was measured in real-time at monthly intervals from
the date of manufacture (Table 1). Random tubes from independent lots stored at room
temperature (20–25⁰C) were tested and found to maintain their pH within the specified range
(7.30 ± 0.2).

Bacterial Recovery Studies:
Performance of ARX Liquid Amies Collection & Transport System for bacterial recovery was
determined using roll plate and swab elution methods, following the FDA-recognized sections of
Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M40-A2:2014 Quality Control of
Microbiological Transport Systems; Approved Standard – Second Edition. As shown in Table 3,
a total of three (3) aerobic, six (6) facultative anaerobic (including one (1) fastidious organism),
and eight (8) obligate anaerobic bacteria was included in the bacterial recovery studies.
Additionally, Table 3 also lists the appropriate Negative Clinical Matrix (NCM) that was used in
all these studies. For dilution of the inoculum, a subset of these organisms was tested in the
presence of NCM or sterile saline (in a separate set where negative clinical matrix was omitted),
whereas another subset of the organisms used saline only. The data indicated no impact on
performance for the most challenging organisms when diluted in either matrix or saline.
Additionally, justification was provided to support the claim that the subset of organisms tested
in saline is expected to have equivalent performance in the presence of matrix.
Performance was assessed using the Roll-Plate and Swab Elution methods. Manual colony
counts were conducted for both at all time intervals for each swab-organism combination, and
the mean count was recorded per anatomical site. Three (3) dilutions were analyzed for each test
organism and the dilution yielding colony counts nearest 300 CFU at time zero was reported
and/or used for mean CFU/mL estimations, following the recommendations of CLSI M40-A2
(sections 8.12.1, 8.12.3, and 8.12.4 for Roll-Plate studies; sections 8.11.1, 8.11.2, 8.11.4 for
Swab Elution studies). Acceptance criteria for bacterial recovery (minimum acceptable viability
of at least 2% CFU relative to time 0 for Roll-plate studies; maximum 3 log decline in CFU
10
acceptable relative to time 0 for Swab Elution studies) were followed as recommended in CLSI
M40-A2. As discussed in the respective sections below and shown in Tables 4–11 below, the
performance of all bacterial recovery, when used with or without NCM, was found to be
acceptable.

Roll-Plate Method:
For the roll-plate method, bacterial suspensions were prepared to approximately 0.5 McFarland
standard in NCM (as indicated in Table 3) followed by 10-fold serial dilutions in pooled NCM.
The performance characteristics of ARX Liquid Amies Collection & Transport System were
determined using procedures outlined in CLSI M40-A2 using three sterile flocked swab types
(i.e., NPS, nasopharyngeal swab, with or without tapered tip design; OPS, oropharyngeal swab)
designed for throat, urogenital and nasal specimen collection. This study was conducted at two
different temperatures to reflect refrigerated (2–8°C) and room temperature (25–30°C)
conditions in NCM and used three (3) independent lots of ARX Liquid Amies representing old
(Lot #A030921, post-production age at study: 23–24 months), middle-aged (Lot #AR1002, age:
6–7 months), and newly manufactured (Lot #A1229222, age: 1–2 months) lots. The swabs from
each transport system were inoculated in triplicate with a specified volume of select bacterial
suspensions prepared in NCM and saline or in saline only. These swabs were then placed in their
respective transport vial and held for 0, 24, and 48 hrs. (except Neisseria gonorrhoeae held only
for 24 hrs.); at the designated time intervals the swabs were removed and processed for recovery
of bacterial CFU counts (refer to Table 4 and Table 5).
Additional set of roll-plate testing was performed using 0.5 McFarland suspensions prepared and
serially diluted in sterile saline to the desired concentration. The performance characteristics of
ARX Liquid Amies Collection & Transport System in saline were determined as above using the
two NPS types. This study was conducted at two different temperatures to reflect refrigerated (2–
8°C) and ambient temperature (20–25°C) conditions in saline, along with the addition of
additional bacterial strains (as indicated in Table 3), and used three (3) independent lots of ARX
Liquid Amies representing old (Lot #A030921; post-production age at study: 17 months),
middle-aged (Lot #AR1001/2/3, age:6–7 months), and newly manufactured (Lot #A061422, age:
2 months) lots. The swabs from each transport system were inoculated in triplicate with a
specified volume of select bacterial suspensions prepared in sterile saline, placed in their
respective transport vials, and held for 0, 24, and 48 hrs. (except Neisseria gonorrhoeae held
only for 24 hrs.); at the designated time intervals the swabs were removed and processed for
recovery of bacterial CFU counts (refer to Table 6 and Table 7).

Swab Elution Method:
For the Swab-Elution method, bacterial suspensions were prepared in NCM similar to the roll-
plate method (as indicated in Table 3). The performance characteristics of ARX Liquid Amies
Collection & Transport System were determined using the procedures outlined in CLSI M40-A2
using three sterile flocked swab types (i.e., NPS, nasopharyngeal swab, with or without tapered
tip design; OPS, oropharyngeal swab) designed for throat, urogenital and nasal specimen
collection. This study was conducted at two different temperatures to reflect refrigerated (2–8°C)
and room temperature (25–30°C) conditions in NCM and used three (3) independent lots of
ARX Liquid Amies representing old (Lot #A030921, post-production age at study: 23–24
months), middle-aged (Lot #AR1002, age: 6–7 months), and newly manufactured (Lot
#A1229222, age: 1–2 months) lots. The swabs from each transport system were inoculated in
triplicate with a specified volume of select bacterial suspensions prepared either in NCM or in
saline or in saline only. These swabs were then placed in their respective transport vial and held
for 0, 24, and 48 hrs. (except Neisseria gonorrhoeae held only for 24 hrs.); at the designated time
intervals the swabs were removed and processed for recovery of bacterial CFU/mL counts (refer
to Table 8 and Table 9).
Additional swab elution testing was performed using bacterial suspensions prepared and serially
diluted in sterile saline to the desired concentration. The performance characteristics of ARX
Liquid Amies Collection & Transport System in saline were determined as above using the two
NPS types. This study was conducted at two different temperatures to reflect refrigerated (2–
8°C) and room temperature (20–25°C) conditions in saline, along with the addition of additional
bacterial strains (as indicated in Table 3), and used three (3) independent lots of ARX Liquid
Amies representing old (Lot #A030921; post-production age at study: 17 months), middle-aged
(Lot #AR1001/2/3, age:6–7 months), and newly manufactured (Lot #A061422, age: 2 months)
lots. The swabs from each transport system were inoculated in triplicate with a specified volume
of select bacterial suspensions prepared in sterile saline, placed in their respective transport vials,
and held for 0, 24, and 48 hrs. (except Neisseria gonorrhoeae held only for 24 hrs.); at the
designated time intervals the swabs were removed and processed for recovery of bacterial CFU
counts (refer to Table 10 and Table 11).

Conclusions from Bacterial Recovery Studies:
Using both the Roll-Plate and Swab Elution Methods, the ARX Liquid Amies Collection &
Transport System showed recovery of bacteria within the acceptance criteria comparable to the
predicate device for all holding temperatures tested. This demonstrates the acceptability of a
stability claim of up to 48 hours for all organisms (except 24 hours for Neisseria gonorrhoeae) in
clinical samples during storage and/or transport in this transport system.
B Comparison Studies:
Method Comparison with Predicate Device, Matrix Comparison:
Not Applicable
C Clinical Studies:
Clinical Sensitivity, Clinical Specificity, Other Clinical Supportive Data, Clinical Cut-Off,
Expected Values/Reference Ranges:
Not Applicable
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
