IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Premier Resolution System consists of a high-performance liquid chromatographic analyzer
(Premier Resolution Analyzer), reagents, analytical column, and software. The system allows for
the fractionation and quantitation of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), hemoglobin A (HbA), and
hemoglobin A2 (Hb A2), and the qualitative detection of major variant hemoglobin S, C, D-Los
Angeles and E in adult, adolescent, children, and infant populations. This is accomplished using
the principles of ion-exchange (IEX) high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The
Analyzer consists of an integrated HPLC (Pumps, Injection, Valve and Detector), compact
sample preparation system (Probe/Injection Port, Syringe Module and Sample Transport) and the
workstation (CPU, Printer and Touch Screen Interface) with the Resolution Application
Software.
The Premier Resolution Analyzer consists of four main components:
1. The HPLC system is comprised of a dual high pressure pump system, column, sample loop
and fixed wavelength detector.
2. The autosampler, comprising of the Sample Probe, Syringe Module, and Injection Port, is
paired with the Sample Transport system. Together these provide automated analysis for

B Principle of Operation:
The Premier Resolution System employs the principles of ion exchange and high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). The instrument’s pumps transfer reagents through the analytical
column. The analytical column contains an ion-exchange resin bound to a silica gel support.
Hemolyzed samples are automatically injected onto the column during the flow of a mix of
Premier Mobile Phase 1 and Mobile Phase 2. Hemoglobin species migrate through the column at
rates determined by their individual physical properties. The charged proteins in the hemoglobin
chains bind to the polyaspartic acid coating on the silica gel. As the assay continues, the gradient
is increased to a higher percentage of Mobile Phase 2 to increase the ionic strength. The stronger
ionic strength displaces the stronger bonded proteins from the polyaspartic acid coating. The
weakest to strongest bonded hemoglobin fractions elute in the following sequence as the ionic
strength of the mobile phase increases: HbF, HbA, HbE, HbA2, HbD, HbS and finally HbC.
Once the hemoglobin has been displaced, it passes through the spectrophotometric detector,
where it is detected at 413±2nm.
The compositions of Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 1 & 2 Reagents are designed to exhibit
virtually identical absorption in the 413±2nm range to ensure a stable baseline. The detector
signal is also referenced by the split-beam technique.
In the final stage of the assay, the column is re-equilibrated with Premier Resolution Mobile
Phase 1 as the primary reagent. All reagent selection occurs in a timed sequence designed to
allow complete elution of hemoglobin fractions.
All functions are controlled by the computer. The computer processes the signal from the
spectrophotometric detector and calculates the concentration of hemoglobin fractions as a
percentage of the total detected. Integration is by peak area in Absorbance Units (AU)-seconds.
The computer software also calculates the retention time.
As the sample is processed, the chromatogram is displayed at the top right of the main assay
screen in real time. The computer produces printed reports with the sample identification
information, date, and time, followed by the chromatogram with peaks either numbered or with
retention times indicated at the apex of each peak. A peak summary report is printed after the
chromatogram with the retention time, relative retention time, % area and comments for each
peak in the chromatogram.
The software, specially designed for Variant analysis, controls the four basic analyzer operation
functions of sample identification, analyzer operation, calculation of results, as well as printing
and storing complete reports. Based on computer hard disc capacity, chromatograms and batch
summary reports can be automatically archived.

with five (5) replicates per run. Five (5) whole blood samples with varying levels of
hemoglobin A, A2, F, S, C, D-Los Angeles, and E were tested on the Premier Resolution
using the Quick Scan and High-Resolution assay modes.
The following testing were performed each day over the course of five (5) days (not
necessarily consecutive days):
• Three (3) different lots of Premier Resolution analytical columns were tested using
only one (1) dedicated instrument, one (1) lot of Mobile Phase 1 and 2, and one (1) lot
of Diluent to generate the column-to-column precision data.
• Three (3) different lots of Mobile Phase 1 were tested using only one (1) dedicated
instrument, one (1) lot of analytical column, one (1) lot of Mobile Phase 2 and one (1)
lot of Diluent to generate the Mobile Phase-to-Mobile Phase precision data.
• Three (3) different lots of Mobile Phase 2 were tested using only one (1) dedicated
instrument, one (1) lot of analytical column, one (1) lot of Mobile Phase 1 and one (1)
lot of Diluent to generate the Mobile Phase-to-Mobile Phase precision data.
• Three (3) different lots of Diluent were tested using only one (1) dedicated instrument,
one (1) lot of analytical column, and one (1) lot of Mobile Phase 1 and 2 to generate
the Diluent-to-Diluent precision data.
• Three (3) Premier Resolution systems were tested using only one (1) lot of analytical
columns, one (1) lot of Mobile Phase 1 and 2, and one (1) lot of Diluent. The
instrument-to-instrument data were collected from the first run of each day
consumable lot studies.
Overall, the performance of the Premier Resolution System met the predetermined
specifications. The results are summarized below.

Multisite Precision (Reproducibility)
A multisite precision study was conducted using a 3x5x5 study design across three (3) sites
over five (5) days with five (5) replicates per day. Three (3) Premier Resolution Systems (one
per site) and Mobile Phase 1, 2, and Diluent Reagents (one lot of each), analytical column,
and precision samples for the study were provided to the sites. The study assessed
instrument-to-instrument, operator-to-operator, and site-to-site precision. Seven (7) whole
blood samples with varying levels of hemoglobin A, A2, F, S, C, D-Los Angeles, and E were
tested on the Premier Resolution using the Quick Scan and High-Resolution assay modes.
The performance of the Premier Resolution System in the Multisite Precision Study of the
Quick Scan and High Resolution Assay Repeatability and Reproducibility Precision study
performed met the predetermined acceptance criteria.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted to establish the linear range of quantitative measurements of
normal hemoglobin A, A2 and F and major variants S, C, D-Los Angeles, and E on the
Premier Resolution. The study was performed at a single site. Linearity was determined for
HbF, HbA, HbA2, HbS, HbC, HbD-LA, and HbE for both Quick Scan and High Resolution
modes. Hemoglobin species of HbF, HbA, HbA2, HbS, HbC, HbD-LA, and HbE were each
prepared with 13 equally spaced concentration levels with 4 replicates per level. Quick Scan
and High Resolution data were evaluated separately for each hemoglobin A, A2, F, S, C, D-
Los Angeles, and E.
The linearity ranges for individual hemoglobin fractions are summarized below.
Hemoglobin Quick Scan Range High Resolution Range
HbF 0.4 – 71.6% 0.4 – 72.3%
HbA 0.0 – 89.7% 0.0 – 90.5%
HbA2 1.5 – 6.1% 1.6 – 6.1%

HbE 0.0 – 81.3% 0.0 – 77.1%
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
An interference study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of the Premier Resolution
system to the following interfering substances: D-Glucose, acetaldehyde, lipemia
(triglycerides), icterus (bilirubin), acetylsalicylic acid, sodium heparin, lithium heparin,
K2EDTA, and K3EDTA. Human blood samples containing HbA, HbA2, HbF, HbS, HbC,
HbD-LA and HbE were tested with interfering substances. Each hemoglobin species was
evaluated at two different levels. Spiked experimental samples and a control sample were

prepared from the same source of blood for each interferent. From this testing, the maximum
amount of the interferent that does not cause analytical interference was determined.
Each substance with the potential to cause interference was tested at a concentration level
that is at least three times the highest expected concentration or at least five times the
recommended additive concentration for anticoagulants and preservatives.
Overall, it was established that there is no interference with the quantitation of hemoglobin
fractions HbF, HbA, HbA2, HbS, HbC, HbD-LA, and HbE from the following interferents up
to the concentrations stated in the table below:

temperature (20–25°C), refrigerated (2–8°C), frozen (-18 to -22°C) and frozen (-70°C) was
evaluated. Also, after each time point of the study, the hemolysate samples were kept on
board and evaluated 24 hours later for on-board stability.
The freeze-thaw effects on patient samples were also evaluated. The freeze-thaw stability
testing requires fresh, never frozen samples to be tested initially. The sample then underwent
24 hours of storage in a -65 to -75°C environment. The sample was taken out, thawed, and
retested on the same instrument and consumables. This process was repeated for a total of 10
freeze-thaw data points. Each freezing event was required to be stored at -65 to -75°C for at
least 24 hours before thawing. This study determined the number of freeze-thaw cycles a
sample can go through before degrading.
Whole blood samples of normal, HbF, HbS, HbC, HbD-Los Angeles and HbE were used.
Human whole blood samples, free of known interferences, were used for this study. The
samples were tested on the Premier Resolution using the Quick Scan and High-Resolution
assay modes. Sample stability was assessed in terms of measurand drift for each test sample.
Overall, the sample stability study data support the following claims:
• The recommended storage stability for blood collected as samples in K2EDTA
anticoagulant tubes is:
48 hours at 20 to 25oC (RT)
o
7 days at 2 to 8oC (Refrigerated)
o
168 days at -75 to -65°C (Frozen)
o
• The on-board stability is 24 hours.
• The recommended number of allowable freeze-thaw cycles is one (1).
Reagent Stability
The stability of the Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 1 (940mL), Premier Resolution Mobile
Phase 1 (3.8L), Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 2 (940mL), Premier Resolution Mobile
Phase 2 (3.8L), Premier Resolution Diluent (3.8L), Premier Resolution Wash, (940mL), and
Premier Resolution Piston Wash (940mL), which are reagents used with the Premier
Resolution System, was evaluated. Three lots of these reagents were aged in standard
packaging for performance testing at the following timepoints:
• Initial
• 12 Month
• 24 Month
• 26 Month.
At each interval, the in-use (open container) stability claim of 60 day was performance
validated as well, including at 30, 60, and 66 days to provide an additional safety margin.
Overall, the Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 1 (940mL), Premier Resolution Mobile Phase
1 (3.8L), Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 2 (940mL), Premier Resolution Mobile Phase 2
(3.8L), Premier Resolution Diluent (3.8L), Premier Resolution Wash (940mL), and Premier

Resolution Piston Wash (940mL) are stable when stored at the specified temperature ranges
of 2–28°C/36–82°F for up to two years from the date of production based on successfully
completed stability studies.
6. Detection Limit:
A study was conducted to determine the limit of quantitation (LoQ), limit of blank (LoB),
and limits of detection (LoD), for hemoglobin A, A2, F, S, C, D-Los Angeles, and E on the
Premier Resolution System. The LoB/LoD/LoQ study was performed using one (1)
instrument, two (2) different reagent lots over the course of five (5) days with four (4) levels
for each phenotype, three (3) replicates per day. Two instruments were allocated to the study
to perform the Quick Scan and High-Resolution runs simultaneously. The Quick Scan and
High-Resolution data statistics were calculated independent of one another.
For the LoB evaluation, Diluent Reagent, as used for onboard sample dilutions, was utilized
as the blank sample determinations. Each run was QC verified with FASC and A2+F controls
bracketing for the 60 Limit of Blank data points generated over two days.
For the LoD and LoQ evaluation, human whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA tubes
containing 4 different levels of HbA, HbA2, HbF, HbS, HbC, HbD-Los Angeles and HbE
were tested in the Quick Scan and High Resolution modes. One Premier Resolution
instrument was used for Quick Scan, the second Premier Resolution instrument was used for
High-Resolution. Four (4) samples with concentrations between 0.1–5.0% of the analytes,
HbF, HbA2, HbS, HbC, HbD-Los Angeles, and HbE, were analyzed daily on each
instrument in replicates of three (3) for five (5) days, providing 60 data points per reagent lot
of each phenotype in the Quick Scan and High Resolution mode.
The derived LoB, LoD, and LoQ are summarized below.

9. Carry-Over:
A study was conducted to evaluate the carryover effects for hemoglobins A, A2, and F on the
Premier Resolution Quick Scan (QS) and High Resolution (HR) assay modes.
In the evaluation of HbA carryover, a variant trait sample (HbS) was used as the low-level
concentration sample and normal patient blood was used as the high-level concentration
sample. In the evaluation of HbA2 carryover, A2+F Control level I were used as the low-
level concentration sample and A2+F Control Level II were used as the high-level
concentration sample. In the evaluation of HbF carryover, a high HbF(>14%) patient sample
was used as the high-level concentration sample and a normal patient sample was used as the
low-level concentration sample.
Overall, the Premier Resolution Quick Scan and High Resolution assays for HbA, HbA2, and
HbF passed the pre-defined acceptance criteria and therefore demonstrated no significant
carryover in using the Quick Scan or the High Resolution assay mode for the quantitation of
HbA, HbA2, and HbF.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted to compare the performance of the Premier
Resolution system to that of the predicate, Bio-Rad Variant II system, to demonstrate
substantial equivalence between the test method and the comparator method with respect to
quantitation of Hb A, A2 and F, and detection of hemoglobins S, C, D and E in patient whole
blood samples. The study was performed at three external sites. The test samples at each
testing site included normal and abnormal samples.
Each site tested patient samples on the Premier Resolution using both the Quick Scan assay
and the High Resolution Assay and on the Variant II instrument. All patient samples were
tested on the Premier Resolution within two days of the comparative method or within
sample storage stability, whichever was shorter.
Data was analyzed per site and was combined from all sites for analysis. Data analysis
consisted of a linear comparison by Passing-Bablok method of Hb A, A2, F, S, C, D and E
concentrations between the Premier Resolution and the Bio-Rad Variant II. The standard
error of the regression slope and intercept was computed.

2. Matrix Comparison:
Whole Blood vs. Hemolysate
An evaluation of matrix effects was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP14-A2: Evaluation
of Matrix Effects; Approved Guideline – Second Edition. Whole blood collected was used as
the reference comparative method against prepared hemolysates. The instrument performed
an automated dilution on whole blood samples, prepared hemolysate samples were used to
test if there were matrix effects on manual preparation of the hemolysate against the
reference, whole blood. Test venous whole blood samples consisted of each hemoglobin,
HbA, HbA2, HbF, HbS, HbC, HbD-Los Angeles, and HbE.
Bland-Altman analysis and Passing-Bablok regression analysis were performed on samples
of each phenotype. All phenotypes were found to fall within the acceptable criteria.
