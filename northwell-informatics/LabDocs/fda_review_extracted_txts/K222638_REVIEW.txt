III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Xpert Xpress GBS test, performed on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems, is an automated,
real-time PCR test for the qualitative detection of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA from
vaginal/rectal swab specimens collected from pregnant patients for intrapartum testing at term
(e.g., >37 weeks) who have unknown or unavailable antepartum GBS screening test results and
no additional risk factors that would warrant empiric antibiotic prophylaxis. The Xpert Xpress
GBS test performed during intrapartum is intended to aid in the detection of GBS colonization in
patients presenting in labor who may be candidates for antibiotic prophylaxis.
The Xpert Xpress GBS test does not provide antimicrobial susceptibility test results. Culture is
necessary to obtain isolates to perform susceptibility testing as recommended for penicillin-
allergic patients.
This test is conducted using direct specimen without enrichment (enrichment is recommended to
enhance detection of GBS colonization). In contrast to a positive test result, which can indicate
colonization, a presumptive negative result cannot exclude the possibility of GBS colonization.
A false negative test result at intrapartum carries a potential harm to the infant if it is used in
making decisions regarding empiric antibiotic prophylaxis. Providers must use caution and
default to known patient risk factors and clinical guidance regarding a role for intrapartum
prophylaxis.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Xpert Xpress GBS test is an automated in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA from vaginal/rectal swab specimens collected from
pregnant patients at intrapartum. The test is performed on the GeneXpert Instrument System
K222638 - Page 2 of 20

--- Page 3 ---
which automates and integrates sample preparation, nucleic acid amplification, and real-time
detection of target sequences. The system consists of an instrument, computer, and preloaded
software for running tests and viewing the results.
The sample collection device allows dual vaginal/rectal swab specimens from patients to be
collected and transported to laboratory prior to analysis with the Xpert Xpress GBS test. The
Xpert Xpress GBS has an Early Assay Termination (EAT) feature that enables early result
reporting. EAT is activated when the pre-determined threshold for a positive test result is
reached before the full number of PCR cycles have been completed.
B Principle of Operation:
Depending on the instrument, the GeneXpert Instrument Systems can have from 1-80 randomly
accessible modules, each capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR
tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates
the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between
chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE thermocycler
for performing real-time PCR as well as detection. The systems require the use of single-use
disposable cartridges that hold the PCR reagents and host sample purification, nucleic acid
amplification, and detection of the target sequences. Because the cartridges are self- contained,
cross-contamination between cartridges during the testing process is minimized.
The Xpert Xpress GBS test includes reagents for the simultaneous detection of target GBS DNA
from vaginal/rectal swab specimens, where primers and probes in the Xpert test are designed to
amplify and detect unique sequence in two conserved chromosomal targets in S. agalactiae: 1) a
member of the glycosyl transferase gene family, and 2) a LysR transcriptional regulator. A
Sample Adequacy Control (SAC), Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control
(PCC) are also included in the cartridge utilized by the GeneXpert instrument. The SAC is a non-
target sequence naturally present in the specimen, which is amplified along with the assay target
to ensure that the sample is properly collected and contains adequate human cells from the
vaginal/rectal flora. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the sample and to
monitor for the presence of potential inhibitor(s) in the PCR reaction. The SPC also ensures that
the PCR reaction conditions (temperature and time) are appropriate for the amplification reaction
and that the PCR reagents are functional. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling,
and confirms that all reaction components are present in the cartridge including monitoring for
probe integrity and dye stability.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
The Xpert Xpress GBS test can be run on the following GeneXpert Instruments:
• GeneXpert Dx (software version 5.3 or higher)
• GeneXpert Infinity-48s (software version Xpertise 6.8 or higher)
• GeneXpert Infinity-80 (software version Xpertise 6.8 or higher)
2. Specimen Identification:
To perform a test, the user selects the ‘Create Test’ icon, enters or scans the sample ID
barcode, scans the cartridge barcode, selects the assay that has been ordered, and loads the
K222638 - Page 3 of 20

--- Page 4 ---
cartridge in into the module to start the test. The GeneXpert System software controls the
operation of the sample processing and the I-CORE module that collect, analyze and interpret
the acquired optical data.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Vaginal/rectal swabs are collected using the Cepheid Collection Device with Liquid Stuart
Medium. The two swabs should be brushed together using a twirling motion for five seconds.
The second swab is then returned to the transport tube. The swab for testing is held above the
score mark using gauze or equivalent and inserted into the Xpert Xpress GBS cartridge
sample chamber. The swab is broken by snapping the shaft to the right. After lid closure, the
cartridge is loaded on the GeneXpert Instrument System platform for automated sample
processing and real-time PCR for detection of targets.
4. Calibration:
Routine calibration of the GeneXpert instrument systems is performed periodically by
Cepheid Field Service Engineers.
5. Quality Control:
Each test includes a SPC, SAC, and PPC. External controls should be used in accordance
with local, state, and federal accrediting organizations as applicable.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Xpert Xpress GBS test was evaluated in a multi-center, blinded
study using two panels totaling ten members that consisted of simulated vaginal/rectal matrix
as negative sample (see matrix equivalency section), as well as low positive (~1-1.5x LoD)
and moderate positive (~3x LoD) samples prepared by spiking GBS strains into simulated
vaginal/rectal matrix at the respective target levels. Three strains of GBS representing
hemolytic phenotypes (serotypes Ia, III, IV) and one strain (Serotype Ic) representing a non-
hemolytic phenotype were used in the study. Testing was performed at three sites (one
internal, two external) using the GeneXpert Instrument Systems. Each panel member was

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical Specificity
The analytical specificity and microbial interference of the Xpert Xpress GBS test were
evaluated by testing a panel of 129 non-GBS organisms that can potentially cross-react and
interfere with the detection of GBS both in the presence (microbial interference) and absence
(cross-reactivity/exclusivity) of GBS. Challenge organisms tested included bacterial, viral,
parasite, and yeast strains commonly found in vaginal/rectal flora or were considered
phylogenetically related to GBS. On each day of testing, one positive and one negative
control were also tested in parallel. Panel members are shown in Table 3 below.
Pools were prepared by diluting each organism into GBS negative simulated sample matrix
to produce final concentrations in replicates of 6. Bacteria and yeast were tested at
concentrations of ≥ 1x106 CFU/mL, except for Staphylococcus aureus, which was tested at
2x105 CFU/mL. Viruses and parasites were tested at concentrations of > 1x105 units/mL
(tachyzoites, IU or copies/mL). Genomic DNA was tested at > 1x106 copies/mL. The panel
of 129 organisms was tested either individually or in pools of 2 - 6 microorganisms in
simulated sample matrix in presence of GBS (at 3x LoD) or absence of GBS. No cross-
reactivity or microbial interference of GBS detection was observed with any of the clinically
relevant pathogens tested in the study.

Collectively, the results for the GBS positive samples demonstrated that none of the 129
microbial organisms included in this study interfered with the Xpert Xpress GBS test’s
ability to detect GBS and are not cross-reactants under these conditions.
Interference Study
Substances that may be present in vaginal/rectal specimens with the potential to interfere
with the Xpert Xpress GBS test were evaluated. The inhibitory effects were assessed with 8
endogenous and 25 exogenous substances both in the presence and absence of GBS.
Potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances included human amniotic fluid,
meconium, urine, fecal material, human blood, lubricating gel, vaginal anti-itch medications,
vaginal antifungal medications, anti-diarrheal medications, laxatives, stool softeners, topical
hemorrhoid ointments, body oil, body powder, deodorant sprays, enema solutions, and
spermicidal foam. Potentially interfering substances were tested according to a liquid, solid,
or tablet workflow. Liquid substances were added directly to the swab. Solid substances were
added to the swab by dipping three fourths (3/4) of the swab head into the substance. Tablets
were first dissolved in simulated sample matrix and then liquid added directly to the swab.
These substances are listed in Table 4 below.
Negative samples consisting only of simulated matrix were tested in replicates of 6 in the
presence of each substance to determine the effect on the performance of the SPC and SAC.
Positive samples were prepared by spiking GBS serotype Ia into simulated matrix at 3x LoD
then tested in replicates of 6 per substance. The negative and positive controls were prepared
in the absence of potentially interfering substances and consisted of simulated sample matrix
only and GBS spiked at 3x LoD into simulated sample matrix, respectively.
Among the 25 exogenous substances tested in this study, 5 exogenous substances (Aquasonic
gel, Floraplus, Pepto Bismol, Body oil, and Xyloproct) showed interference at the
concentration initially tested and were subsequently tested at a lower concentration to
determine the highest concentration at which no interference was observed. A list of the
endogenous and exogenous substances along with their forms and the highest concentrations
at which all GBS positive and negative samples were correctly identified by the Xpert Xpress
GBS test (i.e., no observed interference) are shown in Table 4 below. Cord serum stock was
contaminated with GBS and, therefore, the results were not valid for analysis of interference.
These data were excluded from further evaluation. No interference was observed with any of
the other endogenous substances tested in the study. The inhibitory effects of Aquasonic gel,
Xyloproct, Multi-Gyn Floraplus, Pepto Bismol, and skin oil were included in the product
labeling.
Of 879 tests (including external controls), 10 tests (1.1%) provided non-substance-related
non-determinate test results—4 INVALID, 5 NO RESULT and 1 ERROR. In addition, 65
tests provided substance-related non-determinate GeneXpert results (63 INVALID, 1 NO
RESULT and 1 ERROR). The samples were re-tested as allowed by the protocol and valid or
non-determinate results were obtained for the re-test. Non-determinate results from re-tests
were reported as such. Each of the positive and negative external controls run daily during
the study produced the expected GeneXpert test results.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
N/A
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Each test includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC), Sample Adequacy Control (SAC) and
a Probe check control (PCC).
Internal Controls
• Sample Adequacy Control (SAC): Detects the presence of a single copy human gene
present in one copy per cell and monitors whether the sample contains human DNA.
The SAC controls for adequate sample collection and sample stability to minimize
risk of false negative. The SAC should PASS (i.e., generate a valid cycle threshold
(Ct) in a negative sample) and may not amplify in a high positive sample. The SAC
passes if it meets the assigned acceptance criteria and is required for a GBS
PRESUMPTIVE NEGATIVE result.
• Sample Processing Control (SPC): Ensures the sample was processed correctly. The
SPC verifies that sample processing is adequate. Additionally, this control detects
sample-associated inhibition of the real-time PCR assay, ensures the PCR reaction
conditions (temperature and time) are appropriate for the amplification reaction, and
that the PCR reagents are functional. The SPC should PASS (i.e., generate a valid
cycle threshold (Ct) in a negative sample) and may not amplify in a high positive
sample. The SPC passes if it meets the assigned acceptance criteria.
• Probe Check Control (PCC): Before the start of the PCR reaction, the GeneXpert
Instrument System measures the fluorescence signal from the probes to monitor bead
rehydration, reaction-tube filling, probe integrity and dye stability. Probe Check
passes if it meets the assigned acceptance criteria.
External Controls
External controls were evaluated in a study with three lots of commercially available, single,
ready-to-use, external controls (positive and negative) manufactured by Microbiologics (St.
Cloud, MN, USA) for use with Xpert Xpress GBS test. These external controls were used as
daily controls during design verification studies and clinical studies. The external positive
control swab was comprised of a lyophilized isolate of Streptococcus agalactiae, whereas the
negative external control swab included of a lyophilized mixture of Lactobacillus
acidophilus and a recombinant E. coli strain carrying the SAC target. The test results for the
positive control were considered valid if a “GBS POSITIVE” result was generated. The valid
test result for the negative control was “GBS PRESUMPTIVE NEGATIVE.” Twenty
replicates for each of the 3 positive external control lots and 20 replicates for each of the 3
negative external control lots were evaluated using one lot of the Xpert Xpress GBS test (lot
10751) for a total of 120 replicates. All negative external control replicates (60/60) and
positive external control replicates (60/60) were correctly reported. Of the 120 tests
performed between negative and positive external controls, none (0%) provided non-
determinate GeneXpert results.
Sample Stability
The objective of this study was to determine the specimen stability to support the transport
and storage claims for the following specimen types and transport media to be used with the
Xpert Xpress GBS test:
K222638 - Page 12 of 20

--- Page 13 ---
• Dual rayon swab for vaginal/rectal specimen
• Copan, Liquid Stuart Medium (polyurethane sponge)
Specimen stability studies were conducted in simulated and clinical sample matrices to
establish specimen transport and storage claims in the Cepheid collection device. For the
specimen stability study with simulated matrix, samples were evaluated with negative and
positive samples spiked onto swabs. The positive sample was one strain of GBS serotype Ia
(ATCC 12386) spiked at 1989 CFU/ml (3xLoD) into simulated sample matrix. The assay
performance using each specimen type was established by storing each sample under room
temperature (25 ± 3°C) for up to 30 hours and at refrigerated (2-8°C) temperatures for up to
seven days. The data support a specimen stability claim for dual vaginal/rectal swabs using
the Cepheid collection device at room temperature (25±3 °C) up to 24 hours and at
refrigerated temperatures (2-8 °C) for up to six days. For the clinical sample evaluation, 26
GBS positive specimens were available for analysis. All 26 specimens were stored at 2-8℃
from the time of swab collection until time of Xpert Xpress GBS testing (3.3 days to 16.2
days). Even though the assay is qualitative, the mean GBS Ct values observed for samples
stored at various times were used to assess specimen stability. It was observed that the mean
GBS Ct values of specimens collected at intrapartum that were stored at 2-8°C for ≤7 days
(N=8; mean 31.8; SD 5.9) had similar ranges to the GBS Ct values of specimens that were
stored for >7 Days (N=18; mean 30.8; SD 4.4). All samples remained positive.
Labeling will state that specimens can be stored up to 24 hours at 2-25°C (if repeat testing is
needed). Cepheid indicated that additional stability information will be made available upon
request.
Reagent Stability
The shelf-life of the Xpert Xpress GBS test was determined in stability studies using real-
time stability data from three lots of the final product configuration. Each kit lot used in the
stability study was functionally tested with five samples—four of which were positive for
GBS, and one which was negative for GBS. For all 3 lots used in the real-time and shipping
stability study, functional testing is ongoing for up to 37 months. Currently, the stability
testing data on three lots (10451, 10651 and 10751) support a shelf-life claim of 24 months at
the temperature range of 2°-28°C.
6. Detection Limit:
The objective of this study was to determine the analytical sensitivity or Limit of Detection
(LoD) of Xpert Xpress GBS with known GBS serotypes (serotype Ia, Ib, Ic, II-X). The
analytical reactivity (inclusivity) of the Xpert Xpress GBS test was determined for 12
different strains representing 12 known serotypes of GBS, including both hemolytic and non-
hemolytic GBS strains. This study was conducted in 2 parts: (1) LoD estimation and (2) LoD
verification. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration of GBS (reported as CFU/mL
or CFU/swab) that could be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with 95%
confidence using Probit analysis (Table 5). Serial dilutions of each serotype were prepared in
a simulated sample matrix. Serotypes Ia, III and V were tested with 24 replicates per dilution
level for each of two reagent lots across three days. Serotypes Ib, Ic, II, IV and VI-X were
tested in replicates of 24 for each dilution level using one reagent lot across three days. The
K222638 - Page 13 of 20

--- Page 14 ---
estimated LoD values were verified by testing 20 replicates of each serotype diluted in
simulated sample matrix with one reagent lot across three days. Serotype Ia, III and V were
also verified in clinical matrix. The result for serotypes V and VI was 85% (17/20) detected
and the claimed LoD was based on the upper limit of 95% confidence interval. The verified
LoD values for the GBS serotypes tested are provided in Table 5. All serotypes (Ia, Ib, Ic, II,
III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X) were detected by the Xpert Xpress GBS test.

Analytical Inclusivity of Cfb Mutants
An additional study was performed to evaluate the analytical reactivity (inclusivity) of Xpert
Xpress GBS for strains containing different deletions ranging from 181 bp to 49 kb in or
adjacent to the region of the chromosome that encodes the CAMP factor hemolysis gene cfb.
Ten (10) unique, well characterized GBS clinical specimens representing different cfb
mutations were diluted in simulated sample matrix to a concentration of 855 CFU/mL (~ 1x
the highest observed LoD) and tested in the Xpert Xpress GBS test. The study was conducted
over 3 days testing either 6 or 7 replicates on each day for a total of 20 replicates. All strains
with cfb mutations were detected with a positivity rate of 100%. Of the 208 tests (including
external controls), 2 tests (1.0%) provided non-determinate GeneXpert results (2 NO
RESULT). All non-determinate runs were successfully repeated. Each of the positive and
negative external controls run daily during the study produced the expected GeneXpert test
results. Therefore, the Xpert Xpress GBS test detected GBS strains with mutations in the cfb
gene.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The Xpert Xpress GBS test uses channels to detect the GBS target, SPC, and SAC. The Ct
cut-offs are included as automatic calculations in the assay definition file (ADF) of the Xpert
Xpress GBS test.
The Xpert Xpress GBS has an EAT feature that enables early result reporting. EAT is
activated when the pre-determined threshold for a positive test result is reached before the
full number of PCR cycles have been completed.

9. Carry-Over:
A study was conducted to demonstrate that Xpert Xpress GBS single-use, self-contained
cartridges prevent specimen and amplicon carry-over contamination into negative samples
when following the testing of high positive samples in the same GeneXpert module. The
negative sample used in this study consisted of simulated vaginal/rectal matrix and the
positive sample consisted of high GBS serotype Ia positive sample spiked at 1.00E+07
CFU/mL (7.50E+05 CFU/swab) into simulated vaginal/rectal matrix. The negative sample
was tested in a GeneXpert module at the start of the study. Following the initial testing of the
negative sample, a high GBS positive sample was processed in the same GeneXpert module.
This process was repeated 10 times in the same modules, resulting in 10 positives and 11
negatives for the module. The study was repeated using a second GeneXpert module for a
total of 20 positive and 22 negative samples. All results yielded expected results based on
sample type.

2. Matrix Comparison:
Two separate studies were conducted to support the use of simulated sample matrix.
Study #1
The objective of this study was to demonstrate equivalent performance of a simulated sample
matrix and clinical matrix when used for sample preparation in the Xpert Xpress GBS test.
The simulated sample matrix was qualified by comparing analytical performance of the
Xpert Xpress GBS when using the simulated sample matrix and a clinical sample matrix for
the dilution of samples. Both clinical sample matrices from antepartum and intrapartum
collection were included in the comparison. Matrices were spiked with GBS at three different
levels: 5x LoD, 2x LoD, 0.5x LoD. Matrices without GBS were used as negatives. The
simulated sample matrix composition is provided in Table 6 below.

GBS negative clinical matrices (by Xpert Xpress testing) were acquired by first testing swabs
obtained from GBS negative subjects in the Xpert Xpress GBS test (29 antepartum and 35
intrapartum clinical swabs). After testing, the left-over eluted sample in cartridge chamber 3
(approximately 1 mL) was collected and pooled into one antepartum and one intrapartum
pool (clinical sample matrices). Both clinical matrix and the simulated matrix were then
spiked with GBS strain ATCC 12973 (serotype II) at concentrations representing 5x LoD, 2x
LoD and 0.5x LoD. Since this study was performed prior to establishing the final LoD, a
preliminary LoD of 103 CFU/mL (7.7 CFU/swab) estimated by Probit analysis was used
instead of the final LoD (173 CFU/mL or 13 CFU/swab). A negative control consisting of the
respective matrix without GBS was also included. Table 7 shows the results of testing for
Study #1.

successfully repeated. One of negative external control initially yielded an ERROR result and
was successfully repeated. Positive and negative external controls generated expected results
on each of the testing day. The acceptance criteria were met for all three matrices (clinical

sample matrix was qualified to be used in analytical performance studies and the preparation
of reproducibility/precision panels.
Study #2
The objective of this study was to demonstrate comparable performance among antepartum
clinical matrix, intrapartum clinical matrix, and simulated matrix by testing two additional
GBS serotypes. The simulated sample matrix composition was identical to that shown in
Table 6 of Study #1 above. All matrices were spiked with GBS to three concentrations
relative to the LOD (5x LoD, 1-2x LoD and <1x LoD). Matrices without GBS were used as
negative samples.
GBS negative clinical matrix was acquired by pooling leftover sample from 56 clinical GBS
negative antepartum or 132 clinical GBS negative intrapartum samples. Prior to use, both
clinical sample pools were tested and confirmed as GBS negative. Each matrix was spiked
with GBS strain ATCC 12386 (serotype Ia) or GBS strain 12403 (serotype III). Table 8 and
Table 9 show results of testing with GBS Serotype Ia and GBS Serotype III, respectively.

aOne of 10 replicates reported ERROR. The run was successfully repeated to yield 10 valid GeneXpert results.
The overall positivity rates for GBS Serotype Ia and Serotype III were considered acceptable
for each GBS level in each matrix. All replicates of the negative sample yielded the expected
result. Of the 429 tests (including external controls), 5 tests (1.2%) provided non-determinate
GeneXpert results (3 NO RESULT and 2 ERROR). All non-determinate runs were
successfully repeated. Each of the positive and negative external controls run daily during the
study reported the expected GeneXpert test results.
As in Study #1, the simulated sample matrix was shown to have comparable performance
with clinical antepartum and clinical intrapartum matrix with the Xpert Xpress GBS.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical performance characteristics of the Xpert Xpress GBS test were evaluated in a multi-
site, method comparison study using vaginal/rectal swab specimens collected from pregnant
females at intrapartum. The study was conducted at twelve (12) clinical sites from
geographically diverse regions within the United States between July 2020 and November
2021. The clinical performance of the Xpert Xpress GBS test was compared to enriched
bacterial culture with species identification via MALDI-TOF MS. Eligible participants
provided two sets of dual vaginal/rectal swabs. The first set of swabs was divided, where one
swab was used for Xpert Xpress GBS testing and the other was used for culture. If the Xpert
Xpress GBS test resulted in a non-determinate result, the second set of marked swabs was
divided – one swab was used for repeat Xpert Xpress GBS testing; the other was used for
culture testing. Discordant results between the Xpert Xpress GBS test and the comparator
method were investigated using an FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification test, which are
footnoted in Table 10.
Of the 912 vaginal/rectal samples enrolled, 13 were excluded from the analysis of
performance due to non-determinate Xpert Xpress results upon retest or no culture results. A
total of 899 intrapartum vaginal/ rectal specimens were included in the performance analyses.
The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value
(NPV) of the Xpert Xpress GBS test as compared to enriched culture with species
identification via MALDI-TOF MS are presented in Table 10. The Xpert Xpress GBS
demonstrated a sensitivity of 93.5% and specificity of 95.5% for vaginal/rectal swab
specimens collected at intrapartum. A PPV of 66.1% and NPV of 99.4% were observed with
these specimens.

12 specimens remained non-determinate. The initial non-determinate rate was 6.0% (55/912).
Upon retest, the final non-determinate rate was 1.3% (12/912).
Of the 734 external control samples tested, 88.6% (650/734) gave a valid result on the first
test and 11.4% (84/734) were non-determinate. After re-testing 69, the final valid rate for the
external control samples was 97.4% (715/734). Specimen testing did not proceed without
valid external control results per protocol. Of the 715 samples that were valid in final testing,
99.9% (714/715) were in agreement with the expected results.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Prepared Cartridge Hold Time
A study was conducted to determine, under different conditions, the maximum elapsed time
between sample addition and cartridge processing that will not alter the Xpert Xpress GBS
performance. The positive sample consisted of GBS serotype Ia (ATCC 12386) seeded at
1989 CFU/ml (3x LoD) into simulated sample matrix The negative sample consisted of
simulated sample matrix only. Swabs were spiked with 75μl of either the positive or negative
sample, placed into the sample chamber of the cartridges, and held at four storage conditions:
• 25°C/35% relative humidity (RH)
• 15°C/35% RH
• 30°C/35% RH
• 30°C/95% RH
These storage conditions were monitored continuously. Subsequently, the prepared cartridges
containing the positive and negative samples were processed at scheduled time intervals of
T=0, 1, 3, 4.5 and 5 hours. Samples were tested in replicates of 8 for each storage condition
using one lot of Xpert Xpress GBS test. One time point (at 15°C/35% RH) was not included
due to a protocol deviation. All replicates of the negative sample that were tested at each
storage condition and time point correctly reported the expected test results. All replicates of
the positive sample that were tested at each storage condition and time point correctly
reported “GBS Positive.” Of the 254 tests (including external controls), 4 (1.6%) provided
non-determinate GeneXpert results (3 INVALID and 1 ERROR). Samples with the non-
determinate results were repeated such that the required number of valid test results were
obtained. Each of the positive and negative external controls run daily during the study
reported the expected GeneXpert test results.
The data support a claim of maximum elapsed time between sample addition and cartridge
processing up to 4.5 hours, including a prepared cartridge hold time of 4 hours on the
GeneXpert Infinity instrument.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
