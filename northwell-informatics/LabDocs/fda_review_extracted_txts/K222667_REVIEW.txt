Wisdiag Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup offers any combinations from 2 to 15 drugs of abuse tests
but only one cutoff concentration under the same drug condition will be included per device. It is
for in vitro diagnostic use only. It is intended for OTC use.
The tests may yield positive results for the prescription drugs Buprenorphine, Nortriptyline,
Oxazepam, Secobarbital, Propoxyphene, and Oxycodone when taken at or above prescribed
doses. It is not intended to distinguish between prescription use of abuse of these drugs. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result.
The tests provide only preliminary results. To obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more
specific alternate chemical method must be used. GC/MS or LC/MS is the recommended
confirmatory method.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx and OTC
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable; this is a visually read single use device.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Wisdiag Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup and Wisdiag Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup Rx are rapid,
single-use in vitro diagnostic devices. Each test kit contains; a drug test cup (inside foil pouch),
user instruction sheet, an identification label and a specimen mailing box and bag.
B Principle of Operation:
The immunochromatographic assays of Wisdiag Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup tests use a lateral
flow, one step system for the qualitative detection of target analytes in human urine.
When urine sample is added to the cup device, urine is absorbed into the test strip and migrates
upwards by capillary action. If the concentration of target drug presented in the urine sample is
below the cutoff level, the target drug will not saturate the binding sites of its specific
monoclonal antibody-coated particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by
K222667 - Page 4 of 22

--- Page 5 ---
immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored band will be formed on the test line region. If
the concentration of target is beyond the cutoff level, the target drug will saturate the binding
sites of its specific monoclonal antibody-particles, thus the antibody-coated particles will not be
captured by immobilized drug-conjugate hence no colored band will be formed on the test line
region. A band should be formed on the control line region regardless of the presence of target
drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been performed properly.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cutoff, - 75%
cut off, -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff, cutoff, +25% cutoff, +50% cutoff, +75% cutoff and
+100% cutoff. Samples with concentration of -100% cutoff were drug-free urines samples.
Other samples were prepared by spiking target drug in drug-free urine samples. Each drug
concentration was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. For each concentration, tests were conducted in
singlicate in two (2) runs per day for twenty-five (25) days using three (3) lots of test cups.
The results of all combined lots are summarized in the following tables:

2. Linearity:
Not applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-Reactivity:
Percent cross-reactivity, provided in the below table, was calculated as the minimum
concentration of analyte tested that yielded a Percent cross-reactivity that was calculated as
(cut-off concentration / lowest concentration of cross reactant that gives a positive result) x
100. Compounds that did not yield a positive result at the highest concentration tested have
relative cross reactivity results represented by a dash in the table below. Cross-reactivity for
this device was determined through adding the potential interfering substances to drug-free
urine samples.

Interference Study:
Potential interference from compounds chemically dissimilar to the target drugs and from
endogenous agents was performed by spiking the substances into pooled urine containing
target drugs at near-cutoff concentrations (at +25% and -25% of cutoff). Substances were
tested for potential interference at concentrations of 100 μg/mL with the exception of
albumin that was tested at 100 mg/dL, and ethanol that was tested at 1%. The following
substances demonstrated no positive or negative interference on the assays encompassed in
this submission.
Acetaminophen Acetophenetidin Acetylsalicylic Acid
Acyclovir Amiodarone Hydrochloride Apomorphine
Afrin Albumin Amlodipine Mesylate
Aminophylline Amoxicillin Aripiprazole

pH and Specific Gravity:
Interference by pH and specific gravity were also evaluated using pooled urine specimens
containing target drugs at near-cutoff concentrations (at +25% and -25% of cutoff). The
results demonstrated that pH levels of 4 to 9 and specific gravity levels of 1.000 to 1.035 do
not affect the results of the assays.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
For characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration, please refer to section VII.A.1 (Precision study), above.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The device is traceable to commercially available reference materials.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison study of the Wisdiag Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup Rx was performed
by three (3) operators with eighty (80) unaltered urine samples (40 negative and 40 positive).
Each sample was tested in a blinded fashion by each operator and compared to LC-MS/MS
results. The results are shown in the table below.

MOP 2000 (OPI), COC 300). Each participant was provided one package insert, one test
solution, and one test device. Test solutions were randomly assigned to participants, one
solution per participant and were tested in a blinded fashion. Following testing, users
completed a study questionnaire to assess usability and user comprehension, and the results
from this questionnaire were found to be acceptable. Participants aged 20 and over, with
diverse educational backgrounds, were recruited. Results from the lay user testing are
