B Measurand:
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV Assay detects SARS-CoV-2, influenza A,
influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swab specimens
from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.
C Type of Test:
This assay is a multiplex nucleic acid assay that detects and differentiates SARS-CoV-2,
influenza A, influenza B, and RSV through nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection
using real-time RT-PCR. All steps of the assay are automated, after the manual addition of
sample into the sample lysis tube (SLT) and performed within the Panther and Panther Fusion
system.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV Assay:
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is a fully automated multiplexed real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test intended for the qualitative
detection and differentiation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
influenza A virus (Flu A), influenza B virus (Flu B), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
Nucleic acids are isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens obtained from
individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. Clinical signs and
symptoms of respiratory viral infection due to SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV can be similar.
This assay is intended to aid in the differential diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and
RSV infections in humans and is not intended to detect influenza C virus infections.
Nucleic acids from the viral organisms identified by this test are generally detectable in NP
specimens during the actute phase of infection. The detection and identification of specific viral
nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection are
indicative of the presence of the identified virus and aids in diagnosis if used in conjunction with
other clinical and epidemiological information, and laboratory findings. The results of this test
should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management
decisions.
Positive results do not rule out coinfection with other organisms. The organism(s) detected by
the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay may not be the definite cause of disease.
Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, or RSV
infections. This assay is designed for use on the Panther Fusion system.
The Hologic RespDirect Collection Kit can be used to collect NP specimens for testing with the
Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV Assay. Additionally, other NP swabs (not provided
with the Hologic RespDirect Collection Kit) may be used to collect NP specimens in 3mL of
VTM or UTM.

D Special Instrument Requirements:

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV Assay
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is a multiplex real-time reverse
transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test developed for use on the fully automated
Panther Fusion system to detect and differentiate SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) directly from nasopharyngeal swab specimens.
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay cartridge contains the same sample
preparation and PCR reaction chemistry as the previously cleared Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV
assay (K171963). To accommodate addition of the SARS-CoV-2 reagents (primers/probes) to
the multiplexed reagents, minor changes were made to the previously cleared analyte
primer/probe concentrations and RFU cutoffs. Additionally, the fluorophore for Flu B was
changed from ROX to RED647 to accommodate the addition of SARS-CoV-2 to the assay.
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay involves the following steps:
a. Sample lysis - Prior to processing and testing on the Panther Fusion system, specimens are
transferred to a Specimen Lysis Tube (SLT) containing specimen transport media (STM).
Alternatively, samples can be collected with the RespDirect Collection kit which
contains enhanced specimen transport media (eSTM). STM and eSTM lyse the cells, release
target nucleic acid and protect them from degradation during storage.
b. Nucleic acid capture and elution - These steps take place in a single tube on the Panther
Fusion system. The eluate is transferred to the Panther Fusion system reaction tube
containing the assay reagents. The Internal Control-S (IC-S) is added to each test specimen
and controls via the working Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). The IC-S in the
reagent is used to monitor specimen processing, amplification, and detection. Magnetic
particles with covalently bound oligonucleotides mediate the nucleic acid capture. Capture
oligonucleotides hybridize to total nucleic acid in the test specimen. Hybridized nucleic acid
K222736 - Page 3 of 33

--- Page 4 ---
is then separated from the lysed specimen in a magnetic field. Wash and aspiration steps
remove extraneous components debris from the reaction tube. The elution step elutes purified
nucleic acid.
c. Elution transfer and multiplex RT-PCR - Eluted nucleic acid is transferred to a Panther
Fusion reaction tube already containing oil and reconstituted master mix. A reverse
transcriptase generates a DNA copy of the target sequence. Target specific forward and
reverse primers and probes then amplify targets while simultaneously detecting and
discriminating multiple target types via multiplex RT-PCR. The Panther Fusion system
compares the fluorescence signal to a predetermined cut-off to produce a qualitative result
for the presence or absence of the analyte. The positive result for each analyte will be
accompanied by the cycle threshold (Ct value).
Hologic RespDirect Collection Kit
An ancillary collection kit that consists of the RespDirect Swab, intended for collection of NP
specimens, and the enhanced Direct Load Tube (eDLT), containing enhanced specimen transport
media (eSTM). This transport media lyses cells, releasing target nucleic acids and protecting
them from degradation during storage.
B Principle of Operation:
The assay detects viral nucleic acids that have been extracted from a patient respiratory sample.
A multiplex Real-time RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions generating
amplicons for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. The Internal Control-S (IC-S)
is added to each test specimen before processing to act as a control for specimen processing,
amplification, and detection. Identification of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, RSV,
and the IC-S occurs by the use of target-specific primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that
hybridize to conserved regions in the viral genomes (Table 1).

4. Calibration:
Real Time Fluorometers (RTF) undergo a single calibration during manufacturing. No
additional calibration is performed by the end user.
5. Quality Control:
The assay contains an internal control (IC-S) which is added to each test specimen via the
working Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). The IC-S is used to monitor
specimen processing, amplification, and detection.
Two external controls are also included with this assay in a single use vial, the Panther
Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV Positive Control and the Panther Fusion Negative
Control. The controls were validated in the analytical and clinical studies.

the target analytes were prepared in negative clinical NPS matrix. The viral materials
used to generate the positive panel members are denoted in Table 2. The contrived
positive panels consisted of combinations of the target analytes at low concentrations (2x
LoD) and moderate concentrations (5x LoD) (Table 3). The study was conducted with
two operators, three lots of reagents, and three Panther Fusion instruments over the
course of 12 days. Each panel member was tested in duplicate by each operator on two
different reagent lots on all 12 days generating a total of 96 replicates per panel member
(2 operators x 2 replicates per test event x 2 lots x 12 days).

Ct = cycle threshold; CV = coefficient of variation; Mod = moderate; Pos = positive; SD = standard
deviation . Note: Variability from some factors may be numerically negative, which can occur if the
variability due to those factors is very small. When this occurs, SD=0 and CV=0%
The mean and variability analysis between instruments, between reagent lots, between
operators, between days, between runs, within runs, and overall (total) for Ct values is
shown in Table 5. Overall %CV was ≤ 2.04%. The greatest source of
variability was from SARS-CoV-2 in the Flu A and SARS-CoV-2 low positive panel
(within-run % CV of 1.67%). Overall variability was low, and the study demonstrates
assay variability within an acceptable range.
b. Reproducibility
A reproducibility study was conducted at three testing sites using the Panther Fusion
SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay. The study incorporated potential sources of variation
introduced by site (three testing sites), day (5 different days), and operator (two operators
per site). One lot of Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay reagents was
tested at three sites by two operators per site on one Panther Fusion instrument per site
over five days.
A total of 6 contrived panels containing known quantities of various Panther Fusion
SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay analytes were prepared in negative clinical NPS
matrix. The same viral materials used in the precision study (see Table 2) were also
included in the reproducibility study. The four contrived positive panels consisted of
combinations of the target analytes at low concentrations (i.e., 1-2x LoD) and moderate
concentrations (3-5x LoD) (Table 6). Three replicates of each panel member were tested
by each operator at each site on all 5 days of testing generating a total of 90 replicates per
panel member. The qualitative and quantitative results of the study are illustrated in
Table 7 and Table 8, respectively.

The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay demonstrated 100% agreement for
SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV moderate positive panel members. For low
positive panel members, the assay yielded 100% agreement for SARS-CoV-2, Flu B, and
RSV detection and 98.9% agreement for Flu A detection (Table 7 above). A lower
agreement for low positive panel members was expected, since the analyte concentration
of their panel member analytes ranged between 1x and 2x the limit of detection, which is
expected to yield >95% detection rate. This performance is acceptable and demonstrates
acceptable assay reproducibility.

variability due to those factors is very small. When this occurs, SD=0 and CV=0%
1Between-Operator may be confounded with Between-Run; therefore, Between-Operator and
Between-Run estimates are combined in Between-Operator/Run
The total signal variability, as measured by the standard deviation, was less than or equal to
0.65 across all target viruses and concentrations, with the exception of the Flu A low positive
panel member (SD =3.77), which may be attributed to 1 false negative result (Table 8
above). For all positive panel members, the within-run factor (i.e., random error) was the
largest contributor to total variability. These results indicate that the repeatability and
reproducibility of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay on the Panther
Fusion system are robust in NPS samples.

Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
a. Wet-Testing
This study was performed to determine the analytical reactivity of the Panther Fusion
SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay with clinically relevant strains, serotypes, or subtypes
of the target species (i.e., SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV). The inclusivity panel
was prepared by spiking various SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/Flu B/RSV virus
serotypes/subtypes/strains encompassing temporal and geographical diversity into
negative clinical NP swab VTM/UTM matrix at a concentration of ~3x LoD and testing
in triplicate. Strains that did not yield 100% reactivity at 3x LoD were prepared at higher
concentrations and tested until the minimum concentration that achieved 100% reactivity
was reached. The strains evaluated and the lowest concentration that achieved 100%
reactivity are shown in Table 9, below.

The results from this study demonstrate that the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu
A/B/RSV assay is capable of detecting multiple clinically relevant strains of SARS-CoV-
2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV.
b. In silico
The inclusivity of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was evaluated
using in silico analysis of the forward primers, reverse primers, and probes for the
SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B and RSV target systems in relation to sequences available
in the NCBI and GISAID gene databases. For SARS-CoV-2, all available sequences
up to June 25, 2022 from the GISAID and NCBI gene databases were evaluated. Due
to the large size of the database (>9.3 million sequences) every 1 out of 10 sequences

was randomly sampled from each database. For Flu A, Flu B, RSV A, and RSV B, all
available sequences from GISAID and NCBI gene databases entered from January 1,
2015 to February 15, 2022 were evaluated. In total, 934,493 SARS-CoV-2 and 88,128
Flu A sequences were evaluated that contained both assay target regions, while an
additional 31,801 Flu B sequences, 1,599 RSV A sequences, and 1,240 RSV B
sequences containing the assay single target region were included in the analysis. The
SARS-CoV-2 sequences included the following lineages and variants of concern
(VOC) or variants of interest (VOI) that may have important epidemiological,
immunological, or pathogenic properties from a public health perspective: Delta,
Alpha, Omicron BA.1, Omicron BA.2, Omicron BA.4, Omicron BA.5, Gamma,
Epsilon, Iota, Beta, Mu, Zeta, Kappa, Eta, Lamba, Theta and others.
Sequence alignments were generated using the multiple sequence alignment program
MAFFT (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform). All non-human isolates
were removed from the analysis. Additionally, any sequence with missing or
ambiguous sequence information for the target region was removed. Due to the dual
amplification systems for SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A, only sequences with mismatches
in both regions were assessed for potential impact to the inclusivity of the assay.
Based on the in silico analysis of GISAID and NCBI sequences available up to June
25, 2022 for SARS-CoV-2, the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is
predicted to detect all 934,493 SARS-CoV-2 sequences evaluated.
Based on in silico analysis of all sequences available from January 01, 2015 to
February 15, 2022 in GISAID and NCBI databases, the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-
2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is predicted to detect ≥99.998% of 88,128 Flu A, ≥99.94% of
31,801 Flu B, ≥98.12% of 1,599 RSV A, and ≥98.23% of 1,240 RSV B sequences
evaluated.
Exclusivity Testing
This study was performed to demonstrate that non-indicated influenza subtypes,
specifically influenza C and D, are not detected by the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu
A/B/RSV assay. For this study, one Flu C strain (C/Taylor/1233/1947) and one Flu D
strain (Bovine/Mississippi/C00046N/14) were diluted into negative clinical NP swab
matrix at 1x105 CEID /mL and 1x104 TCID /mL concentrations, respectively. Seven
50 50
replicates were tested for both strains and no positive results were obtained for any of the
assay’s target channels, demonstrating that Flu C and Flu D are not detected by the assay.
Cross-Reactivity/Microbial Interference
a. Wet-Testing
This study evaluated the analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) and sensitivity of the
Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay in the presence of non-targeted
microorganisms that may be found in a respiratory tract clinical specimen. Forty-one (41)
non-target microorganisms (Table 10) were evaluated in the study. Panel members were
composed of 3 different non-target microorganisms spiked into negative clinical NP swab
VTM/UTM matrix at 103-106 TCID /mL or copies/mL (for viruses), 105-108 CFU/mL or
50
rRNA copies/mL (for bacteria) or 106 CFU/mL (for fungi). To evaluate cross-reactivity,
each panel was evaluated in triplicate in the absence of the target organisms. To evaluate
K222736 - Page 15 of 33

--- Page 16 ---
microbial interference (negative effect on sensitivity), each panel was tested in triplicate
in the presence of SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV at 3x LoD. The organisms
evaluated in the study are shown in the table below. No cross-reactivity or microbial
interference was observed at the concentrations tested.

b. In silico
An in silico analysis was performed to demonstrate that the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-
2/Flu A/B/RSV assay does not cross-react with closely related or commonly encountered
microorganisms in a respiratory clinical specimen. A total of 545 individual sequences
from GenBank, associated with 143 microorganisms, were analyzed with BLAST for
homology to the primer and probe sequences for the SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, RSV A,
and RSV B targets included in the assay. A microorganism was determined to have no
cross-reactivity when its sequence had <80% homology with all of the assay’s primers
and probes. When ≥80% homology was identified for a single primer or probe, proximity
and mismatch analysis was used to demonstrate minimal likelihood of amplicon
generation and/or detection. Specifically, microorganism sequences showing >80%

homology to a single primer or probe and <50% homology to the other primer/probe,
were not expected to be amplified. For microorganism sequences showing >80%
homology to a single primer or probe and >50% homology to the other primer/probe,
proximity analysis was performed to determine the likelihood of amplification.
Seven organisms showed ≥80% homology to one of the primers and ≥50% homology to a
second primer and probe. Six of these organisms were determined to be low risk and
unlikely to cross-react due to proximity analysis. The remaining organism, SARS-1
coronavirus, was identified as having a small possibility of amplification due to a high
level of homology to the primers and probe in the SARS-CoV-2 channel. However,
mismatches at the 3’ end of the primers suggest that hybridization and amplification is
unlikely. This observation was confirmed in a cross-reactivity wet-testing study
performed at high concentrations (1.01x106 copies/mL) of SARS-1 coronavirus, which
demonstrated SARS-1 coronavirus does not cross react with any of the target assays.
A total of 29 organisms showed ≥80% homology to one of the primers, ≥50% homology
to a second primer, but <50% homology to a probe. Twenty-seven of these organisms
were determined to be low risk and unlikely to interfere with assay analytes due to
proximity, mismatches at the 3’end of the primers, low homology to at least 1 primer,
and/or <10 continuous bases between the target and primers. Serratia marcescens was
identified as having a possibility of low amplification without detection. To determine if
S. marcescens cross-reacted with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay,
wet-testing was performed at high concentrations (1x106 CFU/mL) of S. marcescens. No
cross-reactivity was observed at the concentrations tested.
Interfering Substances
This study evaluated the performance of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV
assay in the presence of medications, over the counter products, and other potentially
interfering substances found in a clinical respiratory specimen. Assay results were evaluated
to determine if the presence of potentially interfering substances in target analyte negative or
target analyte positive samples had an effect on assay performance. The analyte negative
pools contained negative NP swab VTM/UTM clinical matrix and the potentially interfering
substances, only. The analyte positive pools contained negative NP swab VTM/UTM
clinical matrix, the potentially interfering substance(s), and one representative strain of each
targeted analyte (i.e., SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV B) spiked to a final testing
concentration of 3x LoD. Three replicates were tested per pool both in the presence and
absence of the target analytes. The substances evaluated are denoted in Table 11 below. All
target-spiked panels were 100% positive, and all target-negative panels were 100% negative,
indicating that none of the evaluated substances interfered with the Panther Fusion SARS-
CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay.

Competitive Interference
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that samples tested with the Panther Fusion
SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay that are co-infected with multiple types of targeted
microorganisms do not inhibit the detection of either one (competitive interference). One
representative strain of each targeted organism (SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B and RSV) was
tested. Co-infection panels were made by spiking one target organism at high concentration
(up to 10,000 TCID /mL) and another target organism at low concentration (~3x LoD) in
50
negative clinical NP swab clinical matrix. If less than 100% positivity was observed for the
low target, the high target was diluted down from 10,000 TCID /mL to a concentration
50
where 100% positivity of the low target was achieved. The on-target analyte combinations
evaluated and the results of this evaluation, are shown in Table 12.

Processed Specimen (NPS storage in a Panther Fusion SLT)
Once a patient specimen in VTM/UTM is transferred to the Panther Fusion SLT, samples
can be stored under the following conditions:
• Room temperature (15-30˚C) for up to 6 days or,
• Refrigerated (2-8˚C) for up to 3 months or,
• Frozen at -20˚C for up to 3 months. Freeze/thaw cycles should be minimized due
to potential for sample degradation.
• Frozen at -70˚C for up to 3 months. Freeze/thaw cycles should be minimized due
to potential for sample degradation.
RespDirect Collection Kit (eSTM)
A NPS specimen collected with the RespDirect Collection Kit can be stored under the
following conditions:
• Room temperature (15-30˚C) for up to 6 days or,
• Refrigerated (2-8˚C) for up to 3 months or,
• Frozen at -20˚C for up to 3 months. Samples may be freeze/thawed up to 3 times
prior to testing or,
• Frozen at -70˚C for up to 3 months. Samples may be freeze/thawed up to 3 times
prior to testing.
c. Kit Stability
Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV Reagents
Stability of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay cartridge and positive
control were evaluated. Stability of universal Panther Fusion respiratory assay fluids (i.e.,
Panther Fusion Capture Reagents-S, Panther Fusion Enhancer Reagent-S, Panther Fusion
Internal Control-S, Panther Fusion Elution Buffer, Panther Fusion Oil, Panther Fusion
Reconstitution Buffer 1, and the negative control) were not assessed, as stability for these
reagents has been previously established for Panther Fusion respiratory assays, including
the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay (K171963). Two types of stability studies were
performed: Shelf-Life Stability and In-Use (or On-Board) Stability. The study data
supports the storage conditions for the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV Assay
Cartridge and Positive Control illustrated in Table 13.

d. Shipping Stability
Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV Reagents
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that exposure to extreme hot or cold
temperatures potentially encountered by the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-/Flu A/B/RSV
assay components during shipment would not impact the performance of the assay. One
lot of cartridges and positive controls for the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-/Flu A/B/RSV
assay were tested in this study. Similar to the Kit Stability Study (see Section c. Kit
Stability, Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV Reagents, above), stability of
the universal Panther Fusion respiratory assay fluids were not assessed, as stability for
these reagents has previously been shown. Components were exposed to the extreme
temperatures in their final container closure systems.
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-/Flu A/B/RSV assay cartridges and positive controls
were cycled between the extreme low temperature (-40 ±3°C), room temperature (28
±2°C), and extreme high temperature (55 ±5°C). One stress cycle consisted of incubation
for at least 9 hours at extreme high temperatures and then at least 15 hours at room-
temperature, followed by at least 9 hours at extreme low temperature, followed by at least
15 hour incubation at room temperature (1 cycle = approx. 48 hours). A total of 5 cycles
were performed to evaluate the worst case scenario of shipment to customers.
All runs tested gave the expected result for spiked and un-spiked samples. This study
demonstrates that Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-/Flu A/B/RSV assay cartridge and positive
control are not altered by exposure to extreme hot or cold temperatures that may be
encountered during shipping.
RespDirect Collection Kit
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that exposure to extreme hot or cold
temperatures potentially encountered by the RespDirect Collection Kit during shipment
would not impact performance of the RespDirect when tested with the Panther Fusion
SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay. One RespDirect Collection Kit lot was tested in this
study. For this study, RespDirect Collection Kits were exposed to extreme temperatures
in their final container closure systems.
RespDirect Collection Kits were cycled between the extreme low temperature (-70°C,
ranging from -65°C to -85°C), room temperature (28 ±2°C), and extreme high
temperature (55 ±5°C). One stress cycle consisted of incubation for at least 24 hours at
extreme low temperatures and then at least 4 hours at room-temperature, followed by 24
hours at extreme high temperatures and then 4 hours at room-temperature (1 cycle =
approx. 56 hours). A total of 5 cycles were performed to evaluate the worst case scenario
of shipment to customers.

All runs tested gave the expected result for spiked and un-spiked samples, except for one
spiked sample at 3x LoD that was negative for SARS-CoV-2. This study demonstrates
that the RespDirect Collection Kit is not altered by exposure to extreme hot or cold
temperatures that may be encountered during shipping.
6. Detection Limit:
Processed Specimens (i.e., NP Swab Specimen in VTM/UTM Diluted into Panther Fusion
Specimen Lysis Tube, containing STM)
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu
A/B/RSV assay was determined by testing processed negative clinical NP swab matrix
spiked with multiple concentrations of the WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2
(NIBSC, 20/146) or viral cultures of SARS-CoV-2 (1 strain), Influenza A (one H1N1 and
one H3N2 strain), Influenza B (one Victoria lineage and one Yamagata lineage), and RSV
(one RSV A and one RSV B strain). To estimate the LoD, a minimum of 24 replicates were
tested per concentration with each of three reagent lots. Using the estimated LoD study
results, the LoD for each target was further estimated by Probit analysis for each reagent lot
and was confirmed with an additional 24 replicates using a single reagent lot. The
concentration with >95% detection was determined to be the final, confirmed LoD for each
assay target. Confirmed LoD concentrations for each analyte are summarized in Table 15.

and one RSV B strain) were evaluated. Thirty (30) replicates were tested for each
concentration/RespDirect Collection Kit workflow. The RespDirect Collection Kit can be
handled according to the following workflows described in the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-
2/Flu A/B/RSV assay IFU: (1) directly load tube on the Panther Fusion Instrument or, (2)
vortex the tube for 10 minutes at 1,800 rpm on a multi-tube vortexer prior to loading on the
Panther Fusion Instrument or, (3) vortex tube for 15 seconds using a standard bench top
vortexer prior to loading on the Panther Fusion Instrument. The concentration with >95%
detection was determined to be the final, confirmed LoD for each of the assay targets. The
RespDirect Collection Kit workflows yielded equivalent LoDs for each assay target. The
LoD concentrations for each analyte are outlined below.
• SARS-CoV-2, WHO International Standard (NIBSC, 20/146): 98.6 IU/mL
• Influenza A (H3N2): 0.11 TCID /mL
50
• Influenza B (Victoria lineage): 0.03 TCID /mL
50
• RSV A: 0.03 TCID /mL
50
• RSV B: 0.05 TCID /mL
50
The LoD for co-analyte spiked samples was also evaluated and shown to be equivalent to
single analyte spiked samples.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The relative fluorescence units (RFU) range is the difference between maximum and
minimum fluorescent signal seen in a sample during amplification. For Panther Fusion
SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV positive samples, the amplification curve rises above the
background florescence RFU resulting in a high RFU range for the intended targets. The IC
resembles a positive target and also has a high RFU range. For the Panther Fusion SARS-
CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV negative samples, the amplification curve remains flat resulting in a
low RFU range for the intended targets. This difference in RFU range is the primary criteria
used to distinguish positive and negative specimens. RFU range thresholds were set at 500
for SARS-CoV-2, 1,000 for Flu A, 1000 for Flu B, and 775 for RSV for determination of
positivity in their specific channels (ROX, FAM, RED647, HEX, respectively) and 1000
RFU range for IC for determination of validity in its specific channel (RED677). The RFU
range thresholds were set based on data from multiple RFU readings from known positive
samples. The cycle number at which the amplification curve crosses target specific assigned
RFU range threshold value is called Ct. Target specific Ct will be generated only for positive
valid reaction for that target.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable
9. Carry-Over:
RespDirect Collection Kit
Carry-over/cross-contamination with processed specimens (i.e., NP specimens in VTM/UTM
diluted into STM) was previously evaluated in K171963 and found acceptable. Therefore,
carry-over/cross-contamination with processed specimens was not evaluated with the Panther
Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay.
K222736 - Page 24 of 33

--- Page 25 ---
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that no carry-over/cross-contamination is
observed for NP specimens collected in eSTM using the RespDirect Collection Kit when
tested with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay.
Carry-over or cross-contamination in the RespDirect Collection Kit was assessed with pooled
negative clinical matrix collected in RespDirect Collection Kits. Pooled negative clinical
matrix were used to prepare negative and high-titer positive panels. A high-titer positive
panel was prepared by spiking one strain of Flu A (H3N2, Kansas/14/17) in negative clinical
matrix at a concentration of 1 x 104 TCID /mL. Non-spiked negative clinical matrix was
50
used as the negative panel. Panels were tested in a checkboard pattern by alternating high-
titer positive and negative samples over 5 total runs on each of two Panther Fusion
instruments. Each run included 30 positive and 30 negative reactions (60 total reactions). A
baseline run of 100 negative reactions was run prior to the checkerboard pattern runs. One lot
of Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 /Flu A/B/RSV assay cartridges was used. No carry-over was
observed.

a. Transport Media Equivalency Study
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate equivalency between viral transport media
types indicated for use with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay. The
following transport media types were included in the study: Remel Micro Test M4RT,
Remel Micro Test M5, Remel Micro Test M6, BD Universal Viral Transport Media,
Copan Universal Transport Medium, and Hardy Diagnostics Viral Transport Media. To
demonstrate equivalency between the viral transport medias, contrived positive samples
were created by spiking one strain of SARS-CoV-2, Flu A H3N2, Flu B Victoria, and
RSV B into either true negative clinical NP swab matrix or simulated NP swab matrix
(i.e., transport media spiked with HeLa cells at a concentration of 2x104 cells/mL) at 3
concentrations (0.5x, 1x, and 5x LoD). Flu A, Flu B, and RSV B were co-spiked while
SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated independently. Contrived positives generated with true
clinical NP matrix were included to demonstrate equivalency between clinical NP matrix
and simulated NP matrix, supporting the use of simulated viral transport media in the
study. Twenty (20) replicates per target concentration were tested for each transport
media type and analyte concentration. The results are shown in Table 16 and support that
the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B RSV assay can be used with the evaluated
viral transport media types.

b. Collection Device Equivalency – RespDirect Collection Kit (eSTM) vs. VTM/UTM
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate equivalency between two collection
devices: (1) NP specimens collected into VTM/UTM and (2) NP specimens collected
with the RespDirect Collection Kit (eSTM). For this study, contrived positive panels
were prepared by adding one strain each of SARS-CoV-2 (WHO International Standard),
Flu A (H3N2), Flu B (Victoria), and RSV B into paired, negative clinical NP eSTM and
negative clinical NP VTM/UTM matrix collected from individuals with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection. Contrived panels were generated at both 2x and 5x
LoD. SARS-CoV-2 was co-spiked with Flu A, Flu B, and RSV and was also tested
independently. In total, 100 SARS-CoV-2 positives and 50 positives each for Flu A, Flu
B, and RSV were evaluated. Additionally, 181 negative samples, consisting of negative

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Prospective Study
The clinical performance of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was
established in a multi-center study conducted with residual (leftover) and de-identified
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens in VTM or UTM that were prospectively collected
from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infections during periods of the
2020-2022 respiratory illness seasons. NPS specimens, from five geographically diverse
clinical sites in the U.S., were enrolled and tested with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu
A/B/RSV assay at three U.S. testing sites.
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2
performance by comparing the candidate device testing results to a composite comparator
algorithm (CCA) consisting of two highly sensitive U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2 molecular
tests and a validated PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing (PCR/BDS) assay. A final
CCA result was assigned when two of the three composite comparator assays were in
concordance. The comparator method utilized to establish performance for the Flu A, Flu B,
and RSV targets was a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular Flu A/B/RSV assay. All comparator
testing was performed in accordance with the respective package inserts.
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV was evaluated with prospectively (i.e., all
comers between two time points that met the clinical study inclusion criteria) collected
specimens. Both Category I specimens (i.e., prospectively collected, tested fresh) and
Category II specimens (i.e., prospectively collected, tested frozen) were included in the
study.
A total of 1949 residual NPS specimens were acquired and enrolled for the prospective
clinical study. Of these 1949 specimens, 1056 were collected between January 2022 and

March 2022, while the remaining 893 were collected between November 2020 and March
2021. Forty-five (45) of these specimens were withdrawn from the study because of a
reception delay that resulted in frozen specimens being received thawed (n=44) or a specimen
not being handled according to the package insert (n=1). In addition, another 4 specimens
were withdrawn because they yielded invalid results with the investigational device upon
retesting (n=4), bringing the total number of withdrawn samples to forty-nine. The initial
prospective clinical study invalid rate was 0.6% (12/1904), and 0.2% (4/1904) following
retesting.
This left 1900 prospective specimens enrolled in the evaluable population. For the SARS-
CoV-2 target, 13 specimens were excluded from analysis due to unknown infection status
obtained from the CCA tests. This left a total of 1887 prospective samples evaluated for
SARS-CoV-2, of which 790 (41.9%) were tested fresh and 1097 (58.1%) which were tested
frozen with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay. For the Flu A, Flu B, and
RSV targets, 63 specimens were excluded from analysis due to obtaining an invalid result
from the comparator test. This left a total of 1837 valid prospective specimens evaluated for
Flu A, Flu B, and RSV, of which 798 (43.4%) were tested fresh and 1039 (56.6%) were
tested frozen with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay. Table 18 below
provides a summary of demographic information for the 1900 specimens included in the
prospective clinical study.

A summary of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay prospective clinical
study performance is provided in Table 19. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was
calculated as 100% × (TP / (TP + FN)). True positive (TP) indicates that both the Panther
Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay and the comparator method had a positive result
for the specific analyte, and false negative (FN) indicates that the Panther Fusion SARS-
CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV was negative while the comparator result was positive. Negative
Percent Agreement (NPA) was calculated as 100% × (TN / (TN + FP)). True negative (TN)
indicates that both the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay and the comparator
method had negative results, and false positive (FP) indicates that the Panther Fusion SARS-
CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was positive while the comparator result was negative.
Specimens that obtained discordant results underwent additional testing with a U.S. FDA
EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test, when sufficient sample volume remained.

Retrospective Clinical Study
Flu B and RSV were of low prevalence and were not encountered in sufficiently large
numbers during the prospective clinical study to adequately demonstrate assay performance.
To supplement the results of the prospective clinical study, an evaluation of 95 preselected
archived retrospective specimens was performed. These specimens were archived NPS in
VTM or UTM that were collected between December 2019 and March 2020. Specimens
were selected for enrollment in the study based solely on the historic qualitative result. In
addition to evaluating Flu B and RSV positive specimens, Flu A positive specimens and
negative specimens were included in the study. The 95 samples were distributed uniformly
across all three clinical testing sites. A summary of the demographic information of the tested
retrospective samples is provided in Table 21 below.
