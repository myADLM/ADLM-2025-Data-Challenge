(Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) in a single test device. It is intended for use with cultures derived
from human stool specimens to aid in the diagnosis of disease caused by Shiga toxin producing
Escherichia coli (STEC) infections. Test results are to be used in conjunction with the patient’s
clinical symptoms and history.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The Curian Shiga Toxin assay can only be run on the Curian Analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Curian Shiga Toxin assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the detection of Shiga
toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) in cultures derived from human stool specimens. The
Curian Shiga Toxin assay utilizes fluorescence technology with the cleared Curian Analyzer
(K192817) to detect Stx1 and Stx2 in cultures derived from human stool.
The Curian Shiga Toxin assay kit contains the following components:
• Curian Shiga Toxin Test Card: A test strip enclosed in a plastic frame which is in a foil
pouch with a desiccant. The desiccant will appear pink; if the packaging is compromised,
the desiccant will be blue. Test steops are supplied ready to use.
• Curian Shiga Toxin Aioprep Sample Preparation Device/ Negative Control: A buffered
aqueous protein solution containing blue dye and 0.094% sodium azide. The Aioprep
device is fitted with a dropper tip. Test buffer is supplied ready to use.
• Curian Shiga Toxin Positive Control: Inactivated Shiga toxins 1 and 2 in an aqueous
phosphate buffered solution containing 0.094% sodium azide. The positive control buffer
is supplied ready to use.
• Pipette I: Transfer pipettes graduated to 50 μL and 175 μL.
• Pipette II: Transfer pipettes graduated up to 1.0 mL.
B Principle of Operation:
The Curian Shiga Toxin assay is a lateral flow-based fluorescent immunoassay for the direct
detection of Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) in cultures derived from human stool
specimens. The Curian Shiga Toxin assay is based on standard immunoassay sandwich
technology utilizing two detector antibodies (E. coli monoclonal antibodies specific to Stx1 or
Stx2, which are conjugated to Europium as a fluorescent tag), and three capture antibodies: (a)
anti-E. coli monoclonal antibodies specific to Stx1 or Stx2, which are affixed at the “Stx1 Test
Line” or “Stx2 Test Line” positions of the test strip, and (b) a polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG
antibody, which is affixed at the “Control Line” position of the test strip.
K222829 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
The Aioprep sampling device (the “Aioprep”) is pre-filled with blue tinted Sample Diluent /
Negative Control and contains a filter and a dropper tip. A sample of the patient’s culture
enriched stool specimen is transferred from the enrichment media to the Aioprep, using either the
included transfer pipettes (Pipette II) or a polyester swab (not provided with the kit) to add the
sample directly into the Sample Diluent / Negative Control. The diluted sample is mixed directly
in the Aioprep barrel and then dispensed drop-wise into the sample port of the Curian Shiga
Toxin test card.
If Stx1 and/or Stx2 antigens are present in the sample, they bind to the respective monoclonal
detector antibodies conjugated to fluorescent particles, forming a complex. As the complex
moves through the test strip, the anti-Shiga toxin 1 and/or 2 monoclonal capture antibodies, each
bound to the assay membrane at their respective Stx1 and Stx2 test positions of the strip, bind the
complexes to yield the respective test lines. When antigen is not present, a complex is not
formed, and therefore, test lines do not form. As the sample continues to move further up the test
strip, the polyclonal capture antibody, bound to the assay membrane at the control position of the
strip, binds the conjugated antibodies and yields the control line. A line at the control position of
the test strip should be present each time a sample or external control is tested. If the control line
is not generated, adequate sample flow has not occurred, and the Curian Analyzer will consider
the test invalid. The output is a reported test result produced by the Curian Analyzer, indicating if
Stx1 and/or Stx2 has been detected. The assay detects and differentiates between Stx1 and Stx2
in a single test device.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the Curian Shiga Toxin assay was assessed across three external testing
sites. Each site conducted testing using three Curian Shiga Toxin kit lots on three
independent Curian Analyzers (one per site). Testing was performed by two operators per
site over the course of five days for a total of 900 data points (300 per site). Each operator
was supplied with a panel of blinded specimens prior to testing. The specimen panels were
tested according to the Curian Shiga Toxin package insert instructions.
Contrived panel samples were prepared by spiking purified and quantified toxin (Stx1 and
Stx2) into stool cultured negative MacConkey broth at antigen concentrations above, near,
and below the assay limit of detection for Shiga toxin. Samples were prepared in bulk
cultured negative MacConkey broth then diluted for consistency across all panels. For more
information on the use of MacConkey broth, see section VII.B.2 Matrix Comparison. Each
site received a total of 10 panels with each panel comprising 30 samples. Each panel
consisted of the following in triplicate:

High-Dose Hook Effect/Prozone
A high-dose hook effect (prozone) study was conducted to evaluate potential interference
from high concentrations of Shiga Toxin antigen. Contrived positive samples were prepared
by diluting purified and quantified Stx1 and Stx2 in negative cultured MacConkey broth and
tested in quintuplicate at concentrations ranging from 0.932 to 69.78 ng/mL for Stx1 and
0.932 to 69.78 ng/mL for Stx2. An additional sample was prepared for a contrived combined
Stx1 and Stx2 positive sample representing the highest concentration of Stx1 and Stx2 tested
individually (69.78 ng/mL). No false negative results suggestive of a high-does hook effect
were observed.
Analyze Now Mode and Incubate and Analyze Mode/Temperature Study
The purpose of this study was to document testing results of the Curian Shiga toxin assay in
Incubate and Analyze mode and Analyze Now read modes on the Curian Analyzer. In the
Incubate and Analyze mode, the cassette with loaded sample was developed for 20 minutes
on the bench top before insertion into the Curian Analyzer for scanning. In Analyze Now
mode, the cassette was placed in the Curian Analyzer immediately and developed for 20
minutes before scanning. Additionally, testing was performed at different ambient

temperatures, including each of the following environmental conditions: <19°C, 19-27°C,
and >27°C.
For this study, contrived samples and clinical specimens (both positive and negative for
Shiga toxin) were evaluated. Contrived samples were generated by spiking purified Shiga
toxin (Stx1 and Stx2) into negative cultured MacConkey broth at the LoD, 3x LoD and 5x
LoD. A sample was tested with Stx1 and Stx2 combined at 5x LoD. All positive and
negative samples were in 100% agreement with the expected results regardless of the
temperature and reading mode. This study demonstrated that the correct results can be
obtained with the Curian Shiga Toxin assay when the test materials are stored and tested at
temperatures from 19°C to 27°C in both Analyze Now Mode and Incubate and Analyze
Modes on the Curian Analyzer.
Two additional scenarios were tested to determine the effect of adding less than the
recommended sample to the card (2 drops vs 3 drops) and incubating for longer than
recommended time frames (up to 30 minutes vs recommended 20 minutes). The accuracy of
the assay was affected by these scenarios. The labeling was updated to indicate that failure to
add the recommended number of drops of prepared sample from the Aioprep onto the test
card may lead to invalid test results, and over incubation of tests may lead to false-positive or
invalid test results.

Assay Controls
Internal Control
Each Curian Shiga Toxin test card contains an internal control line to confirm correct sample
flow and active reagents for the test run. If the internal control line fluorescence does not
meet or exceed the cut-off level, the result is considered invalid and the test should be
repeated.
External Controls
The Curian Shiga Toxin positive and negative controls are recommended to be run with each
new kit shipment or lot. One vial of positive control reagent (purified antigen) is provided
with each test kit, and the kit sample diluent buffer serves as the negative control. The
positive and negative controls are intended to ensure that the kit is functional to produce the
expected results. The kit should not be used if either external control fails to deliver the
correct test results.
Stool Specimen Storage Stability
Studies were conducted to examine the stability of stool samples (unpreserved or preserved
in ThermoScientific Remel Cary-Blair or Para Pak C&S) when stored refrigerated (2°C to
8ºC) or frozen (-28°C to -16ºC) for defined periods of time. The contrived positive stool
samples contained an Stx1 and Stx2 positive E. coli strain at a concentration of 6.0E+07
CFU/mL. The results demonstrated that the organisms are viable after storage for up to two
K222829 - Page 9 of 13

hours refrigerated (2°C to 8ºC) and up to 14 days frozen (-28°C to -16ºC). Stools preserved
in ThermoScientific Remel Cary-Blair or Meridian Para Pak C&S can be stored for up to 5
days refrigerated (2°C to 8ºC) and up to 14 days frozen (-28°C to -16ºC) without impact to
organism viability.
Broth Culture Storage Stability
Studies were conducted to examine the stability of broth culture enriched stool specimens
when stored at three (3) different temperatures: refrigerated (2 to 8° C); -20° C (Freezer Type
2; -28 to -16° C), and -80° C (Freezer Type 1; -84 to -66° C) and defined time points.
Contrived positive broth samples contained 5X LoD, 2X LoD, and ˂ 1X LoD of Stx1 and
Stx2 purified antigen. The results demonstrated that toxin can be recovered after storage up
to 7 days at refrigerated temperature (2-8 C) or for up to 21 days frozen (-20°C and/or -80°C)
for clinical broth culture enriched stool specimens prior to testing.
Diluted Specimen Storage Stability
Studies were conducted to examine the stability of processed broth and plate cultures in the
AioPrep/Sample Dilutent stored at room temperature (19°C - 27°C) and refrigerated (2°C to
8°C) for defined time points prior to testing with the Curian Analyzer. Contrived positive
cultured broth samples were prepared by diluting purified and quantified Stx1 or Stx2 into
negative MacConkey broth to concentrations < 1x LoD, 2x LoD, and 5X LoD. Contrived
plate cultures were prepared using one non-toxigenic strain, one Stx1 positive strain, one
Stx2 positive strain, and a dual positive strain (Stx1 positive and Stx2 positive) plated to
SMAC. The study results for processed broth cultures supported recommendation of storage
of 8 hours or less at room temperature (19°C - 27°C) and 24 hours or less when refrigerated
(2°C to 8°C). The study results for processed plate cultures supported the recommendation
of storage of 2 hours or less at room temperature (19°C - 27°C) and 24 hours or less when
refrigerated (2°C to 8°C).
Broth Culture Freeze/Thaw Stability
Studies were conducted to examine the stability of the broth culture enriched stool specimens
when subjected to freeze/thaw cycles. Contrived positive broth samples contained 5X LoD,
2X LoD, and ˂ 1X LoD of Stx1 and Stx2 purified antigen. The study results for processed
plate cultures supported recommendation that cultured broth samples stored at -20ºC can
undergo no more than two freeze/thaw cycles.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Detection
The limit of detection (LoD) for the Curian Shiga Toxin test was determined by spiking
purified Shiga toxin (Stx1 and Stx2) into negative cultured MacConkey broth at known
concentrations. Three lots of the Curian Shiga Toxin assay were evaluated in the study. The
initial LoD was established by testing each of five dilutions in triplicate. The initial LoD
concentrations were confirmed by testing an additional 20 replicates at the target
concentrations. The LoD is the toxin concentration that yields a positive result 95% of the
time and a negative result 5% of the time. The LoD for the Curian Shiga toxin test was
determined to be 0.185 ng/mL for Stx1 and 0.125 ng/ml for Stx2.

Inclusivity Study
The reactivity of several clincial Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli strains (STEC) were
evaluated in the Curian Shiga Toxin assay by the Sorbitol MacConkey Agar (SMAC) plate,
Gram Negative (GN) broth, and MacConkey (MAC) broth culture enrichment methods.
Samples were prepared by placing one Microbank bead for each strain in each media type
(Gram Negative Broth, MacConkey Broth, and Sorbitol MacConkey Agar plates) and
culturing at 35 - 39° C for either 16 - 24 hours (for broth enrichment method) or 18 - 24
hours (for SMAC plate enrichment method). All strains representing various serotypes and
toxin combinations tested showed reactivity with the Curian Shiga Toxin assay, detailed
below:
Stx1 Strains: O26:H11 (6), O111:H8 (3), O45:H2 (3), O103:H25 (2), O145 (2), O103:H11
(2), O157:H7, O103:H2, O111
Stx2 Strains: O121:H19 (4), O145 (3), O104:H21 (2), O113:H21 (2), O157:H7, O157:NM,
O145:H25, O145:H28, O91:H21
Stx1+2 Strains: O111:H8 (3), O157:H7 (2), O111 (2), O145, O113:H21, O26:H11
7. Assay Cut-Off:
To determine the preliminary cut-off the Curian Shiga Toxin assay read on the Curian
Analyzer, a panel of clinical negative and contrived positive (near LoD) broth cultures were
evaluated. The initial cut-off was validated during the prospective clinical study by testing a
population of 1538 specimens, of which 5 were positive for Stx1, 4 were positive for Stx2,
and 1529 were negative by the Curian Shiga Toxin assay. The results of the cut-off study
were acceptable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not Applicable.
2. Matrix Comparison:
An equivalency study was conducted to demonstrate that Gram Negative (GN) broth and
MacConkey (MAC) broth culture enrichment methods provided comparable results. Both broth
culture enrichment methods yielded positive results on the Curian Shiga Toxin assay. Results of
this testing demonstrated equivalence and supports the use of MacConkey broth only in all
analytical studies.
The equivalency of MacConkey broth cultures and Sorbitol MacConkey Agar (SMAC)
enrichment methods was also studied. Both enrichment methods yielded positive results on the
Curian Shiga Toxin assay. Results of this testing demonstrated equivalence and supports the use
of MacConkey broth only in all analytical studies.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Prospectively Collected Specimens Study
The performance of the Curian Shiga Toxin test was assessed with preserved and
unpreserved stool specimens prospectively collected from patients suspected of having an E.
coli infection for whom a diagnostic Shiga Toxin test was ordered. Specimens were collected
from five independent clinical sites. For the reference method, stool specimens were tested
directly using the Vero cell culture method. For the Curian assay, the stool specimens were
inoculated into appropriate broth and tested. The sensitivity and specificity for the Curian
Shiga Toxin test was calculated by comparing to Vero cell culture performed at one central
laboratory. Prospective testing consisted of 1538 stool specimens.
The ages of patients ranged from less than 2 years to over 65 years with 29.1% of the
specimens coming from patients that were <21 years of age. Of the 1538 patients tested,
56.4% were female and 42.8% were male. Table 6 and 7 show a summary of the clinical
performance of the Curian Shiga Toxin for all sites, combined. There was no observable
difference in performance of the Curian Shiga Toxin assay with respect to study site, broth
type, kit lot, or patient gender or age. These results are acceptable.

Archived Specimens Study
Due to low prevalence during the study period, 140 archived stool samples were
retrospectively tested for Stx1 and Stx2 using the Curian Shiga Toxin assay at all five study
sites. Five of the specimens were inconclusive when tested by Vero Cell Culture Assay and
were removed from the study. Therefore, results for 135 archived samples were evaluated.
Of the 135, 70 were negative and 65 were positive for Shiga Toxin. Tables 8 and 9 a
