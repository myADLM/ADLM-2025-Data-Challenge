B Indication(s) for Use:
CRYOcheck Factor VIII Deficient Plasma with VWF is for clinical laboratory use as a deficient
substrate in the quantitative determination of Factor VIII activity in 3.2% citrated human plasma
based on the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assay. It is intended to be used in
identifying factor VIII deficiency and as an aid in the management of hemophilia A in
individuals aged 2 years and older. For in vitro diagnostic use.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Instrument Laboratory (IL) ACL TOP (K160276) and ACL TOP Family 50 Series (K150877)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
CRYOcheck Factor VIII Deficient Plasma with VWF is normal human citrated plasma which
has been immunodepleted of factor VIII and to which an exogenous source of human von
Willebrand Factor (vWF) has been added and buffered with HEPES. Factor VIII has been
assayed at less than 1% of normal activity levels and vWF antigen and activity are >50%. It is
provided frozen to users in small-volume aliquots (25 vials of 1.0 mL, and 25 vials of 1.5 mL).
B Principle of Operation:
CRYOcheck Factor VIII Deficient Plasma with VWF is used in the one-stage APTT clotting
assay for the quantification of factor VIII activity. It is used with a modified APTT assay to
measure factor VIII activity on the ACL TOP Family and ACL TOP Family 50 Series analyzers.
The assay determines the functional activity of Factor VIII by measuring the degree of
prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time in the presence of a contact activator,
thromboplastin, phospholipids and calcium ions. Factor VIII activity is correlated with the
prolongation of the clotting time of the Factor VIII deficient plasma to which diluted patient
sample has been added.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP06-Ed2 using three lots of
CRYOcheck Factor VIII Deficient Plasma with VWF in a modified APTT assay to quantify
FVIII activity of fifteen samples created by combining plasma with a high FVIII
concentration (~260%) with congenital hemophilia A patient plasma (0% FVIII). The results
support a linear range of 0 to 230%.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were conducted based on the CLSI EP07, 3rd Ed guideline. The study
design included a single reagent lot and one representative instrument model ACL TOP 700
CTS. Potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances were spiked into the test
samples (one normal and one abnormal reference control plasma sample) and tested with the
control samples. Screening and dose-response testing were performed and none of the
substances in the following table were found to lead to clinically significant interference.
Rivaroxaban, fondaparinux, dabigatran, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight
heparin, and emicizumab were found to interfere with the quantification of FVIII activity
using CRYOcheck Factor VIII Deficient Plasma with VWF in a modified APTT assay.
Limitations regarding the interference of these substances are warranted for the product
instructions for use.

Sample stability
A sample integrity study was conducted at two external sites to assess the stability of fresh
plasma samples at room temperature, when stored frozen at ≤-70°C and after up to two
freeze-thaw cycles. The FVIII activity of eighty plasma samples was measured using one lot
of CRYOcheck Factor VIII Deficient Plasma with VWF on IL ACL TOP 300 and IL ACL
TOP 700 (K160276) analyzers. Results were compared using weighted Deming regression
analysis and support a fresh sample stability claim of 2 hours at room temperature and a
frozen storage claim of 1.5 months at ≤-70°C, including up to two freeze-thaw cycles.

Shelf-Life Stability
A shelf-life stability study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP25-A using an IL ACL
TOP 700 CTS instrument (K160276). Three lots of CRYOcheck Factor VIII Deficient
Plasma with VWF were stored at -40°C and ≤-70°C and tested at t=0 and regular intervals
defined by the lot-specific pull schedule up to 37 months (real time study is ongoing). At
each timepoint, five replicates of one normal and two abnormal reference controls and two
patient plasma samples representing very low and high levels of FVIII activity levels were
quantified in a modified APTT assay. The study has been completed up to 25 months and
supports a shelf-life stability claim of 24 months when the product is stored at -40°C and
80°C.
In-Use Stability
An in-use stability study was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP25-A using an IL ACL
TOP 700 CTS instrument (K160276). Three lots of CRYOcheck Factor VIII Deficient
Plasma with VWF were maintained on board the analyzer (14.5–15.5°C) for up to 25 hours
and in a refrigerator (2–8°C) for up to 25 hours. Each lot was used in a modified APTT assay
to quantify five replicates of one normal and two abnormal reference controls and two patient
plasma samples representing low and high levels of FVIII activity from each storage
condition at defined timepoints. The data support a stability claim of 24 hours on board the
instrument at 2–8°C.
6. Detection Limit:

7. Recovery of FVIII Replacement Therapies:
A recovery study was conducted using a single lot of CRYOcheck Factor VIII Deficient
Plasma with VWF in a modified APTT assay on an IL ACL TOP 700 CTS instrument
(K160276). Congenital FVIII deficient plasma was spiked with six FVIII replacement
therapies at seven concentrations and percent recovery was determined. CRYOcheck Factor
VIII Deficient Plasma with VWF met the predefined acceptance criteria to evaluate the
potency of FVIII concentrates including Advate, Afstyla, Elocate, Jivi, Novoeight, and
Wilate at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1.0 IU/mL. There was an underestimation of
Afstyla*, and a 2x correction factor were applied to the results based on the manufacturer’s
recommendations.
Product Mean Percent Recovery (%)
Advate 92.84
Afstyla* 97.38
Eloctate 94.90
Jivi 104.49
Novoeight 113.33
Wilate 94.92
*Per the manufacturer’s recommendation, a chromogenic assay is recommended for measurement of Afstyla.
Mean percent recovery value includes 2x correction based on manufacturer’s recommendation that one stage
clotting assay shows an under recovery of 50%.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted at four sites (one internal and three external) to
compare the accuracy of factor VIII activity measurement when using CRYOcheck Factor
VIII Deficient Plasma with VWF in a modified APTT assay to a comparator device. Three
hundred and sixty-six human plasma samples from normal ostensibly healthy individuals,
patients with congenital or acquired hemophilia A, patients with hemophilia B, patients with
von Willebrand disease, patients on recombinant FVIII replacement therapies, and patients
with other factor deficiencies were distributed across four sites and tested to quantify FVIII
activity using a single lot of CRYOcheck Factor VIII Deficient Plasma with VWF on IL
ACL TOP 500, IL ACL TOP 700 CTS (K160276), and IL ACL TOP 750 CTS (K150877)
analyzers. A second aliquot of each sample was tested using a modified APTT assay with
HemosIL Factor VIII Deficient Plasma on an IL ACL TOP 750 instrument (K150877).
Results were compared by Passing-Bablok regression analysis. The method comparison
results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
