III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
The HAVAb IgG II assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) used for
the qualitative detection of IgG antibody to hepatitis A virus (IgG anti-HAV) in human adult and
pediatric (4 throught 21 years) serum (collected in serum and serum separator tubes) and plasma
(collected in sodium heparin, lithium heparin, lithium heparin separator, dipotassium EDTA, and
tripotassium EDTA tubes) from patients with signs and symptoms or at risk for hepatitis A on
the Alinity i system.
The HAVAb IgG II assay is used to determine the immune status of individuals to hepatitis A
virus (HAV) infection.
Warning: This assay has not been cleared for use in screening blood, plasma, or tissue donors.
This assay cannot be used for the diagnosis of acute HAV infection.
Assay performance characteristics have not been established when the HAVAb IgG II assay is
used in conjunction with other hepatitis assays.
B Indication(s) for Use:

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The HAVAb IgG II assay is an automated two-step immunoassay for the qualitative detection of
IgG anti-HAV in human adult and pediatric serum and plasma from patients with signs and
symptoms or at risk for hepatitis A, using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA)
technology.
B Principle of Operation:
The HAVAb IgG II assay is a fully automated chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay
(CMIA). In the first step of the assay, sample, HAV (human) coated paramagnetic
microparticles, and assay diluent are combined and incubated. The IgG anti-HAV present in the
sample binds to the HAV (human) coated microparticles. The mixture is then washed. In the
second step, Anti-human IgG acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture
and incubated. The mixture is then washed again. In the third step of the assay, the Pre-Trigger
and Trigger Solutions are added. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a
relative light unit (RLU). The presence or absence of IgG anti-HAV in the sample is determined

by the Alinity i system, which calculates results by comparing the chemiluminescent RLU in the
reaction to the cutoff RLU determined from an active calibration. Specimens with signal to
cutoff (S/CO) values ≥ 1.00 are considered reactive for IgG anti-HAV, and specimens with S/CO
values < 1.00 are considered nonreactive for IgG anti-HAV.
S/CO Interpretation
< 1.00 Nonreactive
≥ 1.00 Reactive
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Alinity i system
2. Specimen Identification:
A barcode reader reads the barcodes assigned to the specimen
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Sample presence, sample type (calibrator, control, specimen), rack ID/ position number, and
processing completion are tracked by operating software and sample barcode.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Within-laboratory Precision (20 days):
Within- laboratory Precision was evaluated for 20 days on two Alinity i instruments at one
internal site. Two plasma control members- a negative (mean 0.10 S/CO) and positive (mean
2.20 S/CO) HAVAb controls, and two serum member panels- one high negative (mean 0.73
S/CO), and one low positive (mean 1.27 S/CO), were tested. Each sample was tested in
duplicate, in two runs per day, for 20 days, with one control lot, two reagent lots, and two
calibrator lots. Calibration was conducted at the beginning of the study by testing the

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity
Serum from patients with conditions unrelated to HAV infection, antibodies against
microorganisms, and an HAV non-reactive specimen spiked with HAV IgM were tested for
cross-reactivity. Each sample was tested with the candidate device on one Alinity i system
and with comparator device ARCHITECT HAVAB-G, using one of each reagent, calibrator
and control lots. A total of 241/251 samples tested negative on both candidate and
comparator devices. Cross-reactivity was seen in samples that were reactive by the candidate
device and non-reactive by the comparator in: 1/15 Anti-CMV, 1/4 Anti-E. coli, 2/24 Anti-
HBV, 2/20 Anti-T. gondii, 1/2 hemodialysis patients, 2/14 hyper IgG, and 1/32 multiparous

Endogenous Interference:
The impact of endogenous interfering substances found in blood was tested in high negative
(0.80 S/CO) and low positive (1.2 S/CO) contrived samples prepared by spiking high IgG
anti-HAV positive human serum samples into a pool of normal human serum units. Each of
these samples was divided in two aliquots, one aliquot was not supplemented with the
potential interferents, and a second aliquot was supplemented with the following potential
interferents: unconjugated bilirubin (40 mg/dL), conjugated bilirubin (40 mg/dL), biotin (up
to 4300 ng/mL), hemoglobin (1000 mg/dL), total protein (15 g/dL), or triglycerides (1500
mg/dL). The samples were tested with a minimum of 12 replicates using one lot each of
reagents, calibrator, and controls on one instrument. Interference of <10% for 1.20 S/CO
samples or <0.10 S/CO for 0.8 S/CO samples was observed at the following concentrations

5. Stability (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Controls stability:
Real-time stability studies conducted to date support storage of opened and unopened
controls at 2 to 8°C for up to 4 months and In-Use Opened at 2 to 8°C for 3 hours.
Calibrator stability:
Calibrator stability studies conducted to date support storage of opened and unopened
calibrator at 2 to 8°C up to 4 months.
Reagent stability:
Real-time stability studies conducted to date support storage of opened and unopened reagent
kits at 2 to 8°C for up to 4 months and onboard the Alinity i system up to 30 days.
Specimen stability:
Specimen stability studies conducted to date support stability of specimens stored at room
temperature (15 to 25ºC) up to 16 hours, at 2 to 8°C up to 8 days, and at -20ºC up to 30 days.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined with four normal human serum samples tested in 5
replicates, and the Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined with 4 low-level analyte
samples (2, 4, 6, 8 mIU/mL) in duplicates and tested in 10 replicates. All samples were
tested on two different Alinity i instruments, using two reagent lots, and one lot of each
control and calibrator. The LoB was determined to be 0.35 S/CO and the LoD to be 0.40
S/CO.
7. Analytical Sensitivity at the Cut-Off:
The analytical sensitivity of the candidate device at the assay cutoff value of 1.00 S/CO was
conducted to determine the relationship between S/CO and the units of the WHO
International Standard (WHO IS) for anti-hepatitis A, Immunoglobulin, Human (NIBSC
Code: 97/646). The study was performed by diluting the WHO IS with anti-HAV negative
recalcified plasma to a concentration of 50 mIU/mL (Intermediate). Recalcified plasma is the
same matrix as the calibrator/control material that is tested to be negative for anti-HAV
antibodies, which is similar to serum. A panel of five different dilutions was prepared by
combining the Intermediate with anti-HAV negative recalcified plasma to a concentration of
10, 12.5, 14.5, 17.5, and 20 mIU/mL. Each dilution was tested in 9 replicates per lot, with 3
reagent lots, on one Alinity i instrument. The calibrators and controls were also tested. For
each reagent lot, the least squares linear regression analysis was performed on the mean
S/CO for each dilution (mean of 9 replicates each) vs. the target concentration across the
dilutions. The analytical sensitivity at 1.0 S/CO was determined to be 15.7 mIU/mL.

S/CO) was evaluated. A wash buffer sample was tested in three replicates to clear the system.
One replicate of the high negative sample was tested to serve as a sample that was not
exposed to potential sample carryover (protected negative sample). This was followed by one
replicate of the high positive sample that was used to introduce potential carryover effects.
Then, one other replicate of the negative sample was tested to serve as a sample exposed to
potential sample carryover (unprotected negative sample). This carryover event series was
tested 12 times across 5 runs. The mean S/CO value, standard deviation, difference and
percent difference of the means between the protected and unprotected samples was
evaluated as shown below.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A prospective multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the performance of HAVAb IgG
II assay evaluated on three Alinity i instruments at three clinical centers in the United States.
Samples were tested using three lots of HAVAb IgG II reagent, two lots of HAVAb IgG II
calibrator, and two lots of HAVAb IgG II controls. A total of 944 native human serum
specimens were tested, consisting of individuals at increased risk of HAV infection,
individuals with signs and symptoms of hepatitis infection, HAV vaccine recipients, and
pediatric population. Specimens <1.00 S/CO were considered non-reactive, and specimens ≥
1.0 S/CO were considered reactive. Percent agreement with the results obtained with the
ARCHITECT HAVAB-G assay is summarized in the following sections.

2. Matrix Comparison/Tube Type Equivalency
The aim of the matrix equivalency study was to verify the appropriate specimen tube type for
use with the HAVAb IgG II assay for serum, serum separator, and plasma (sodium heparin,
lithium heparin, lithium heparin separator, dipotassium EDTA, and tripotassium EDTA)
samples. A total of 22 sets of matched serum, serum separator, dipotassium EDTA, lithium
heparin, sodium heparin, lithium heparin separator, and tripotassium EDTA were used in this
study. The study included a total of 22 negative and 20 positive samples. Serum negative
donor specimens were spiked with a high positive specimen (at a volume ≤ 5%) to contrive
high negative (0.65 to 0.86 S/CO) and low positive (1.2 to 1.5 S/CO) samples. Each sample
set was tested in at least 2 replicates, with one reagent, calibrator and control lot, on one
instrument. Agreement of performance between the serum control and the evaluated tube
type was calculated and supports the use of this assay with the following tube types:
dipotassium EDTA, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, lithium heparin separator, serum
separator, and tripotassium EDTA.
