VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability and Within-Laboratory Precision study
Repeatability (within-run precision) and intermediate precision (within-laboratory precision)
studies were conducted according to the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline. For lithium heparin
plasma samples, the study was run on five DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers, using
three reagent lots and five calibrator lots. Eight lithium heparin plasma samples consisting of
an individual native lithium heparin plasma sample, pooled native lithium heparin plasma
samples, and native lithium heparin samples spiked with purified human cardiac troponin I
antigen, with varying concentrations spanning the assay range were each tested in duplicate,
in two runs per day, over 20 days for a total of 40 runs and a minimum of 80 replicates.
For serum samples, the study was run on three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers,
using three reagent lots and three calibrator lots. Five serum samples with TnI concentrations
spanning the range of the assay (Samples 2, 3, 4 = pool of native serum samples and Samples
5 and 6 = native serum sample spiked with purified human cardiac troponin I antigen) were
each tested in duplicate, in two runs per day over 20 days on each instrument and reagent lot
combination.
The within-laboratory (total) imprecision includes within-run (repeatability), between-run,
and between-day variance components. Results for this study for one representative reagent
lot are shown below:

Reproducibility was evaluated on three instruments at three external clinical laboratories
following recommendations described in CLSI EP05-A3. Five serum and six lithium heparin
samples with hsTnI concentrations covering the measuring range were analyzed on
instruments in replicates of three over a five-day period with two runs per day, three reagent
lots per run, generating a maximum of 90 measurements per sample per platform per site;
270 total measurements per instrument. One calibrator lot was used in the studies. The
results are summarized below.

Thermal imprecision study:
The study was run on two instruments, using three reagent lots and two calibrator lots. Seven
lithium heparin plasma samples, with varying hsTnI concentrations, were assayed in
duplicate with two runs per day, over 30 days under the following temperature conditions:
Calibrating at 18°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
Calibrating at 23°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
Calibrating at 28°C and running samples at 18°C, 23°C and 28°C
Samples were tested at each temperature for a period of 10 days for a total of 40 replicates
for each temperature condition. Imprecision was evaluated for all combinations of calibration
and result temperature for each sample on each of two instruments.
The within-laboratory (total) imprecision includes within-run (repeatability), between-run,
and between-day variance components. The following results from one set of temperature
conditions are representative of the results from this precision study:

2. Linearity:
Two studies were performed to determine the linearity of the modified device following the
recommendations in CLSI EP06-A2. One study evaluated the full range and the second
study evaluated the low range of the assay. The low sample was a native sample containing a
concentration of hsTnI at the low end of the measuring interval and the high sample was
prepared using purified human cardiac troponin. Using these low and high samples,
admixtures were prepared by using incrementally larger proportions of the high sample

diluted with the low sample, in order to achieve concentrations that span the range of the
assay or span the low range of the assay. These studies were run on one instrument using
three reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot.
The data was analyzed based on CLSI EP06-A2 using a weighted linear regression
comparing the observed results to the expected results based on the proportion of high
sample in the linearity panel level. The deviation from linearity was derived for each sample
by calculating the difference between the observed result and the corresponding value from
the linear fit. The maximum deviation from linearity for these studies was 10% for study one
(full range study) and 8% for study two (low range study). Representative results for
weighted linear regression are shown below:
Study One: Full AMR
Sample Type Range Tested (pg/mL) Regression Equation
Lithium Heparin Plasma 1.660 – 31,522 y=0.9533x+0.0768
Serum 0.982 – 30,419 y=1.006x-0.006
Study Two: Low End of AMR

Lithium Heparin Plasma 1.645 – 122 y=0.9919x-0.0048
Serum 1.249 – 100 y=0.9283x+0.0858
These studies support the sponsor’s measuring range claim of 2.0 to 27,027 pg/mL which is
the same as the predicate.
Hook Effect:
Same as described in K172787.
Dilution:
A dilution study was performed and supports a 1:10 auto-dilution claim which is the same as
the predicate.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference:
The sponsor conducted studies to support that the interference claims of the candidate device
are unchanged from K172787.
Cross-Reactivity:
The sponsor conducted studies to support that the cross-reactivity claims of the candidate
device are unchanged from K172787.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability and stability are the same as described in K172787, except for the stability of
frozen samples which has been updated to support the storage of frozen samples at -20°C for
up to 180 days.
6. Detection Limit:
Studies were performed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection
(LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the Access hsTnI assay on the DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer using the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.
For the estimation of LoB, three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzers were used in the study
design with three reagent lots and one calibrator lot. Four S0 calibrators were used for the
LoB determination. Samples were tested over three days with one run per day and five
replicates per run, for each pack lot.
For estimation of LoD, three DxI 9000 Immunoassay System were used in the study with
three reagent lots and one calibrator lot. Eight serum and nine lithium heparin plasma
samples containing low levels of hsTnI analyte were measured. Samples were tested over
five days with one run per day, nine replicates per run, for each pack lot. The maximum
observed LoD across the lots was taken as the reported value for the measurement procedure.
For estimation of LoQ, 12-13 serum and lithium heparin (plasma) samples containing low
levels of hsTnI analyte were measured. Samples were tested in replicates of nine per run with
one run per day and five total days on each pack lot and instrument. This resulted in a
maximum of 45 replicates for each sample on each pack lot tested. A variance components
model was used to estimate the within-run and within-laboratory (total) %CV for each
sample on each instrument and reagent lot combination.
A second study was performed to evaluate LoQ of the Access hsTnI assay across various
calibration and run temperatures. Multiple LoQ studies were completed across two DxI 9000
instruments, two reagent lots, and three ambient temperatures. A panel of native serum
samples containing low concentrations of troponin I analyte were measured in replicates of 5
per run with 2 runs per day over 5 days. This study was repeated at each of three ambient run
and calibration temperatures (18 °C, 25 °C, and 32 °C). This same study design was
completed for each instrument and reagent lot combination. A variance components model
was used to estimate the within-laboratory (total) %CV for each sample on each instrument
and reagent lot combination at each calibration and run temperature combination.
The results of the studies support the unchanged claimed measuring range of 2.0-27,027
pg/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The sponsor performed method comparison studies to demonstrate equivalence between the
unmodified assay (K172787) and the candidate assay.
A method comparison study was conducted by comparing the results for the Access hsTnI
assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer to the predicate device, the Access
hsTnI assay on the Access 2 Immunoassay Analyzer. Lithium heparin and serum samples
from the intended use population were evaluated using the predicate device and the candidate
device across three reagent pack lots at multiple sites. Trilevel quality controls were also
evaluated daily in duplicates to verify systems were in specifications. Results of this method
comparison study were analyzed using both Passing-Bablok and Weighted Deming
regression models. Representative results (based on Passing Bablok) are summarized below:
Method Comparison: Access hsTnI (DxI 9000 vs. Access 2)
