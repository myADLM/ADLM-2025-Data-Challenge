C Type of Test:
Qualitative lateral flow immunochromatographic assay
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Xenta Drug Screen Cup and Xenta Drug Screen Dipcard are lateral flow chromatographic
immunoassays designed to qualitatively detect the presence of drugs and drug metabolites in
human urine at the following cut-off concentrations:
Test Calibrator Cut-off level
Marijuana (THC) Delta-9-THC-COOH 50 ng/mL
Cocaine (COC) Benzoylecgonine 300 ng/mL
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine 500 ng/mL
Methamphetamine (MET) D-Methamphetamine 1000 ng/mL
Morphine 300 (MOP) Morphine 300 ng/mL
The tests contain two formats:1) Test Cup and 2) Test Dipcard. The tests may be configured as
single drug tests or multiple drug tests in any combination of the drug analytes listed in the table
above. These tests are intended for in vitro diagnostics use. They are intended for prescription
use.
The assays provide only a preliminary analytical test result. Gas Chromatography/Mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
preliminary positive results are indicated.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable; this is a visually read single use device

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Xenta Drug Screen Cup and Xenta Drug Screen Dipcard are competitive binding, lateral flow
immunochromatographic assays.
Kit Contents for Xenta Drug Screen Cup:
• One Xenta Drug Screen Cup with integrated test card.
• Desiccant Pouch.
Kit Contents for Xenta Drug Screen Dipcard:
• One pouch containing a test panel and desiccant.
• Urine Cups
The Xenta Drug Screen Cup and Xenta Drug Screen Dipcard formats use identical test strips
made with the same chemical formulation and manufacturing procedures.
B Principle of Operation:
The candidate device is a competitive immunoassay. It is a chromatographic absorbent device in
which drugs within a urine sample competitively bind to a limited number of drug monoclonal
antibody (mouse) conjugate binding sites.
When the test is activated, the urine is absorbed into each test strip by capillary action, mixes
with the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate, and flows across a pre-coated
membrane. When drug within the urine sample is at a level below the detection level of the test,
the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate binds to the respective drug-protein
conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the test strip. This produces a colored test line
in the Test Region (T) of the strip, that, regardless of its intensity, indicates a negative test result.
When sample drug levels are at or above the detection level of the test, the free drug in the
sample binds to the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate, preventing the respective
drug monoclonal antibody conjugate from binding to the respective drug-protein conjugate
immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This prevents the development of a distinct
colored band in the test region, indicating a preliminary positive result.
To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C) of each strip
(if the test has been performed properly).

Precision studies were performed for the Xenta Drug Screen Dipcard and Xenta Drug Screen
Cup formats. Drug free specimens were spiked with analytes at 0, ±75% cutoff, ±50% cutoff,
±25% cutoff, the cutoff, and +100% cutoff of each drug. The concentrations of the target
drugs were confirmed with GC/MS. Each urine specimen was divided into aliquots. Testing
was performed by an operator blinded to the sample concentration. Separate sets of blind-
coded samples were assigned and randomized prior to testing. The study was conducted by 6
operators at 3 Point-of-Care sites. Two operators per location tested 3 aliquots at each
concentration for each lot per day (3 runs/day) for 10 non-consecutive days using one device
lot per location. One operator tested the Xenta Drug Screen Dipcard format and the second
operator tested the Xenta Drug Screen Cup format. Precision studies were performed using
the single drug and multi-drug test formats and results were similar. Only the results from
the multi-drug test format for both the screen cup and screen dipcard are provided in the
tables below:

Cross-Reactivity
To determine cross-reactivity, drug metabolites and structurally similar compounds were
tested. All the components were added to drug-free normal human urine. Each sample was
tested in 5 replicates using two lots of Xenta Drug Screen Dipcard and one lot of Xenta Drug
Screen Cup. If any positive result was observed, the compounds were further diluted with
known drug-free urine specimen sequentially to different concentrations and tested in
quintuplicate, until the highest concentration that generated a negative result was reached.
The cross-reacting substances with the lowest concentration that produced a positive result
was identified and is listed in the table below. If no cross-reactivity was observed the highest
concentration tested is shown.

Interfering substances
To determine interference, potentially interfering compounds (listed below) were added to
drug-free urine or drug positive urine containing MDMA, THC, COC, MET, and MOP
concentrations 50% below the cutoff and 50% above the cutoff, respectively. All potential
interfering substances were added at a concentration of 100µg/mL. All concentrations of the
drugs were confirmed with GC/MS. The urine specimens were tested in 3 replicates with two
lots of the rapid single/multi-drug Xenta Drug Screen Dipcard and one lot of the rapid
single/multi-drug Xenta Drug Screen Cup. None of the urine samples showed any deviation
from the expected results.

Effect of Urinary Specific Gravity
The specific gravity studies were conducted on drug-free urine specimens with varying specific
gravity conditions including 1.002, 1.010, 1.020, 1.030, 1.040 spiked with MDMA, THC,
COC, MET, or MOP at 50% below and 50% above cutoff levels. All concentrations were
confirmed with GC/MS. Each sample was tested using two lots of the corresponding multi-
drug Xenta Drug Screen Cup and Xenta Drug Screen Dipcard. The results demonstrate that
the tested range of specific gravity does not affect the test result.
Effect of Urinary pH
The pH of an aliquot of negative urine pool was adjusted to a pH range of 3 to 9 in 1 pH
unit increments and spiked with each drug at 50% below and 50% above cutoff levels (all
concentrations were confirmed with GC/MS). Each sample was tested using two lots of the
corresponding multi-drug Xenta Drug Screen Cup and Xenta Drug Screen Dipcard. The
result demonstrate that the tested pH range does not interfere with the performance of the
test.

Eighty (80) clinical urine specimens for each drug were analyzed by GC/MS and by two lots
of the corresponding Xenta Drug Screen Cup and Xenta Drug Screen Dipcard. The study
was conducted by 4 operators at two Point-of-Care sites in which the Xenta Drug Screen Cup
or Xenta Drug Screen Dipcard format was tested. Comparison studies were performed using
the single drug and multi-drug test formats and results were similar. Only the results from
the multi-drug test format for both the Xenta Drug Screen cup and Xenta Drug Screen
Dipcard are provided in the tables below:
