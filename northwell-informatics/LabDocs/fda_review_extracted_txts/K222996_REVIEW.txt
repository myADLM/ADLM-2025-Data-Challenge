B Principle of Operation:
The DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzer uses enzyme immunoassays (utilizing paramagnetic
particle solid phase and chemiluminescent detection) for the quantitative, semi-quantitative or
qualitative determination of various analyte concentrations found in serum and plasma samples.
The Access PCT assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay.
Monoclonal anti-PCT antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase is added to a reaction vessel
along with a surfactant-containing buffer and sample.
After a short incubation, paramagnetic particles coated with monoclonal anti-PCT antibody are
added. The PCT binds to the anti-PCT antibody on the solid phase, while the anti-PCT antibody-
alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts with different antigenic sites on the PCT molecules.
After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light
generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly
proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A within-laboratory precision study was performed based on CLSI EP05- A3
recommendations. Seven native serum samples spiked with varying concentrations of PCT
antigen were tested in duplicate with two runs per day (≥ 20 days), three reagent lots, and
three calibrator lots across three different instrument systems (for a total of 80 replicates per
sample for each instrument and reagent lot combination). Total imprecision, within run
imprecision, between run, and between day variation was evaluated in terms of percent
coefficient of variation, %CV.
The acceptance criteria for within-laboratory imprecision were established as a standard
deviation (SD) ≤ 0.012 for values < 0.150 ng/mL and a CV ≤ 8.0% for values ≥ 0.150
ng/mL. Acceptance criteria for within-run imprecision (Repeatability) was established as a
SD ≤ 0.009 ng/mL for values < 0.150 ng/mL & CV ≤ 6% for values ≥ 0.150 ng/mL.
The total within-laboratory imprecision included %CVs between 2.2% and 6.1% for PCT
concentrations ≥ 0.150 ng/mL and SDs between 0.006 – 0.008 for PCT concentrations <
0.150 ng/mL.
The within-run imprecision included % CVs between 1.9% and 4.7% for PCT concentrations
≥ 0.150 ng/mL and SDs between 0.004 – 0.007 for PCT concentrations < 0.150 ng/mL.
Results from the within-laboratory precision study are presented below in Tables 1 to 3.

The study demonstrated that the Access PCT assay met acceptance criteria for total
imprecision on the DxI 9000 with an SD ≤ 0.012 ng/mL for values < 0.150 ng/mL and a CV
≤ 8.0% for values ≥ 0.150 ng/mL. The Access PCT assay also met the within run imprecision
(repeatability) acceptance criteria with an SD ≤ 0.009 ng/mL for values < 0.150 ng/mL and
CV ≤ 6.0% for values ≥ 0.150 ng/mL.
2. Linearity:
Two studies were performed to determine the linearity of the Access PCT assay on the DxI
9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer based on CLSI EP06-Ed2. In both studies one DxI 9000
Immunoassay Analyzer, three reagent lots, and one calibrator lot were used. Three quality
controls were run in replicates of two on each day to verify the system was in control.
In the first study, serum samples covering the full range of the assay were used for the
linearity determination. A native sample containing a concentration of PCT at the low end of
the measuring interval was obtained. The high sample was prepared by spiking PCT antigen
into a low serum sample until a concentration above the Access PCT S6 calibrator was
achieved. In addition to the high and low PCT concentration samples, seven mixtures were
assessed. These samples were prepared independently by using incrementally larger
proportions of the high sample diluted with the low sample, to achieve procalcitonin
concentrations that covered the range of the assay. The low sample was run in replicates of
eight, and all other samples were run in replicates of four. Assay results were analyzed by a
weighted linear regression and the analysis of linearity is summarized in Table 4 below.
Acceptance criteria were established as a detectable non-linearity within ± 0.012 ng/mL for
values ≤ 0.150 ng/mL and ± 10% for values > 0.150 ng/mL. The statistical analysis of data
showed that the results met the acceptance criteria.

In the second study, serum samples covering the low range of the assay were prepared and
used for linearity determination. A native sample containing a concentration of PCT at the
low end of the measuring interval was obtained. The high sample was prepared at
concentration near 3 ng/mL by spiking PCT antigen into a low serum sample until a
concentration of about 3 ng/mL was achieved. In addition to the high and low PCT
concentration samples, seven mixtures were evaluated in this study. These samples were
prepared independently by using incrementally larger proportions of the high sample diluted
with the low sample, to achieve concentrations that covered the low range of the assay. The
low sample was run in replicates of eight, and all the other samples were run in replicates of
four. The assay results were analyzed by weighted linear regression and the analysis of
linearity is summarized in Table 5 below. Acceptance criteria were established as a
detectable non-linearity within ± 0.012 ng/mL for values ≤ 0.150 ng/mL and ± 10% for
values > 0.150 ng/mL. The statistical analysis of data showed that the results met the
acceptance criteria.

calibrator set intended to calibrate the Access PCT assay for the quantitative determination of
procalcitonin levels in human serum and plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems.
The zero calibrators (S0) contain lyophilized HEPES buffer with protein (bovine), ≤ 0.1 %
sodium azide, and 0.1% ProClin300. Four S0 calibrators were used for the LoB
determination. Samples were evaluated over three days including one run per day and five
replicates per run for each pack lot. Three quality control samples were also run in replicates
of two on each day.
LoB estimates were calculated for each combination of reagent lot and instrument based on a
non-parametric approach and the maximum observed LoB was taken as the
reported value for the measurement procedure. LoB was determined using the 95%
nonparametric percentile of the replicates for each of three reagent lots.
The LoB estimate of the PCT assay was 0.002 ng/mL and met the acceptance criteria of ≤
0.005 ng/mL.
LoD
For estimation of LoD, three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Systems were used in the study with
three reagent lots and one calibrator lot. Nine serum samples containing low levels of PCT
analyte were prepared. Samples were evaluated over five days including one run per day and nine
replicates per run for each reagent lot. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on
each day.
The LoD was determined by fitting the precision profile model between within-lab standard
deviation (SD) and concentration. The SD was multiplied by the 95th percentile of the standard
normal distribution and added to the LoB to calculate the LoD per CLSI EP17-A2. The
maximum observed LoD is taken as the reported value for the measurement procedure.
The LoD estimate of the PCT assay was 0.003 ng/mL which met the acceptance criteria of ≤ 0.01
ng/mL.
LoQ
Studies were performed to determine the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
of the Access PCT assay on the DxI 9000 Immunoassay System based on recommendations
in CLSI EP17- A2 (Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement
Procedures; Approved Guideline – Second Edition). Three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Systems
were used in the study design with three reagent lots and one calibrator lot.
For estimation of LoQ, thirteen native serum samples containing low levels of PCT analyte
were measured. Samples were evaluated across five days in replicates of nine per run with
one run per day. A minimum of 40 replicates for each sample on each reagent lot were
evaluated. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day.
A variance components model was used to estimate the within run and
within-laboratory (total) %CV for each sample on each instrument and reagent lot
combination. A log-log quadratic precision model was fitted to within-laboratory (total)
%CV versus observed sample mean. The fitted precision profile was used to calculate the
K222996 - Page 10 of 14

--- Page 11 ---
20% CV LoQ. The maximum observed LoQ was taken as the reported value for the
measurement procedure. The acceptance criterion was 20% Within- Laboratory CV LoQ at ≤
0.02 ng/mL.
The 20% CV LoQ estimate for the Access PCT assay was 0.002 ng/mL which met the
acceptance criteria of less than or equal to 0.02 ng/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
See the Method Comparison section below for bias estimation at medically relevant
concentrations.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was completed to compare the performance of the Access PCT
assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer to the Access PCT assay on the
Access 2 Immunoassay System using a protocol based on CLSI EP09c-A3, Method
Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples: Approved Guideline –
Third Edition.
A total of one hundred and twenty native serum samples were evaluated in the method
comparison study. The study was run on three DxI 9000 instruments and three Access 2
instruments and utilized a total of three reagent pack lots and three calibrator lots. Three
commercial quality controls were run in duplicate each day.
The comparison between paired measurements was analyzed by fitting the observations from
the Access PCT Assay on the DxI 9000 instrument into a linear regression model versus the
observations from the Access PCT Assay on Access 2 using the Passing-Bablok method. The
acceptance criteria were R2 ≥ 0.95 with a slope of 1.00 ± 0.10 and encompassed within the
95% confidence interval when compared to the Access PCT Assay on Access 2 Instrument.
Results of the regression analysis are described in Table 6 below.

To evaluate if the reference ranges for the Access PCT assay established on the Access 2 are
maintained on the DxI 9000 instrument, bias was estimated at the concentrations corresponding
to the 95% Upper Reference Interval within a population of healthy male and female subjects as
determined on the predicate Access 2 system. The Passing-Bablok regression was used to derive
