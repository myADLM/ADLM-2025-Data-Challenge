Material needed but not supplied with the reagent kit include the Access Cortisol Calibrators,
Quality Control (QC) materials, Lumi-Phos PRO, and UniCel DxI Wash Buffer II.
Materials required but not provided for the urine extraction procedure include Ethyl acetate
(HPLC grade), 12 mm x 75 mm glass tubes, vortex mixer, pipettes capable of accurately
delivering 200 and 1,000 μL, a centrifuge, and drying apparatus (either nitrogen or air).
B Principle of Operation:
The Access Cortisol assay is a competitive binding immunoenzymatic assay. A sample is added
to a reaction vessel with rabbit antibody to cortisol, cortisol-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and
paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-rabbit capture antibody. Cortisol in the sample
competes with the cortisol-alkaline phosphatase conjugate for binding sites on a limited amount
of specific anti-cortisol antibody. The resulting antigen:antibody complexes bind to the capture
antibody on the solid phase.
After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel which
reacts with the enzyme label in the bound immune complexes, resulting in the emission of light
(chemiluminescence). Light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light
production is inversely proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte
concentration is automatically determined from a stored calibration.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted according to CLSI EP06-2nd edition. A total of 9 levels of
serum samples ranging from 0.104 to 69.295 µg/dL were prepared by mixing different
proportions of a serum sample containing a high concentration of cortisol with a serum
sample containing a low concentration of cortisol. The lowest sample was run in 8 replicates,
and all other samples were run in 4 replicates. Samples were tested on one DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer using 3 reagent lots and one calibrator lot in one day. The data was
analyzed using a weighted linear regression model. The deviation from linearity did not
exceed 0.02 µg/dL for concentrations <5 µg/dL or 8.6% for concentrations >5 µg/dL. The
results support the claimed measuring interval of 0.8 - 60 µg/dL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference was reviewed in K050202.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
See Linearity section VII A.2 above.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The measurand (cortisol) in the Access Cortisol Calibrators is traceable to USP reference
material. The method for value assignment is based on EN ISO 17511.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
validated based on the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
To calculate the LoB, three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzers were used with three
reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot. Four S0 calibrator lots were used as blank samples
for the LoB determination, over three days with one run per day, five replicates per run for
each pack lot. LoB was determined using the 95% nonparametric percentile of the replicates
for each of three reagent lots. The LoB was determined to be 0.2 µg/dL and the claimed LoB
is 0.4 µg/dL.
To calculate the LoD, three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzers were used with three reagent
lots and one calibrator lot. Nine native serum samples containing low levels of cortisol were
tested over five days with one run per day and nine replicates per run for each pack lot. The
LoD was determined to be 0.3 µg/dL and the claimed LoD is 0.4µg/dL.
Limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined using 13 serum samples containing low levels of
cortisol. Samples were tested on three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzers, using three reagent
pack lots and one calibrator lot. Each of the samples were run in replicates of nine on three
reagent pack lots with one run per day for five days on each pack lot. The LoQ (<20%
within-laboratory CV) was determined to be 0.4 µg/dL and the claimed LoQ is 0.8 µg/dL.
These studies support the claimed measuring range of 0.8-60 µg/dL.

Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted comparing the Access Cortisol assay on the DxI
9000 Analyzer to the comparator device, the Access Cortisol assay on the Access 2
Immunoassay System using a protocol based on CLSI EP09c-A3. A total of 116 serum
