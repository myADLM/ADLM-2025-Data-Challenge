B Principle of Operation:
Both the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent and Aptiva APS IgM Reagent utilize particle based multi-
analyte technology (PMAT) in a cartridge format. Both the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent and the
Page 3 of 20

--- Page 4 ---
Aptiva APS IgM Reagent contain two different populations of particles: one particle population
coated with cardiolipin along with human purified β2GPI and another particle population coated
with only human purified β2GPI antigen. The two analyte microparticles, along with the control
microparticle, are stored in the reagent cartridge.
The Aptiva System dilutes the sample 1:8, then combines an aliquot of diluted sample, and
reagent into a cuvette. After incubation at 37°C and followed with a wash cycle, conjugated anti-
human IgG or IgM antibodies are added to the particles. Following the incubation of this mixture
at 37°C, excess conjugate is removed in another wash cycle, and the particles are re-suspended in
system fluid. Multiple images are generated by the system to identify and count the two unique
analyte particles, as well as determine the amount of conjugate on each particle. A third particle,
coated with goat anti-human IgG or IgM antibodies, is present in the reagent as a control to flag
low concentrations of IgG or IgM in the sample as an assay verification step. The median
fluorescent intensity (MFI) for each analyte is proportional to the concentration of conjugate
bound to human IgG or IgM, which is proportional to the concentration of IgG or IgM antibodies
bound to the corresponding particle population. The system uses the MFI from at least 50
particles of each population. The identity of the particles is determined by the unique signature of
the particles.
Each analyte in the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent and the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent is assigned a
predefined lot specific master curve. The analyte specific master curve is stored on the reagent
cartridge radio frequency identification (RFID) label. Based on results obtained by running
calibrators (supplied separately), the system creates individual working curves. Working curves
are used by the software to calculate Fluorescent Light Units (FLU) for each analyte from the
MFI values obtained for each sample.

Lot-to-Lot Imprecision:
The lot-to-lot imprecision of the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent and Aptiva APS IgM Reagent was
evaluated by testing seven serum samples for aCL IgG and aβ2GPI IgG with three lots of the
Aptiva APS IgG Reagent and six serum samples for aCL IgM and aβ2GPI IgM with three
lots of the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent. Samples were tested in replicates of five, once a day,
for five days using one instrument to generate a total of 75 data points for each sample. The
results are summarized in the tables below.

IgG Reagent and the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent according to CLSI EP06-Ed2.
For the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent, five overlapping dilution series to cover the AMI of each of
the aCL IgG and aβ2GPI IgG assays were prepared by mixing human serum samples with
high antibody concentrations and samples with low antibody concentrations. Each sample
was tested in duplicate using one lot of the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent. The overall testing
range for linearity study is from 0.11–382.20 FLU for aCL IgG assay, and 0.11–301.21 FLU
for a aβ2GPI IgG. The percent deviation from the weighted least squares regression analysis
was used to assess the fit of the regression for each sample and each analyte. The data
support the linearity of AMI of 0.29–328.94 FLU for the aCL IgG assay and the AMI of
0.21–256.70 FLU for the aβ2GPI IgG assay, as part of the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent.
For Aptiva APS IgM Reagent, four overlapping dilution series to cover portions of the AMI
of each of the aCL IgM and aβ2GPI IgM assays were prepared by mixing human serum
samples with high antibody concentrations and samples with low antibody concentrations.
Each sample was tested in duplicate using one lot of the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent. The
overall testing range for linearity study is from 0.04–118.12 FLU for aCL IgM assay, and
0.04–102.10 FLU for a aβ2GPI IgM. The percent deviation from the weighted least squares
regression analysis was used to assess the fit of the regression for each sample and each
analyte. The data support the linearity of AMI of 0.10–114.68 FLU for the aCL IgM assay
and the AMI of 0.10–95.86 FLU for the aβ2GPI IgM assay, as part of the Aptiva APS IgM
Reagent.
3. Hook effect
The hook effect for Aptiva APS IgG Reagent and Aptiva APS IgM Reagent on the Aptiva
System was evaluated by testing high positive serum samples for each device: two high aCL
IgG samples and two high aβ2GPI IgG samples for the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent; two high
aCL IgM samples and two high aβ2GPI IgM samples for the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent.
For the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent, no antigen excess hook effect was observed up to 2645.36
FLU for aCL IgG and 1790.48 FLU for aβ2GPI IgG.
For the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent, no hook effect was observed up to 167.25 FLU for aCL
IgM and 126.13 FLU for the aβ2GPI IgM.
4. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference
An interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 for the Aptiva APS IgG
Reagent and the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent. A set of three human serum specimens— one
positive, one around the cut-off and one negative sample for each assay were used to prepare
interferent spiked samples or corresponding control samples without the interfering

Traceability:
There is no international reference material for anti-cardiolipin antibodies and anti-β2-GPI
antibodies. Calibrator and control values are directly traceable to in-house reference materials
that are used to create the master curves for each assay of the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent and
the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent.
Stability:
a. Reagent shelf-life stability: An on-going real-time stability and an accelerated stability
study were conducted to establish shelf-life stability for the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent and
the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent. The study required testing at least three serum samples at
different levels for each assay using three lots of reagents at different timepoints. The
collected data showed the initial shelf-life of 9 months for the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent
and 7 months for the Aptiva IgM Reagent when stored at 2–8℃.
b. Reagent in-use (on-board) stability: An initial in-use stability for the Aptiva APS IgG
Reagent and Aptiva APS IgM Reagent was conducted by testing multiple samples with
different assay levels at different time points using the reagent stored on board. The in-
use (on-board) stability of the Aptiva APS IgG and Aptiva APS IgM Reagents was set at
28 days, with a 14-day recalibration.
c. Reagent shipping stability: A transport simulation study was performed to assess the
shipping stability of the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent and the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent kits
during transport. The study was performed under simulated conditions that the products
may potentially be exposed to during transport. The collected data support the reagent
packaging mitigates the potential impact of temperature stressing during transport.
d. Sample stability: Five serum samples with different antibody levels were stored at
various storage temperatures and tested with the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent and the Aptiva
APS IgM Reagent at various timepoints. The collected data showed that the sample can
be stored up to 14 days at 2–8°C, up to 48 hours at room temperature (20–26°C), and up
to five freeze/thaw cycles when stored at -20°C.
7. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
assessed for each analyte in the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent and the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent
following CLSI EP17-A2.
LoB:
To determine the LoB, four blank samples were run in five replicates, once a day for three
days using two reagent lots, for a total of 60 data points per lot. The LoB was determined for
each assay, on each reagent lot separately, at the 95th percentile using the non-parametric
method for all analyses. The higher LoB result between the two lots was selected for the final
LoB value.
Page 14 of 20

--- Page 15 ---
LoD:
To determine the LoD for each analyte, four low level samples were assayed in five
replicates, twice per day for three days using two reagent lots, to generate a total of 120 data
points for each assay on each reagent lot. The LoD was calculated as the LoB + 1.65 x SD of
the replicates for the samples separately for each assay on each reagent lot and the highest
LoD result was selected for the final LoD value.
LoQ:
To determine the LoQ for each analyte, four low level samples (different from LoD study)
were run in five replicates, twice per day for three days using two reagent lots, to generate
120 data points for each assay on each reagent lot. The LoQ was determined separately for
each assay on each reagent lot by calculating the total imprecision of each sample. The LoQ
was defined as the lowest concentration level that meets the within-laboratory imprecision of
<20% for each lot. The greatest LoQ across the two lots was set as the LoQ value and as the
lower limit of the AMI for each assay.
The LoB, LoD, and LoQ for the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent and the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent
are summarized in the following table:
LoB LoD LoQ
(FLU) (FLU) (FLU)
Aptiva APS IgG Reagent
aCL IgG 0.00 0.07 0.29
aβ2GPI IgG 0.02 0.09 0.21
Aptiva APS IgM Reagent
aCL IgM 0.01 0.04 0.10
aβ2GPI IgM 0.03 0.06 0.10
8. Assay Cut-Off:
The following cut-off is used for the aCL IgG, aβ2GPI IgG assays in the Aptiva APS IgG
Reagent and aCL IgM and aβ2GPI IgM assays in the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent:
Positive: ≥5.00 FLU
Negative: <5.00 FLU
The cut-off was established based on greater than the 99th percentile of the results obtained
on the reference healthy population.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Samples for the Aptiva APS IgG and Aptiva APS IgM method comparison analysis included
serum samples from the clinical validation study (see VII.C) that display results within the
analytical measuring range of the assay and the respective predicate device(s). Positive

D Clinical Cut-Off:
Refer to assay cut-off.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
To determine the reference range of the Aptiva APS IgG and Aptiva APS IgM, a panel of 200
apparently healthy blood donors (106 females and 94 males, ages 18–70 years, and median age
of 37 years) were tested following CLSI EP28-A3c. With the cut-off of 5.0 FLU, no samples
tested positive for both the Aptiva APS IgG Reagent and the Aptiva APS IgM Reagent. The
results are summarized in the following table:
Min Max Medium 97.5th Percentile
Measurand N
(FLU) (FLU) (FLU) (FLU)
Aptiva APS IgG Reagent
aCL IgG 200 0.29 0.42 0.29 0.29
aβ2GPI IgG 200 0.21 0.47 0.21 0.21
