III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Healgen® Accurate Oral Fluid Drug Test COT is a lateral flow chromatographic
immunoassay for the qualitative detection of COT in oral fluid at the cut-off concentration 30
ng/mL.
This assay provides only a preliminary result. An alternative laboratory test must be used to
confirm the results provided by this drug test. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
is the preferred method confirmation test.
The Healgen® Accurate Oral Fluid Drug Test is a competitive binding lateral flow
immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative and simultaneous detection of Marijuana
(THC) and Cotinine in human oral fluid at the cutoff concentrations listed below and their
metabolites.
Test Calibrator Cut-off (ng/mL)
Cotinine (COT) (-) Cotinine 30
Marijuana (THC) Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol 40
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) are the preferred
confirmatory methods.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx and OTC
Healgen® Accurate Oral Fluid Drug Test COT is for OTC use only.
Healgen® Accurate Oral Fluid Drug Test is for Rx use only.
D Special Instrument Requirements:

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Healgen® Accurate Oral Fluid Drug Test is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay
for the qualitative detection of marijuana and cotinine in oral fluids at cut-off concentrations of
40 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL respectively for prescription use only. The Healgen® Accurate Oral
Fluid Drug Test COT is also a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative
detection of cotinine in oral fluids at a cut-off concentration of 30 ng/mL for over-the-counter
use only. Both assays provide only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
(LC/MS) are the preferred confirmatory methods.
Both tests contain mouse monoclonal antibody coupled particles and corresponding drug-protein
conjugates. A goat antibody is employed in each control line.
Kit Contents for Both Devices:
• Test device – Holder cartridge with cup insert, test strips and reagent pads
• Security seal labels
• Saliva collectors
• Package insert
B Principle of Operation:
Both tests are rapid immunoassays based on the principle of competitive inhibition binding.
Drugs that may be present in the oral fluid specimen compete for antibody binding sites with
drugs or metabolites which may be present in the oral fluid specimen.
In the absence of THC and/or COT in the oral fluid specimen the colloidal gold-labeled antibody
complex moves with the oral fluid by capillary action to contact the immobilized drug conjugate.
An antibody-antigen reaction occurs forming a visible line in the test area, The formation of two
(2) visible lines (control and test lines) occurs when the test is negative or below the cut-off for
the drug.
When THC and/or COT are present in the oral fluid specimen, the drug or metabolites will
compete with the immobilized drug conjugate in the test area for the antibody binding sites on
the colloidal gold-labeled antibody complex. If a sufficient amount of drug analyte is present it
will fill the available binding sites, thus preventing attachment of the drug labeled antibody to the
drug conjugate. The formation of one (1) visible line (control line, no test line) is indicative of a
preliminary positive result for the drug.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision-Reproducibility-Cut-Off studies were performed using the Healgen® Accurate
Oral Fluid Drug Test at three POC testing sites by three healthcare professionals. Samples
with concentrations of -100% cut-off, -75% cut-off, -50% cut-off, -25% cut-off, cut-off,
+25% cut-off, +50% cut-off, +75% cut-off and +100% cut-off were prepared by spiking
cotinine or marijuana in negative oral fluid samples. Each cotinine or marijuana
concentration was confirmed by LC/MS/MS. All sample aliquots were tested in a blinded
fashion. For each concentration, tests were performed on two runs per day for 25 days per
device lot in a randomized order. A total of 50 determinations by each operator at each
concentration were made.

Effect of Oral Fluid pH
To investigate the effect of oral fluid pH, oral fluid samples with pH ranging from 4 to 9
were spiked with target drugs at 50% below and 50% above cut-off levels. These samples
were tested using three lots of the device. Results were all positive for samples at and above
+50% of the cut-off and all negative for samples at and below -50% of the cut-off.
Drug Recovery Study
Negative oral fluid samples were spiked with target drugs to concentrations of -50% and
+50% of the cut-offs. The samples were transferred to Healgen devices and stored at room
temperature (20 to 25°C), frozen at -20oC, and stored at 40oC. Samples were also tested after
overnight shipment during the summer and winter. For room temperature, testing was done at
Day 0 and Day 2. For -20°C, testing was done at Day 0 and Day 90 (3 months). For 40°C,
testing was done at Day 0 and Day 1. The drug concentration was confirmed by LC-MS/MS.

All data show that the average recoveries are over 90% and that oral fluid samples can be
stored in the device at -20oC for at least 90 days, at 40oC for 2 days, and at room temperature
(20 to 25° C) for 2 days with no leakage observed. Oral fluid samples can be shipped
overnight in the device for LC-MS/MS confirmation.
Sample Volume Study
A sample volume study was conducted to show that the Healgen devices captured a
consistent volume of oral fluid sample and to determine the average duration of time to
saturation. Professional operators used the Healgen devices to collect oral fluid specimens
from study volunteers (71 smokers or drug users and 86 normal non-smoker and non-drug-
use volunteers). Using the provided collection swab, operators swept the inside of the
volunteer’s mouth (cheek, gums, and tongue), using a timer to record how long the swab was
held in their mouth until color appeared on the saturation strip in the indicator window. The
results showed that the saturation indicator appears within 7 minutes and the average sample
volume is 0.98±0.13mL for smokers/drug users and 1.0±0.10mL for non-smokers/non-drug-
users. These results demonstrate the reproducibility of adequate sample volume collection by
the device within the recommended 7 minute timeframe described in the instructions for use.
Read Time Study
COT Standards with concentrations of 15ng/mL, 45ng/mL and 60ng/mL in negative oral
fluid samples, THC Standards with concentrations of 40ng/mL, 60ng/mL and 80ng/mL in
negative oral fluid samples, and negative oral fluid from drug-free people were tested using
three lots of the device by three different operators according to procedures in the product
insert at different reading times of 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 120 minutes. False
positives were observed for read times up to 8 minutes. Expected results were observed for
all concentrations tested at reading times greater than 8 minutes and up to 120 minutes. These
results support the recommended 10 minute read time described in the instructions for use.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not Applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The device is traceable to commercial reference standards.
6. Detection Limit:

2. Clinical Specificity:
Not Applicable.
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
To support their proposed cutoff of 30 ng/mL for detection of cotinine, the sponsor provided
a pharmacokinetic study. Oral fluid samples in this study were evaluated both by the
sponsor’s device as well as confirmatory LC-MS/MS testing. The sponsor additionally
provided a description of the smoking habits and history of subjects in their lay user
study. After review, it was determined that the sponsor’s proposed cut-off was clinically
valid for the intended use of the device.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
