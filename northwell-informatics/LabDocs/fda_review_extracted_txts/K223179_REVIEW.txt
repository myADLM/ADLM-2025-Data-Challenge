• Cholesterol measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving excess
cholesterol in the blood and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism disorders.
• HDL (lipoprotein) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lipid disorders
(such as diabetes mellitus), atherosclerosis, and various liver and renal diseases.
• Triglyceride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with diabetes
mellitus, nephrosis, liver obstruction, other diseases involving lipid metabolism, or various
endocrine disorders.
• Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism
disorders including diabetes mellitus, idiopathic hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell
carcinoma.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Limitation – Cholestech LDXTM is not for use in children under the age of 2 years or patients
with hyperbilirubinemia (Elevated bilirubin levels).
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Cholestech LDX™ Analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Cholestech LDX™ System is a small, portable analyzer and test cassette system. The system
is for in vitro diagnostic use only. The Analyzer uses reflectance photometry (the amount of light
reflected from a solid surface) to determine the amount of the analyte in blood. The analyzer
measures color changes of the four reagent pads. The amount of color formed is converted by the
analyzer to a concentration and the results are shown on the liquid crystal display (LCD) screen.
The assays for use on the Analyzer include total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides (TRG), glucose (GLU), and by calculation, low-density
lipoprotein (LDL), non-HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio.
The modification that is the subject of this submission addresses revised bilirubin interference
claims for all analytes (see Section VII.A.3.) and includes a new limitation and a software
upgrade to mitigate the modified risks. The revised limitations consist of the statement
“Cholestech LDX™ is not for use in children under the age of 2 years or patients with
hyperbilirubinemia (Elevated bilirubin levels)”. The software upgrade incorporates the revised
limitations, displaying it on the Cholestech LDX™ analyzer screen, printing it on all paper test
results, and presenting it on all results sent to the electronic medical record.

VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:
CLSI – EP07-A3 – Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry – 3rd edition
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
This performance characteristic was established in the previous 510(k) submissions,
reviewed under K901900, K912136, K914469, K922612, K932727, K914033, K905296 and
K904082.
2. Linearity:
This performance characteristic was established in the previous 510(k) submissions,
reviewed under K901900, K912136, K914469, K922612, K932727, K914033, K905296 and
K904082.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference testing was performed based on guidance from CLSI EP07-A3 and a study
evaluating two interferents*, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin was conducted. For the
study, target analytes at different concentrations; triglycerides (100 mg/dL and 250 mg/dL),
HDL (30 mg/dL and 80 mg/dL), glucose (50-70 mg/dL, 110-130 mg/dL and 225-270
mg/dL), total cholesterol (150 mg/dL and 220 mg/dL) were created in pooled samples that
were spiked with the interferents, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, at a range of
concentrations. Samples were tested in replicates of sixteen (16) using three (3) Cholestech
LDX™ Lipid Profile Glucose test cassettes, on sixteen (16) Cholestech LDX™ Analyzers.
The following table list the concentration of each substance at which no significant
interference was detected; defined by the sponsor as a difference of less than or equal to
±10% between the test sample and control:
Analyte Target Highest concentration Highest concentration

Potential interference from conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin was also estimated for the
calculated parameters.

system for conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin to indicate that concentrations up to 2.5
mg/dL do not interfere with the test system.
