IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
HemosIL Liquid Anti-Xa is a one stage chromogenic assay based on a synthetic chromogenic
substrate and on Factor Xa inactivation. The assay provides quantitative heparin,
apixaban, and rivaroxaban results on 3.2% citrated human plasma when used with HemosIL
Heparin Calibrators, HemosIL Apixaban Calibrators and/or Rivaroxaban Calibrators.
The HemosIL Liquid Anti-Xa assay consists:
4mL Kit Vial Size
• Factor Xa reagent 5 x 2.5 mL vial of a liquid preparation containing purified bovine Factor
Xa, Tris-Buffer, EDTA, dextran sulfate, sodium chloride and bovine serum albumin
• Chromogenic substrate 5 x 3 mL vial of liquid chromogenic substrate S-2732 and bulking
agent
10mL Kit Vial Size
• Factor Xa reagent 5 x 5 mL vial of a liquid preparation containing purified bovine Factor
Xa, Tris-Buffer, EDTA, dextran sulfate, sodium chloride and bovine serum albumin
• Chromogenic substrate 5 x 6 mL vial of liquid chromogenic substrate S-2732 and bulking
agent
The assay requires the following components which are not included in the assay kit:
• HemosIL Rivaroxaban Calibrators- two levels (0 and 500 ng/mL) of lyophilized calibrators
prepared from human citrated plasma containing rivaroxaban, buffers, and stabilizers.
• HemosIL Rivaroxaban Controls- two levels (80 and 300 ng/mL) of lyophilized controls
prepared from human citrated plasma containing rivaroxaban, buffers, and stabilizers.
• HemosIL Apixaban Calibrators and Controls refer to DEN190032.
• HemosIL Heparin Calibrator and Controls (LMWH and UFH) refer to K090209.
• Cleaning solution
• Cleaning agent
• Factor diluent
B Principle of Operation:
The HemosIL Liquid Anti-Xa is an anti-factor Xa one-stage chromogenic assay. When an excess
amount of factor Xa is added to a sample containing rivaroxaban, factor Xa is partially
K223187 - Page 3 of 12

--- Page 4 ---
neutralized by rivaroxaban. Residual factor Xa is quantified when the synthetic chromogenic
substrate is added to the patient sample. The released paranitroaniline (pNA) is released and
monitored kinetically at 405 nm. The measured pNA is inversely proportional to rivaroxaban
levels. Thus, maximum absorption occurs with low levels of drug, and minimum absorption
occurs with high levels of drug.

2. Linearity:
Linearity studies were performed following the CLSI EP06-A2 guideline using three
different reagent lots tested on a representative ACL TOP Family and an ACL TOP Family
50 series model. Normal Pooled Plasma spiked with known concentrations of rivaroxaban
was tested in four replicates. Two separate linear regressions were performed. For the first,
samples with thirteen different concentrations were evaluated to establish the analytical
measuring interval; and for the second, samples with nine different concentrations were
evaluated to establish the extended measuring interval.
Based on the results of the Linearity studies and Detection Limit studies, the claimed assay
reportable range is 20–1000 ng/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were conducted based on the CLSI EP07-A2 guideline and CLSI EP37
guideline. The study design included one representative instrument model and one regent lot.
Potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances were spiked into the test
samples (rivaroxaban at 50 ng/mL, 180 ng/mL or 400 ng/mL native donor samples collected
at peak and trough), and each sample level were run in five replicates on an ACL TOP family
instrument.
Rivaroxaban results on ACL TOP Family and ACL TOP Family 50 Series are not affected
by the interferents listed up to the concentrations detailed in the table below.
Interfering Substances Concentration without Interference
Hemoglobin 600 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 40 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated) 40 mg/dL
Triglycerides 921 mg/dL
Lupus anticoagulant dRVVT Screen/Confirm Ratio 2.47
(dRVVT: Diluted Russell Viper Venom Time)
Acetylsalicylic acid 3.00 mg/dL
Atorvastatin 0.075 mg/dL
Isosorbide dinitrate 0.600 mg/dL
Ticagrelor 0.188 mg/dL
Warfarin 7.50 mg/dL
Rivaroxaban results may be falsely elevated in samples tested post-andexanet alfa
administration.
The assay is not intended for the monitoring and dosage adjustment of rivaroxaban.
Administer a reversal agent based on current clinical guidance, and take into consideration
other clinical and laboratory findings including the Factor Xa inhibitor dose and time since
last dose. For additional information, refer to current clinical guidance and reversal agent
prescribing information.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
HemosIL Liquid Anti-Xa Assay Reportable Range: 20–1000 ng/mL rivaroxaban.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
Calibrator value assignments are traceable to Rivaroxaban supplied by the manufacturer and
quantitated in plasmas assayed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS). Two levels of lyophilized calibrators prepared from human citrated plasma by
means of a dedicated process at two different concentrations containing rivaroxaban, buffers,
and stabilizers. A house standard lot of HemosIL Rivaroxaban Calibrators is used to value
assign each new lot of Rivaroxaban Calibrator 2.
Expected values:
Calibrator 1: 0 ng/mL
Calibrator 2: 500 ng/mL
HemosIL Liquid Anti-Xa assay uses Rivaroxaban Controls when calibrated with HemosIL
Rivaroxaban Calibrators. Two levels of lyophilized HemosIL Rivaroxaban controls are
prepared from human citrated plasma by means of a dedicated process at two different
concentrations containing rivaroxaban, buffers, and stabilizers.
Expected values:
Low Control : 80 ng/mL
High Control : 300 ng/mL
Sample Stability
Sample stability studies were performed to support the recommended storage and handling
instructions detailed in device labeling. Citrated plasma samples were tested after storage in
the following temperature ranges 15–25°C and 2–8°C. The study was performed using one
reagent lot with three contrived samples and two native (trough and peak) samples. The
contrived samples were tested in quadruplicate and native samples were tested in 8 replicates
for baseline then in quadruplicate for various time intervals. The study demonstrated
specimens are stable up to 24 hours at 15–25°C and up to 7 days at 2–8°C.
Reagent Stability
The results support the following claim: Open Vial 2–8°C for 1 month, On-Board Instrument
15–25°C for 4 days, Shelf-life 2–8°C for 30 Months.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) for the
test system was determined following CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Each study design included
three reagent lots, an ACL TOP Family and ACL TOP Family 50 Series instruments.
The LoB was determined using four citrated plasma pools containing no rivaroxaban. Three
replicate measurements were tested for each of the four plasma pools on five different days
on two different instrument models for 60 determinations per reagent lot per instrument
model. The LoB was determined to be 2.4 ng/mL.
The LoD was determined using four citrated plasma pools containing low levels of
rivaroxaban around 10 ng/mL. Three replicate measurements were tested for each of the four
K223187 - Page 10 of 12

plasma pools on five different days on two different instrument models for 60 determinations
per reagent lot per instrument model. The LoD was determined to be 8 ng/mL.
The LoQ was determined using four citrated plasma pools spiked with four target
concentration 15, 20, 30, 50 ng/mL of rivaroxaban. Eight replicate measurements were tested
for each of the four plasma pools on five different days on two different instrument models
for 40 determinations per reagent lot per instrument model. The LoQ was determined to be
20 ng/mL.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The HemosIL Liquid Anti-Xa assay is not intended to monitor patients on rivaroxaban therapy.
Rivaroxaban does not require therapeutic monitoring, thus, there is no standard therapeutic range
as the on-therapy range may be different for each individual patient.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
