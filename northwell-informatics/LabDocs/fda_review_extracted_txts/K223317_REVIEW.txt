III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Alkaline Phosphatase2 assay is used for the quantitation of alkaline phosphatase in human
serum or plasma on the ARCHITECT c System. Measurements of alkaline phosphatase or its
isoenzymes are to be used as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of liver, bone, parathyroid,
and intestinal diseases.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
ARCHITECT c8000
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Alkaline Phosphatase2 assay kit consists of two ready to use reagent solutions, R1 and R2.
R1 is a buffer solution containing 179.550 g/L of 2-amino-2-methylpropanol(AMP) and sodium
azide as a preservative. R2 is a substrate solution containing 30.430 g/L of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate
and sodium azide as a preservative.
The Alkaline Phosphatase2 assay has two approaches to calculate results, i.e., calibration method
and calibration factor method. The user decides which of the two methods to use. The calibration
factor method allows users to perform testing without using a physical calibrator. There are
separate assay parameter files that user must upload to the instrument for use with each method.
• The calibration method utilizes the linear data reduction method based on the Consolidated
Chemistry Calibrator to generate a calibration and results.
• The calibration factor method utilizes the factor data reduction method to generate a
calibration and results. The calibration factor for the Alkaline Phosphatase2 assay is 1931.
B Principle of Operation:
Alkaline Phosphatase in a sample catalyzes the hydrolysis of colorless para-nitrophenyl
phosphate (p-NPP) to give para-nitrophenol (yellow phenoxide form at alkaline pH) and
inorganic phosphate.
The rate of absorbance increase at 404 nm is directly proportional to the alkaline phosphatase
activity in the sample. Optimized concentrations of zinc and magnesium ions are present to
activate the alkaline phosphatase in the sample.

(14) levels of samples were prepared by mixing different portions of a high sample and a blank
sample. Each sample was tested in four (4) replicates on a single instrument using a single
reagent lot in a single run. The results were analyzed using weighted least squares linear
regression analysis. The results of the linearity regression analysis of the data are summarized

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the Alkaline Phosphatase2 assay on the ARCHITECT c8000 was
established by conducting interference testing following the recommendations in the CLSI
EP07 third edition guideline.
Interference from endogenous and exogenous substances was assessed using two serum
samples with alkaline phosphatase concentration of 70U/L and 200 U/L. Each sample was
further divided into two aliquots: a test sample (with added interferent) and a control sample
(with no added interferent). Each sample was tested in ten (10) replicates using one (1)
instrument and one (1) reagent lot. The difference and % difference between the mean
concentration of the test and control sample were calculated.
The following tables list the highest concentration of each substance at which no significant
interference was found, defined as a difference of less than or equal to ±10% between the test
sample and control.

of 2 instruments (i.e., 6 conditions) over a minimum of three (3) days using both the calibration
method and calibration factor method.
The limit of blank (LoB) was evaluated and determined by running a zero-analyte sample. The
limit of detection (LoD) and the limit of quantitation (LoQ) were determined using low-analyte
samples. Each sample was measured in at least 60 replicates using each of three lots of reagents
and two instruments (total of six instrument and reagent lot combinations). The highest LoB,
LoD, and LoQ estimate from the six instrument and reagent lot combinations was used as the
LoB, LoD and LoQ for the assay.
The LoB was determined non-parametrically as the 95th percentile from n=60 replicates of the
zero-target samples. LoD was analyzed using a parametric data analysis method where the
lowest concentration at which the analyte can be detected with 95% probability based on n=60
replicates of low-analyte level samples is considered the LoD. The LoQ was defined as the
lowest concentration of analyte which has imprecision less than or equal to 20% CV. The
results are summarized in the table below.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed following CLSI EP09-A3. The accuracy of the
Alkaline Phosphatase2 assay on the ARCHITECT c8000 for serum samples was evaluated for
agreement with the predicate device.
In this study, a total of 145 serum samples were tested and less than 10% of the samples were
prepared by spiking or diluting specimens. The data were analyzed by Passing-Bablok
regression using the first replicate of the candidate device results compared to the mean of the
duplicate results from the comparator device. Method comparison study results are
summarized below.

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix equivalency study was conducted to support use of the Alkaline Phosphatase2 assay
with the following additional specimen matrix types claimed in the product labeling: serum
(separator tubes), lithium heparin plasma, lithium heparin (separator tubes) plasma and sodium
heparin plasma. In the study, matched venous specimens were collected into each
anticoagulant tube (i.e., evaluation tubes) and the serum control tube.
Each specimen was tested using one lot of reagents and one ARCHITECT c8000 instrument.
The first replicate of the evaluation tubes was compared to the mean of the control serum
measurements. A Passing-Bablok evaluation was performed, and results are summarized
below:
