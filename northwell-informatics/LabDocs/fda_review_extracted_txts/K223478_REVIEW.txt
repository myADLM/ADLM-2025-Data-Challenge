D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using 9.04 software.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card
VITEK 2 AST-GN Plazomicin has the following concentrations in the card: 2, 4, and 8, μg/mL
(equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The MIC result range for the
VITEK 2 AST-GN Plazomicin is ≤0.5 - ≥16 µg/mL.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST- Gram Negative Plazomicin was conducted at
three external sites using a panel of ten Gram negative organisms consistent with the
indications for use (i.e., three isolates of Escherichia coli and seven isolates of Klebsiella
pneumoniae). Each isolate was tested in triplicate, using separate inocula, over three days for
a total of 270 data points. Inocula were prepared using both the auto-dilution and manual
dilution methods for testing with the VITEK 2 System. In addition, inocula were prepared by
the manual dilution method for testing with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode of MIC values
was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was calculated based on the number
of MIC values that fell within ± one doubling dilution of the mode MIC value. The majority
of data points were on-scale and within ± one doubling dilution agreement as compared to
the mode MIC. The data was analyzed taking into consideration best-case and worst-case
scenarios as described in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. The overall reproducibility performance was acceptable
(Table 1).

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The CLSI recommended QC strains, namely Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, were tested a sufficient number of times (i.e., at
least 20/site) at each testing site using both the VITEK 2 AST-GN Plazomicin and Broth
Microdilution (BMD) reference method. Both the automatic dilution and manual dilution
methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual dilution method was used for the
VITEK 2 Compact. The results are summarized in Table 2 below. Both the auto-dilution
and the manual dilution methods for VITEK 2 and the manual dilution for VITEK 2
Compact QC results were within the expected range >95% of the time, which is acceptable.
The BMD dilution range (≤0.0625 - ≥128 μg/mL) covered the full expected result range of E.
coli ATCC 25922 (expected range of 0.25-2 μg/mL) and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853
(expected range of 1-4 μg/mL); however, the VITEK 2 Plazomicin card (≤0.5 - ≥16 μg/mL)
resulted in off-scale MIC values for E. coli ATCC 25922. An E. coli ATCC 25922 MIC
value of ≤0.5 μg/mL (with VITEK 2) was considered as an indication that the quality control
test results were acceptable.
To address the potential off-scale QC results when testing E. coli ATCC 25922, the sponsor
included a footnote in labeling to indicate that the device does not include the full
CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution range for QC testing.

recommended dilution range for QC testing of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. The lowest concentration of the
VITEK 2 Plazomicin MIC range is 0.5 μg/mL. Obtaining a value of ≤0.5 μg/mL was considered an indication
that the quality control test results were acceptable.
2BMD: CLSI reference broth microdilution
One ancillary quality control organism was tested throughout comparative testing by broth
microdilution reference method only. This was done to perform further quality control of the
broth microdilution panels. The organism tested was Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213. QC
results for the broth microdilution method were within the expected result range 100% of the
time (207/207).
Inoculum Density Control:
The DensiCHEK Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a 0.5 McFarland standard. The
instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at each site. Calibration values were
within the expected range.
Purity Check:
A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to prepare the VITEK 2
card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in the study.
Device Failure:
During the performance of the comparative study, there were 12 device failures (e.g., instrument
did not fill a card properly, pipettor error, inability to connect to computer) that resulted in loss
of AST cards with the VITEK 2 System and VITEK 2 Compact system. All isolates affected by
these errors were retested in accordance with the testing protocol.
Growth Failure Rate:
A total of 860 clinical and challenge isolates were tested by VITEK 2 AST-GN Plazomicin. Two
clinical isolates failed to grow. Results for 858 clinical and challenge isolates on the VITEK 2
AST were available.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Testing of Plazomicin on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative card was performed at four
external sites and one internal site. There were 783 clinical isolates and 75 challenge isolates
tested for a total of 858 isolates tested. Results obtained with VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative
Plazomicin were compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution reference
(BMD) panel. The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Plazomicin is ≤
0.5 - ≥ 16 µg/mL for all species. The testing conditions for the reference method consisted of
the following:
• Medium: Cation Adjusted Mueller Hinton broth
• Inoculum: direct colony suspension
• Incubation: 35 ± 2°C ambient air; 16-24 hours
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test
inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using
the DensiCHEK Plus instrument.
A total of 783 clinical isolates (14 C. freundii, 34 C. koseri, 30 K. aerogenes, 27 E. cloacae,
3 E. cloacae complex, 299 E. coli, 30 K. oxytoca, 300 K. pneumoniae, 16 P. vulgaris, and 30
S. marcescens) were evaluated using auto-dilution and VITEK 2. Of these isolates, 61.9%
were recent isolates (tested within one year of isolation) and 38.1% were stock isolates (no
specific time from isolation). A total of 75 challenge isolates (6 E. cloacae, 29 E. coli, 2 K.
oxytoca, 37 K. pneumoniae, and 1 S. marcescens) were evaluated. The challenge set was
tested with the auto-dilution and manual dilution options of the VITEK 2 and with the
manual dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact. The results obtained using the VITEK 2
autodilution and manual dilution methods for Plazomicin are summarized in Table 3.

Essential agreement (EA) occurs when the result of the reference method and that of the VITEK 2 AST-Gram
Negative Plazomicin are within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are
those that are on-scale for both the reference method and the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Plazomicin or
results in which an off scale result is at least two doubling dilutions from the on scale result. Category agreement
(CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation
provided by the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Negative Plazomicin.
For all organisms evaluated using the auto-dilution method and manual dilution of the
VITEK 2, EA was acceptable at >90% and CA was acceptable at >90% (Table 3). No very
major errors were observed. One major error was observed for Klebsiella pneumoniae with
the VITEK 2 autodilution method but determined to be acceptable. Due to the insufficient
number of evaluable results for organisms tested with the VITEK 2 auto dilution method, the
CA and overall EA were used to evaluate performance and because of the lack of very major
errors or major errors, the performance was considered acceptable.
An insufficient number of resistant isolates were evaluated in the comparative study. To
address the lack of information regarding performance with resistant strains, the following
limitation was added to the device labeling:
The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s) is
unknown because resistant strains were not available at the time of comparative testing:
Plazomicin (plz01n): Citrobacter fruendii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella (Enterobacter)
aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens
As required under 511A(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the
following statement is included in the Precautions section of the device labeling to address
testing and reporting of non-indicated species:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and
efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this
AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.
Trending
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method. This trending calculation analyzes device MIC

values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher than the
reference method. MIC values that are off-scale for both the reference and device are not
considered in the trending analysis. Species for which the difference between the percentage
of isolates with higher or lower MIC values was ≥ 30% with a statistically significant
confidence interval were considered to have evidence of trending and is addressed in the
labeling. Evaluable results for trending were not available for E. Cloacae, E. cloacae
complex, K. pneumoniae ssp. ozaenae, and K. pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae. The trending
results are summarized in Table 4.

A trend toward higher MIC values was observed for K. pneumoniae (Table 4). To
address the observed trending, the following footnote was included by the sponsor to the
performance table in the device labeling:
VITEK 2 AST-GN Plazomicin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one
doubling dilution higher when testing K. pneumoniae compared to the CLSI reference broth
microdilution method.
A trend toward higher MIC values was observed for E. coli and S. marcescens (Table 4). To
address the observed trending, the following footnote was included by the sponsor to the
performance table in the device labeling:
VITEK 2 AST-GN Plazomicin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device when evaluated with
the current FDA-recognized Plazomicin breakpoints.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 System with Plazomicin when revised breakpoints for
Plazomicin are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the
Plazomicin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
