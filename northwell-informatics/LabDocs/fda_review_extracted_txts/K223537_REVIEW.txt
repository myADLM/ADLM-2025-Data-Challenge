MRI/CT/Diathermy: The System must be removed prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. The
effect of MRI, CT scans, or diathermy on the performance of the System has not been evaluated.
The exposure may damage the Sensor and may impact proper function of the device which could
cause incorrect readings.
D Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The following special conditions for use statements apply to the Libre Data Sharing API:
• Use of the Libre Data Sharing API and the CGM information it transmits is limited by the
indications for use of the iCGM systems with which it is used.
The following special conditions for use statements apply to the FreeStyle Libre 2 (FSL2)
device:
• Taking ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely
raise Sensor glucose readings. Inaccurate sensor readings due to ascorbic acid
interference may be clinical significant and result in harm if relied on to make treatement
decisions. Taking more than 500 mg of ascorbic acid per day may affect the Sensor
readings which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event.
• Do not use this system if you are pregnant, on dialysis, or critically ill. The System is not
cleared for use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or
medications common to these populations may affect performance of the System.
• Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: if you are
experiencing symptoms that are not consistent with the glucose readings, consult your
health care professional.
• Do not use the System in people less than 4 years of age.
• Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the
"check blood glucose" symbol during the first 12 hours of wearing a Sensor. In addition,
use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions, if your Sensor
glucose reading does not match how you feel, or if the reading does not include a
number.
• Wash application site on the back of your upper arm using a plain soap, dry, and then
clean with an alcohol wipe. This will help remove any oily residue that may prevent the
sensor from sticking properly. Allow site to air dry before proceeding. Carefully
preparing the site according to these instructions will help the Sensor stay on your body
for the full wear duration specified by your Sensor insert and help prevent it from falling
off early.
• Store the Sensor Kit between 36°F and 82°F. Storage outside of this range may cause
inaccurate Sensor glucose readings. If you suspect that the temperature may exceed 82°F
(e.g., an un-airconditioned home in the summer), you should refrigerate your Sensor Kit.
Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.
• The Reader's built-in meter is not for use on people who are dehydrated, hypotensive, in
shock, or for individuals in hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state, with or without ketosis.
• The Reader's built-in meter is not for use on neonates, in critically-ill patients, or for
diagnosis or screening of diabetes.
• The Reader's built-in meter is for use by a single person. Use of the Reader's built-in
meter on multiple patients may lead to transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus
K223537 - Page 3 of 10

--- Page 4 ---
(HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or other bloodborne
pathogens.
• Use of the Sensor with devices, apps, and software that are not listed (as compatible) may
cause inaccurate glucose readings.
• If a Sensor breaks inside a user's body, call your health care professional.
• Alarms you receive do not include your glucose reading. You must scan the Sensor to
get your real-time current glucose level as the Reader and App will not provide this
information without a scan.
• For you to receive alarms, they must be on in your Reader. If you want to receive the
App's optional alarms, make sure these are turned on. The Reader or phone should be
within 20 feet of you at all times. The transmission range is 20 feet unobstructed. If you
are out of range, you may not receive glucose alarms.
• To prevent missed alarms, make sure the Reader has sufficient charge and that sound
and/or vibration are turned on.
• The App will ask for phone permissions which are needed to receive alarms. Allow these
permissions when requested.
• Check to make sure that you have the correct phone settings and permissions enabled. If
your phone is not configured properly, you will not be able to use the App, so you will
not receive alarms or be able to check your glucose.
• Do not force close the App (iOS). The App must be running in the background to receive
alarms. If you force close the App you will not receive alarms. Re-open the App to ensure
you will receive alarms.
• If you adjust the phone ringer volume (iPhone) or Media volume (Android) to silent or
use the phone Do Not Disturb setting, keep ‘Override Do Not Disturb’ setting in the App
ON for Low Glucose, High Glucose, and Signal Loss alarms to ensure you receive
audible alarms.
• You should disconnect headphones or speakers from your phone when you are not using
them as you may not hear audio for alarms. If using headphones, keep them in your ears.
• If you are using peripheral devices connected to your phone, such as wireless headphones
or a smartwatch, you may receive alarms on only one device or peripheral, not all.
• Some operating system features may impact your ability to receive alarms. For example,
if you use an iPhone and the iOS Screen Time feature, add FreeStyle Libre 2 to the list of
Always Allowed apps to ensure that you receive alarms or if you use an Android Phone
do not use the Android Digital Wellbeing app.
• Keep your phone well charged and turned on.
• If you are using FreeStyle Libre 2 App, you must have access to a blood glucose
monitoring system as the App does not provide one.
• FreeStyle Libre 2 System is intended for use by a single person. It must not be used by
more than one person due to the risk of misinterpreting glucose information.
The following special conditions for use statements apply to the FreeStyle Libre 3 (FSL3)
(FSL3) device:
• Do not use the System in people less than 4 years of age. The System is not cleared for
use in people under 4 years of age.
• Do not use the System if you are pregnant, on dialysis, or critically ill. The System is not
cleared for use in these groups and it is not known how different conditions or
medications common to these populations may affect performance of the System.
K223537 - Page 4 of 10

--- Page 5 ---
• The FreeStyle Libre 3 app installed on a phone is intended for use by a single person. It
must not be used by more than one person due to the risk of misinterpreting glucose
information.
• Performance of the System when used with other implanted medical devices, such as
pacemakers, has not been evaluated.
• Taking ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplements while wearing the Sensor may falsely raise
Sensor glucose readings. Taking more than 500 mg of ascorbic acid per day may affect
the Sensor readings which could cause you to miss a severe low glucose event. Ascorbic
acid can be found in supplements including multivitamins. Some supplements, including
cold remedies such as Airborne® and Emergen-C®, may contain high doses of 1000 mg
of ascorbic acid and should not be taken while using the Sensor. See your health care
professional to understand how long ascorbic acid is active in your body.
• Do not ignore symptoms that may be due to low or high blood glucose: if you are
experiencing symptoms that are not consistent with the glucose readings, consult your
health care professional.
• Use your blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions when you see the
symbol during the first 12 hours of wearing a Sensor, if your Sensor glucose reading does
not match how you feel or if the reading does not include a number.
• For you to receive alarms, they must be on and your device should be within 33 feet of
you at all times. The transmission range is 33 feet unobstructed. If you are out of range,
you may not receive alarms.
• If you suspect that the temperature may exceed 82°F (for example, in an unairconditioned
home in summer), you should refrigerate your Sensor Kit. Do not freeze your Sensor Kit.
• Do not force close the App. The App must be running in the background to receive
alarms. If you force close the App you will not receive alarms. Re-open the App to ensure
you will receive alarms.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The subject devices are the FreeStyle Libre 2 (FSL2) Flash Glucose Monitoring System and the
FreeStyle Libre 3 (FSL3) Continuous Glucose Monitoring System. Both systems utilize the
FreeStyle Libre App with different app versions for the FSL2 and FSL3, and both app versions
are available on Apple and Android mobile phone operating systems. The device descriptions of
the FSL2 and FSL3 systems are unchanged from K210943 and K213996, respectively.
As part of the current 510(k) the subject devices are receiving additional functionality called the
“Libre Data Sharing API.”
The Libre Data Sharing API is a cloud-based application programming interface (API) that is
intended to enable communication of glucose data, including alarms, through the cloud from an
FDA cleared Abbott iCGM system, consisting of an on-body sensor and a primary display
device, to an authorized third-party organization (‘client’) software on digitally connected
devices. The data transmitted by the API to an authorized client software can be used for specific
and permitted use cases, including non-medical device applications, medical device data
analysis, CGM secondary display alarm, active patient monitoring, and treatment decisions. Use
of the Libre Data Sharing API and the CGM information it transmits is limited by the indications
for use of the iCGM systems with which it is used.
K223537 - Page 5 of 10

--- Page 6 ---
The Libre Data Sharing API does not have any command or control over the client software, nor
does it allow for the client software to have any command or control over the connected iCGM
system. Additionally, glucose data and alarms from the connected iCGM system are not
modified or manipulated by the Libre Data Sharing API through its transmission to the
authorized client software. The display device of the connected Abbott iCGM system, which
directly receives the data from the sensor, continues to serve as a primary display device for the
glucose data and alarms. As part of this 510(k) there are no modifications to the sensors,
transmitters, or user interfaces of the FSL2 or FSL3 systems.
As a component of iCGM systems, the Libre Data Sharing API is subject to the applicable
special controls defined in 21 CFR 862.1355. FDA determined that the technical design of the
Libre Data Sharing API and the verification and validation testing provided in the current 510(k)
are adequate to meet the iCGM special controls. In addition to these regulatory controls, Abbott
Diabetes Care elected to use a “whitelist” approach to control access to the API, such that access
by 3rd party developers will require prior authorization from Abbott Diabetes Care.
