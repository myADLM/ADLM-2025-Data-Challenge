III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access Folate assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of folic acid levels in human serum, lithium heparin plasma, and red
blood cells using the Access Immunoassay Systems.
Folic acid measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of megaloblastic anemia.
Folate levels in serum, lithium heparin plasma, and red blood cells are used to assess folate
status. The serum folate levels is an indicator of recent folate intake. A low RBC folate value can
indicate a prolonged folate deficiency.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Access Folate assay consists of the reagent pack and calibrators. Reagent pack is provided in
two assay packs containing 50 tests per pack for 100 tests. The Access Folate reagent pack is
consists of the following reagents:
• R1a: Mouse monoclonal anti-folate binding protein, paramagnetic particles coated with
goat anti-mouse IgG, buffer, human serum albumin (HSA) and 0.1% ProClin* 300.
• R1b: 1.0M Ascorbate, 0.05N HCl, pH 5.5
• R1c: Milk folate binding protein (bovine) in buffer, HSA and 0.1% ProClin 300.
• R1d: Folic acid alkaline phosphate (bovine) conjugate buffer, HSA and 0.1% ProClin
300.
• R1e: 0.6M K PO4

Other materials needed to run the assay, but not included in the kit include: Access Folate
Calibrators, Quality Control (QC) materials, Lumi-Phos PRO, UniCel DxI Wash Buffer II,
Access Red Blood Cell Folate Lysing Agent, and Access Wash Buffer II.

B Principle of Operation:
The Access Folate assay is a competitive binding immunoenzymatic assay. For the assay of
folate in serum or lithium heparin plasma, no pre-treatment is required. For the assay of folate in
red blood cells, a whole blood sample is first treated off-line with a lysing agent composed of
ascorbic acid. This pre-treatment hemolyzes the red blood cells and converts the folate to
polyglutamic acid forms present in red cells to the monoglutamic acid form predominant in
serum. The sample from the pre-treatment of whole blood is defined as hemolysate.
Fifty-five (55) µL of sample (105 µL when using the automated dilution feature) is added to a
reaction vessel with folate binding protein, mouse anti-folate binding protein, folic acid-alkaline
phosphatase conjugate, and paramagnetic particles coupled with goat anti-mouse capture
antibody. Folate in the sample competes with the folic acid-alkaline phosphatase conjugate for
binding sites on a limited amount of folate binding protein. Resulting complexes bind to the solid
phase via mouse anti-folate binding protein. After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase
are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured
with a luminometer. The light production is inversely proportional to the concentration of analyte
in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point
calibration curve.
Red blood cell (RBC) folate is calculated by multiplying the RBC folate hemolysate result by 21
to correct for the 1:21 dilution that was made during preparation of the hemolysate, and then
dividing the result by the patient's hematocrit.

Precision studies were conducted following the recommendations in the CLSI EP05-A3
guideline.
Serum: To estimate repeatability and within-laboratory imprecision, five (5) levels of serum
were tested using 3 lots of reagent, 3 lots of calibrator, and 3 DxI 9000 Immunoassay
analyzers. Each sample was assayed in duplicate, in two runs per day, over 22 days for a total
of 44 runs and 88 replicates per instrument. Each instrument was evaluated with one reagent
lot. Within-run, between-run, between-day, and total imprecision was calculated. Results
from multiple lots were similar. Results from one representative lot are provided in the table

2. Linearity:
Serum
A linearity study was conducted according to CLSI EP06-2nd edition. A total of 9 levels of
serum samples ranging from 0.480 to 30.848 ng/mL were prepared by mixing different
proportions of a serum sample containing a high concentration of folate with a serum sample
containing a low concentration of folate. The lowest sample was run in 8 replicates, and all
other samples were run in 4 replicates. Samples were tested on 3 DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzers using 3 reagent lots and three calibrator lots. The data was analyzed
using a weighted linear regression model. The deviation from linearity did not exceed 5%
within the claimed measuring interval.

Hemolysate
A linearity study was conducted according to CLSI EP06-2nd edition. A total of 9 levels of
hemolysate samples ranging from 0.30 to 33.2 ng/mL were prepared by mixing different
proportions of a hemolysate sample containing a high concentration of folate with a
hemolysate sample containing a low concentration of folate. The lowest sample was run in 8
replicates, and all other samples were run in 4 replicates. Samples were tested on a single DxI
9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers using a single reagent lot and a single calibrator lot.
The data was analyzed using a weighted linear regression model. The deviation from
linearity did not exceed 8% within the claimed measuring interval.
The results support the sponsor’s claimed measuring interval of 2 – 24.8 ng/mL.
