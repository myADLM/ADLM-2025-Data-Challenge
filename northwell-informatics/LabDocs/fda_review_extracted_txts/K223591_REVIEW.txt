C Type of Test:
This assay is a multiplex nucleic acid assay for the qualitative detection and differentiation of
SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B RNA through nucleic acid extraction, amplification,
and detection using real-time RT-PCR. All steps of the assay are automated within the cobas Liat
System, after scanning the specimen ID barcode, scanning the assay tube barcode, and the
manual addition of sample into the assay tube.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B nucleic acid test for use on the cobas Liat System
(cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B) is an automated rapid multiplex real-time, reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test intended for the simultaneous qualitative
detection and differentiation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
influenza A, and/or influenza B virus nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and anterior
nasal swab (ANS) specimens from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract
infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection due to SARS-CoV-2 and
influenza can be similar.
cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of
SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and/or influenza B infection if used in conjunction with other clinical

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Overview:
The cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B Nucleic Acid Test for Use on the cobas Liat
System (cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B) is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test
for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B RNA in
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and nasal swab (NS) specimens eluted in viral transport media.
The assay targets both the ORF1 a/b non-structural region and nucleocapsid protein gene that are
unique to SARS-CoV-2, a well-conserved region of the matrix gene of influenza A, and the non-
structural protein gene of influenza B. An Internal Process Control (IPC) is also included. The
IPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target viruses and to monitor the presence
of inhibitors in the sample preparation and RT-PCR.
The assay utilizes a single-use disposable cobas assay tube that holds the sample purification and
PCR reagents and hosts the sample preparation and PCR processes. The cobas assay tube uses a
flexible tube as a sample vessel. It contains all required unit dose reagents pre-packed in tube
segments, separated by peelable seals, in the order of reagent use.
The cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay uses silica magnetic particle-based nucleic acid
extraction and TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR amplification and detection. The cobas Liat
Analyzer automates and integrates sample purification, nucleic acid amplification, and detection
of the target sequence in biological samples. During the testing process, multiple sample
processing actuators of the cobas Liat Analyzer compress the cobas Liat Tube to selectively
release reagents from tube segments, move the sample from one segment to another, and control
reaction volume, temperature, and incubation time. The cobas Liat Analyzer software controls
and coordinates these actions to perform all required assay processes, including sample
preparation, nucleic acid extraction, target enrichment, inhibitor removal, nucleic acid elution,
and real-time PCR. All assay steps are performed within the closed and self-contained
cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay tube.
The cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B for use on the Liat System contains the same sample
preparation and PCR reaction chemistry as the previously cleared cobas Influenza A/B & RSV
for use on the Liat System (K153544). Minor changes were made to the cleared assay that
included removing the RSV primers and probes and adding the primers and probes for SARS-
CoV-2, as well as developing the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Positive Control.
B Principle of Operation:
The cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay is performed on the cobas Liat Analyzer which
automates and integrates sample purification, nucleic acid amplification, and detection of the
target sequence in biological samples using real-time RT-PCR assays. The assay targets both the
ORF1 a/b non-structural region and nucleocapsid protein gene that are unique to SARS-CoV-2, a
well-conserved region of the matrix gene of influenza A, and the non-structural protein gene of
influenza B. An Internal Process Control (IPC) is also included. The IPC is present to control for
K223591 - Page 3 of 34

--- Page 4 ---
adequate processing of the target virus through steps of sample purification, nucleic acid
amplification, and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the RT-PCR processes.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Cobas Liat Analyzer, including cobas Liat System software (core) version 3.3 or higher
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is either entered manually or via barcode
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) or nasal swab (NS) specimens collected in 3 mL viral transport
media or 0.9% physiological saline
4. Calibration:
The analyzer performs self-diagnostics during startup (initialization) and utilizes an advanced
error diagnostics system to monitor the analyzer’s performance during an assay. Under
normal operation, the analyzer alerts the operator if a malfunction or error is detected. The
analyzer requires no adjustment or calibration from the operator.
5. Quality Control:
The assay contains an internal process control (IPC) comprised of a bacteriophage MS2 that
is included in the Liat Assay Tube. The IPC is used to monitor specimen processing,
amplification, detection and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the RT-PCR reactions.
External Positive and Negative controls are included with cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza
A/B Quality Control Kit. The cobas SARS-CoV-2 Positive Control is a plasmid containing
SARS-CoV-2 sequences in a buffer solution, that is used to rehydrate the cobas Influenza
A/B Positive control lyophilized beads. The cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B Quality
control kit also include cobas Dilution UTM as the negative control. External Controls are
run during the Add cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B Tube Lot procedure.
Additional External Controls should be tested in accordance with local, state, federal and/or
accrediting organization requirements as applicable. The external controls were validated in
the analytical, clinical, and flex studies.

VII Performance Characteristics:
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted assessing the total variability of the cobas Liat SARS-
CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay across operators, study sites, testing days, cobas Liat
Analyzers, and cobas Liat assay tube lots. The cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B
assay was evaluated at three CLIA waived sites. Two (2) operators at each of the three sites
tested a 3-member reproducibility panel in triplicate on five different days across 3 reagent
lots, for a total of ~810 tests, ~270 tests/panel member (3 sites × 3 lots/site × 5 day/lot × 2
operators/day × 3 panel members/operator × 3 replicates/panel member). Each site utilized a
minimum of three Liat Analyzers. The reproducibility panel contained a true negative; a low
positive and a moderate positive member co-formulated with SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and
influenza B.
The reproducibility panel samples were prepared by spiking SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020,
catalog number 0810587CFHI, ZeptoMetrix, NY, USA), influenza A virus (Brisbane/59/07-
catalog number 0810244CF; ZeptoMetrix, NY, USA) and influenza B virus (Florida/04/06-
catalog number 0810255CF; ZeptoMetrix, NY, USA) of known titer into negative simulated
clinical matrix (Equivalency between NPS matrix, NS matrix and simulated clinical matrix
was demonstrated in a matrix equivalency study, refer to section VII.B.2.) The moderate
positive and low positive concentrations used for each of the strains corresponded to 3x-5x
LoD and 1x-2x LoD, respectively. The true negative sample was comprised of negative
simulated clinical matrix.
Three (3) CLIA waived sites and six operators (two operators per site) participated in this
reproducibility study. The six operators consisted of two Medical Assistants, a Point-of-Care
Coordinator, a Research assistant, an Administrative assistant (billing), and a Lab Technician
(institutional title only, no laboratory training) with no formal medical laboratory training.
All operators had limited or no training or hands-on experience in conducting laboratory
testing when the study initiated.
The six operators at the three sites tested the members of the reproducibility panel in
triplicate on five non-consecutive days. Three (3) cobas Liat Analyzers were used at each site
for a total of nine cobas Liat Analyzers. Each site also used approximately equal amounts of
three different lots of cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay tubes.
The reproducibility study results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

The cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay demonstrated 100% agreement for Flu
A, and 99.6% agreement for SARS-CoV-2 and Flu B moderate positive panel members. For
low positive panel members, the assay yielded 100% agreement for Flu B, and 98.9% and
98.5% for SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A, respectively (Table 1 above). A lower agreement for low
positive panel members was expected, since the analyte concentration of their panel member
analytes ranged between 1x and 2x the limit of detection, which is expected to yield >95%
detection rate. This performance is acceptable and demonstrates acceptable assay
reproducibility.

an is the number of positive tests, which contribute Ct values to the analysis. N is the total number of valid tests for the panel member.
bThe Mean and total SD were estimated using the PROC MIXED procedure.
cTotal CV(%) = (SD/Mean)*100.
The total Ct variability, as measured by the standard deviation, was less than or equal to 1.08
across all target viruses and concentrations. For all positive panel members, the within-run
factor (i.e., random error) was the largest contributor to total variability. These results
indicate that the reproducibility of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay on the Liat
system is robust in NPS samples.

Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
a. In silico
The inclusivity of the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay was evaluated
using in silico analysis of the forward primers, reverse primers, and probes for the
SARS-CoV-2, Flu A and Flu B target systems in relation to sequences available in the
NCBI and GISAID gene databases. For SARS-CoV-2, all available sequences up to
March 15, 2023, from the GISAID (>14.3 million sequences) and NCBI (>6.5 million
sequences) gene databases were evaluated. For Flu A and Flu B, available sequences
from GISAID gene databases as of January 26, 2023, were evaluated. In total, >20
million SARS-CoV-2 and approximatley180 thousand Flu A sequences and
approximately 38 thousand H1N1pdm09 sequences were assessed. The SARS-CoV-2
sequences included the following lineages and variants of concern (VOC) or variants
of interest (VOI) that may have important epidemiological, immunological, or
pathogenic properties from a public health perspective: Delta, Alpha, Omicron BA.1,
Omicron BA.2, Omicron BA.4, Omicron BA.5, Omicron BQ.1, Omicron BQ.1.1,
Omicron BF.7, Gamma, Epsilon, Iota, Beta, Mu, Zeta, Kappa, Eta, Lamba, and Theta.
Based on the in silico analysis of GISAID and NCBI sequences available up to March
15, 2023 for SARS-CoV-2, only two sequences in GISAID (0.00001%) have the
changes that were predicted to affect detection and performance of the test, and they
were deposited prior to July 2022 and were likely sequencing errors due to low
sequence quality. Therefore, the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay is
predicted to detect all 20,972,883 SARS-CoV-2 sequences evaluated.
Based on in silico analysis of all sequences available from January 26, 2023, to in
GISAID database, the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay is predicted to

mutations and the WHO recommended vaccine strains for 2023-2024).
b. Wet-Testing
This study was performed to determine the analytical reactivity of the cobas Liat SARS-
CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay with clinically relevant strains of SARS-CoV-2. The
inclusivity panel was prepared by spiking various inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral strains
into pooled negative clinical matrix at concentration at, below, and above LoD and
testing in triplicate. The strains evaluated and the lowest concentration that achieved
100% reactivity are shown in Table 3, below.

inclusive. The tested influenza A strains included 14 influenza A/H1 strains (including 3
H1N1 pdm09 strains), 12 influenza A/H3 strains (including 1 H3N2 strain), 1 influenza
A/H7N9 strain and 1 influenza A/H5N1 reassortant strain. The tested influenza B strains

Cross-Reactivity/Microbial Interference
Wet- Testing
This study evaluated the analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) and sensitivity of the
cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B for use on the cobas Liat System in the presence of
non-targeted microorganisms that may be found in a respiratory tract clinical specimen.
Forty-two (42) non-target microorganisms (Table 4) were evaluated in the study. Panel
members were composed of one non-target microorganism spiked into negative clinical
NP swab matrix at approximately 1.0E+05 units/mL for viruses and approximately
1.0E+06 unit/mL for bacteria and fungi (Units/mL: EB/mL, CFU/mL, IU/mL,

/mL, particles/mL, copies/mL, or PFU/mL), except for Pneumocystis jirovecii,
which was tested at 5.0E+03 units/mL and was a positive clinical sample diluted 1:10 in
negative NP clinical matrix. To evaluate cross-reactivity, each panel was tested once in
the absence of the target organisms. To evaluate microbial interference (negative effect
on sensitivity), each panel was tested once in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-
WA1/2020), Flu A H1N1 (Brisbane 59/07), and Flu B (Florida/04/06) at 3x LoD. No
cross-reactivity or microbial interference was observed except for SARS-CoV-1, which
at a concentration of 1x105 PFU/mL inhibited detection of SARS-CoV-2 (at 3x LoD).
SARS-CoV-1 no longer inhibited detection of SARS-CoV-2 when SARS-CoV-1 was
diluted and tested at a concentration of 1x104 PFU/mL.

Interfering Substances
This study evaluated the performance of the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B test in the
presence of medications, over the counter products, and other potentially interfering substances
found in a clinical respiratory specimen. Assay results were evaluated to determine if the presence
of potentially interfering substances in target analyte negative or target analyte positive samples
had an effect on assay performance. The analyte negative pools contained negative NPS in UTM
clinical matrix and the potentially interfering substances, only. The analyte positive pools
contained negative NPS in UTM clinical matrix, the potentially interfering substance(s), and one
representative strain of each targeted analyte (i.e., SARS-CoV-2, Flu A and Flu B) spiked to a
final testing concentration of 3x LoD. Three replicates were tested per pool both in the presence
and absence of the target analytes. The substances evaluated are denoted in Table 5 below. All
target-spiked panels were 100% positive, and all target-negative panels were 100% negative,
indicating that none of the evaluated substances interfered with the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 &
Influenza A/B test.

fixed at concentrations that produced Ct values of 15 and 16, respectively, which are
frequently observed in positive clinical specimens. The low concentration target virus was

• Specimens transferred into the cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B Assy tube
may be stored up to 4 hours at room temperature (15-30°C).
c. Kit Stability
Stability of the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay tubes and cobas Liat
SARS-CoV-2 Positive Control were evaluated in real time. Stability of cobas Liat Flu
A/B Positive Control and cobas Liat Dilution UTM (negative control) were not assessed,
as stability for these reagents has been previously established for cobas Liat Influenza
A/B & RSV (K153544). The study data supports the claimed storage conditions for the
cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay tubes and cobas Liat SARS-Cov-2
Positive Control.
Shipping Stability
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that exposure to extreme hot or cold
temperatures potentially encountered by the cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay
tubes during shipment would not impact the performance of the assay. Three pilot lots of
assay tube for the cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay were tested in this study.
The cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay tubes were stored at conditions
representing the upper and lower limits of Category F classified kits (i.e., 37°C and -20°C).
Assay tubes were stored at 37°C for 14 days and -20°C for 7 days. Five positive replicates
per lot were prepared with cobas SARS-CoV-2 Positive Control and cobas Influenza A/B
Positive control and tested along with one replicate of cobas Liat Dilution UTM (negative
control), for a total of 18 tests performed for each time point.
All runs tested gave the expected results for all positive and negative replicates. This
study demonstrates that cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay tubes are not altered
by exposure to extreme hot or cold temperatures that may be encountered during
shipping.
6. Detection Limit:
a. SARS-CoV-2
To determine the LoD for the SARS-CoV-2 targets, heat inactivated cultured SARS-CoV-2
virus (USA-WA1/2020, catalog number 0810587CFHI, ZeptoMetrix, NY, USA) was serially
diluted in pooled negative clinical nasopharyngeal swab matrix (NNPS). Five concentration
levels of a 2-fold serial dilution series, were tested with 20 replicates per concentration
except for the highest concentration level, where only 10 replicates were tested. Three Pilot
lots of Assay tubes (approximately equal number of replicates per lot), 20 cobas Liat
analyzers (4-5 runs per analyzer) and two independent dilution series (equal number of
replicates per dilution series) were used in the study. The LoD, or the lowest concentration
which yielded a positive rate of ≥95%, was determined to be 0.012 TCID /mL (12
50
copies/mL). Of note, only one LoD is reported for the SARS-CoV-2 N gene and RdRp
targets, as both are labeled with the same fluorophore and therefore indistinguishable from
one another. The results of the SARS-CoV-2 LoD study are summarized in Table 9.

Note: Concentration of viral stock in copies/mL was quantified using reverse transcriptase digital PCR with target
specific PCR primers and probe sets designed to amplify SARS-CoV-2
b. WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2
The LoD using WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (NIBSC code: 20/146)
was determined by reconstituting the WHO Standard to 0.5 mL according to the WHO
NIBSC code: 20/146 Instructions for use (Version 1.0, Dated 14-Dec-2020). Following
reconstitution, the WHO Standard was diluted to an intermediate stock (IS) concentration in
UTM.
WHO International Standard was serially diluted in pooled negative nasopharyngeal swabs
matrix. Five concentration levels were tested with 24 replicates at each level across three lots
of assay tubes (8 replicates per lot). Three independent dilution series were used in the study
with an approximately equal numbers of replicates per dilution series. The LoD, or the lowest
concentration which yielded a positive rate of ≥95%, was determined to be 62.5 IU/mL.
The results of the detection rate and LoD are shown in Table 10 below.

c. Influenza A/B
The detection limit for influenza A and B was established in the original cleared cobas
Influenza A/B & RSV Test for use with the Liat System (K153544). The Limit of Detection
(LoD) was evaluated using 3 strains of influenza A and 2 strains of influenza B. The LoD
was determined by limiting dilution studies using these titered viruses. The viruses were
spiked into negative nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) in UTM sample matrix. The LoD was
determined to be 2×10-3 - 2×10-2 TCID /mL for influenza A strains, and 2×10-3 - 4×10-3
50
TCID /mL for influenza B strains. The LoD results for influenza A and B are summarized in

catalog number 0810587CFHI, ZeptoMetrix, NY, USA) was also evaluated with cobas
SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B for the Liat System and shown to be equivalent to single
analyte spiked samples.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
A target result call is determined individually for each target (SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A,
Influenza B) channel and the internal process control channel based on the combination of:
Ct, Amplitude (AMP), and other validity features. A final result is determined for the targets
based on the combination of the target result call, internal process control result call, curve
validity (including Ct and Amplitude cutoffs), and the sample input volume. The sample
input volume is determined to be low when sample input is less than the defined minimum
volume requirements. Only the SARS-CoV-2 target channel uses Amp as a part of the result
evaluation to allow a better margin for specificity.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not Applicable
9. Carry-Over:
A carry-over study was conducted for the original cleared cobas Influenza A/B & RSV test
for the Liat System (K153544) and demonstrated that there was no carry-over or cross
contamination observed. The cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B for the Liat System
instrumentation and workflow are identical to the cobas Influenza A/B & RSV for the Liat
System, therefore additional carry-over studies are not required.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not applicable.
2. Matrix Comparison:
Some analytical studies were conducted using simulated matrix, therefore equivalency
between simulated and real clinical matrix was evaluated. The simulated matrix consisted of
2.5 mg/mL mucin and 250,000 HCT-15 cells/mL in UTM. Matrix equivalency was
evaluated by spiking cultured SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020, catalog number
0810587CFHI, ZeptoMetrix, NY, USA), influenza A (Brisbane/59/07, catalog number
0810244CF, ZeptoMetrix, NY, USA), and influenza B (Florida/04/06, catalog number

natural nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and nasal swab (NS) in UTM at 0x (negative samples),
2x and 5x LoD (approximately). For simulated matrix, 10 replicates of negative samples, 30
replicates of positive samples at ~2x LoD and 10 replicates of positive samples at ~5x LoD
were tested. For natural NPS and NS matrix in UTM, the same number of replicates and
concentrations as SIM were tested but divided equally between NPS and NS matrices. One
lot of Assay tubes and 10 cobas Liat analyzers (equal number of replicates per analyzer) were
used in the study. The acceptance criteria to demonstrate equivalency was 0% detection for
negative samples, ≥95% detection for positive samples at 2x LoD and 100% detection for
positive samples at 5x LoD for each target.
Negative sample testing showed 0% positive detection rate for all targets in all matrices, 5x
LoD sample showed 100% detection rate for all targets in all matrices, and 2x LoD sample
testing showed 100% detection rate for both simulated matrix and natural clinical specimen
(NPS/NS) matrix for influenza A and influenza B. A 97% detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 at
2x LoD was observed in both simulated matrix and clinical specimen (NPS/NS) matrix.
There was no difference in detection rates between simulated clinical matrix and NPS & NS
clinical UTM matrix, therefore the study acceptance criteria were met. The results of the
matrix equivalency study are summarized in Table 12.

Collection media equivalency was evaluated by spiking cultured SARS-CoV-2 (USA-
WA1/2020, catalog number 0810587CFHI-0.5mL, ZeptoMetrix, NY, USA), influenza A
(Brisbane/59/07, catalog number 0810244CF, ZeptoMetrix, NY, USA), and influenza B
(Florida/04/06, catalog number 0810255CF; ZeptoMetrix, NY, USA) viruses at 0x (negative
samples), 2x and 5x LoD into negative nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) collected in UTM,
M4RT and Saline (0.9% NaCl). For each collection media type, 10 replicates of negative
samples, 30 replicates of positive samples at 2x LoD and 10 replicates of positive samples at
5x LoD were tested. One lot of Assay tubes and 15 cobas Liat analyzers (approximately
equal number of replicates per analyzer) were used in the study. The acceptance criteria to
demonstrate equivalency was 0% detection for negative samples, ≥95% detection for positive
samples at 2x LoD and 100% detection for positive samples at 5x LoD for each target.
Negative sample testing showed 0% detection rate for all targets in all collection media
types. 5x LoD sample testing showed 100% detection rate for all targets for UTM, M4RT,
and Saline. 2x LoD sample testing showed 100% detection rate for UTM, M4RT and Saline
for all targets, except for influenza A. At 2x LoD in saline, influenza A generated a 97%
detection rate with 29 out of 30 samples being detected. All levels for all targets met the
study acceptance criteria for detection rate. Additionally, there was no statistical difference
observed between UTM & M4RT or between UTM & SAL detection rate proportions. The
results of the media equivalency study are summarized in Table 13.

The results showed that the assay was able to correctly detect the presence of the viral targets
suspended in all collection media types demonstrating that UTM, M4RT, and 0.9% saline
media are acceptable collection and transport media for use with the cobas SARS-CoV-2 &
Influenza A/B for use on the cobas Liat System.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B test for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B was separately evaluated using unpaired
retrospective and paired prospective clinical NPS and NS samples collected from individuals
with signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection. Testing of clinical samples was
performed with the cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B for use on the Liat System at 10
point-of-care healthcare facilities (e.g., emergency rooms, outpatient clinics, and physician
offices). For the SARS-CoV-2 target, results from cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B
were compared to results from three highly sensitive FDA-authorized laboratory-based RT-
PCR EUA assays (composite comparator method). For influenza A/B targets, results from
cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B were compared to results from an acceptable molecular
assay for influenza (comparator method).
Prospective Study:
Prospective clinical specimens were collected and tested from February–June 2022. In total,
prospectively collected paired NPS and NS specimens from 640 evaluable individuals were
included in the analysis population for the evaluation of cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 &
Influenza A/B. Of these, 24 NPS and 24 NS samples were excluded or non-evaluable. For
NPS, 13 NPS specimens had no comparator results due to incidents (11) or were missing or
not tested (2), and 11 NPS specimen results from cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B
were non-evaluable due to protocol deviation (8), not tested (1), or invalid results (2). For
NS, 11 NS specimens had no comparator results due to incidents (9) or were missing/not
tested (2), and 13 NS specimen results from cobas Lait SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B were
non-evaluable due to protocol deviation (8) or invalid results (5). The remaining 616
prospective NPS and NS samples were included for analysis. Table 14 below provides a
summary of the demographic information for the 640 subjects enrolled in the clinical study.

a A clinical site that was a mobile drive-through site was not able to collect race/ethnicity identification from
subjects.
No coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B were detected by the comparator
methods or the candidate device. No prospective specimens tested in this performance
evaluation were influenza B positive by the comparator method.
As shown in Table 15 for prospective symptomatic subjects, 101 NPS specimens tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 with both the cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B test on cobas
Liat System and the composite comparator; five SARS-CoV-2 composite comparator
positive specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 with the cobas SARS-CoV-2 &
Influenza A/B test. A total of 507 NPS specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 with both
the cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B test and the composite comparator; three SARS-
CoV-2 composite comparator negative specimens tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with the
cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B test. All discordant SARS-CoV-2 results showed late
Ct values, which are indicative of NPS specimens from individuals with viral loads near or
below the limit of detection of both cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B and the composite
comparator methods.
For SARS-CoV-2, the results of the clinical performance evaluation using NPS specimens
from prospective symptomatic subjects demonstrated 95.3% positive percent agreement
(PPA) (101/106; 95% score CI: 89.4% - 98.0%) and 99.4% negative percent agreement
(NPA) (507/510; 95% score CI: 98.3% - 99.8%) as compared to the composite comparator
method.

performance evaluation using NS specimens from prospective symptomatic subjects
demonstrated 100.0% NPA (616/616; 95% score CI: 99.4% - 100.0%) as compared to the
comparator method.
Retrospective Study:
To supplement the prospective data for influenza A and influenza B, retrospective frozen
positive and negative NPS (n=178) and NS (n=190) specimens prospectively obtained during
the 2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2019-2020 flu seasons and during the COVID-19 pandemic
(March–June 2021) were distributed to 4 of the 10 sites and worked into the daily workflow
of sites for testing. Subject demographic data was not available for the retrospective samples.
Of the178 retrospective NPS specimens (44 influenza A positive, 22 influenza B-positive,
and 112 negative) that were tested at sites, two retrospective NPS samples were non-
evaluable due to obtaining invalid results from the comparator device, and three obtained
invalid results for influenza B with the candidate device, leaving 176 evaluable retrospective
NPS samples for influenza A and 173 for influenza B. Of the 190 retrospective NS
specimens (37 influenza A-positive, 35 influenza B-positive, and 118 negative) that were
tested at sites, three retrospective NS samples were non-evaluable due to obtaining invalid
results from the comparator device, and one was aborted by the candidate device, leaving 186
evaluable retrospective NS samples for influenza A and influenza B.
As shown in Table 19 for retrospective NPS specimens, the results of the clinical
performance evaluation for influenza A demonstrated 97.7% PPA (43/44; 95% score CI:
88.2% - 99.6%) and 99.2% NPA (131/132; 95% score CI: 95.8% – 99.9%) as compared to

Note: This table includes both prospective and retrospective sample results.
Note: A quality control (QC) batch is defined as the set of external control runs (typically 1 SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B–
Positive and 1 SARS-CoV-2 Influenza A/B- Negative).
Note: An invalid QC batch is one where at least one external control is invalid or was not performed or there is an incident or
protocol deviation that invalidates the entire QC batch.
{a} A failed QC batch is one where a failed test occurred for at least one of the external controls (SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza
A/B-Positive or SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B-Negative external control) and the external control was not retested.
{b} Other incidents include: reagent, operational and other errors.

Note: This table includes both prospective and retrospective sample results.
Note: A quality control (QC) batch is defined as the set of external control runs (typically 1 SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B–
Positive and 1 SARS-CoV-2 Influenza A/B- Negative).
Note: An invalid QC batch is one where at least one external control is invalid or was not performed or there is an incident or
protocol deviation that invalidates the entire QC batch.
{a} A failed QC batch is one where a failed test occurred for at least one of the external controls (SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza
A/B-Positive or SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B-Negative external control) and the external control was not retested.
{b} Other incidents include: reagent, operational and other errors.

For the prospective clinical performance evaluation of cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B,
paired NPS and NS specimens from 640 evaluable subjects, including 616 evaluable results,
were freshly collected and tested at 10 point-of-care clinical sites in the United States during
February–June 2022. Expected value (as determined by cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B)
summaries for prospective specimens, stratified by specimen collection/testing site are presented
for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A targets in Table 25 and Table 26, respectively.
No prospective fresh specimens tested in this performance evaluation were influenza B positive
by either cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B or comparator test methods.
