III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The TBI test is a panel of in vitro diagnostic chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays
(CMIA) used for the quantitative measurements of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and
ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) in human plasma and serum and provides a
semi-quantitative interpretation of test results derived from these measurements using the Alinity
i system.
The interpretation of test results is used, in conjunction with other clinical information, to aid in
the evaluation of patients, 18 years of age or older, presenting with suspected mild traumatic
brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score 13-15) within 12 hours of injury, to assist in
determining the need for a CT (computed tomography) scan of the head. A negative test result is
associated with the absence of acute intracranial lesions visualized on a head CT scan.
The TBI test is intended for use in clinical laboratory settings by healthcare professionals.

B Principle of Operation:
The TBI test is a panel of in vitro diagnostic quantitative measurements of GFAP and UCH-L1 in
human plasma and serum using an automated, two-step chemiluminescent microparticle
immunoassay (CMIA) on the Alinity i system, and provides a semi-quantitative interpretation
based on the results of GFAP and UCH-L1.
For GFAP, sample, anti-GFAP coated paramagnetic microparticles, and assay specific diluent
are combined and incubated. The GFAP present in the sample binds to the anti-GFAP coated
microparticles. The mixture is washed. Anti-GFAP acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to
create a reaction mixture and incubated. Following a wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger
Solutions are added. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit
(RLU). There is a direct relationship between the amount of GFAP in the sample and the RLU
detected by the system optics.
For UCH-L1, sample, anti-UCH-L1 coated paramagnetic microparticles, and assay specific
diluent are combined and incubated. The UCH-L1 present in the sample binds to the anti-UCH-
L1 coated microparticles. The mixture is washed. Anti-UCH-L1 acridinium-labeled conjugate is
added to create a reaction mixture and incubated. Following a wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and
Trigger Solutions are added. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as an RLU.
K223602 - Page 3 of 28

--- Page 4 ---
There is a direct relationship between the amount of UCH-L1 in the sample and the RLU
detected by the system optics.
The assay cut-offs were established to be 35.0 pg/mL (35.0 ng/L) for GFAP and 400.0 pg/mL
(400.0 ng/L) for UCH-L1. The GFAP and UCH-L1 results are reported separately, and the
Alinity i system software provides a TBI interpretation relative to the respective cut-off values as
shown in the following table.

* Above means greater than or equal to the cut-off. Below means less than the cut-off.
** The GFAP and UCH-L1 results can be found on the Result Details screen under Constituent
Information on the User Interface.
*** An automated TBI interpretation will not be reported for specimens without a result for
GFAP and/or UCH-L1. The GFAP and/or UCH-L1 assay(s) may be retested if needed to
obtain a result and a manual TBI interpretation may be required. The TBI interpretation for
a specimen is considered positive if the result for either constituent assay (GFAP or UCH-
L1) is greater than or equal to the cut-off and no result is obtained for the other assay. The
TBI interpretation for a specimen is not reportable if the result for either constituent assay is
less than the cut-off and no result is obtained for the other assay.
In the case of a flagged ">" or "<" result for either assay, the TBI interpretation should be
evaluated manually. A result flagged “>” should be considered above the cut-off and a result
flagged “<” should be considered below the cut-off.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
All results met the manufacturer's pre-determined acceptance criteria.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a. Within-laboratory precision
A study was conducted per CLSI guideline EP05-A3 to evaluate the within-laboratory
precision of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays.
K2 EDTA human plasma samples in the test panels were prepared to achieve target
concentrations of GFAP and UCH-L1 that cover the respective measuring ranges of the
individual assays and tested at one site using two reagent lots of each assay and two
Alinity i instruments. The panel consisted of a native plasma sample near the assay cut-
off (panel member 2) and pooled plasma samples (panel members 1 and 3–8) spiked with
recombinant analytes (< 0.02% of sample volume). The panel members were tested along
with three controls in three replicates in two runs per day for 20 days (3 x 2 x 20 =120
replicates per reagent lot/instrument combination) on the four reagent lot/instrument
combinations to generate a total of 480 replicates per test panel (i.e., N=120 for lot
1/instrument 1 combination, N=120 for lot 2/instrument 1 combination, N=120 for lot
2/instrument 1 combination, and N=120 for lot 2/instrument 2 combination). The
performance across the four reagent lots/instrument combinations were analyzed.
In addition, the qualitative analysis of precision results relative to the cut-offs (35.0
pg/mL for GFAP and 400 pg/mL for UCH-L1) was performed using the same 20-day
within-laboratory precision study data. The % correct call was calculated for each plasma
sample and was based on the number of replicates providing the expected GFAP / UCH-
L1 results (Not Elevated or Elevated) based on the mean analyte concentration for the
sample (either below cut-off or at/above cut-off, respectively).
Results are summarized in the tables below for each assay.

b. Multi-site reproducibility
A study was conducted per CLSI guideline EP05-A3 to evaluate the multi-site
reproducibility precision of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays. Two separate test panels,
each consisting of seven human K2 EDTA plasma samples with levels of GFAP or UCH-
L1 that cover the measuring range of the respective assays, were tested along with three
controls. The panel included one native sample near the assay cut-off (panel member 2)
and pooled plasma samples (panel members 1 and 3–7) spiked with recombinant
analytes. Each sample was tested in four replicates per run, two runs per day, for five
days at three sites in the U.S. with one instrument at each site, using three reagent lots to
generate a total of 360 replicates (i.e., 4 x 2 x 5 x 3 x 3).
The quantitative and qualitative analysis were conducted as described above. Results are
summarized in the tables below for each assay.

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the GFAP and UCH-Ll assays on the Alinity i system was evaluated in
accordance with the CLSI guideline EP6 2nd Edition. Two studies for each assay were
conducted in parallel and the data from the studies were analyzed for evaluating linearity for
each assay.
a. GFAP
The linear range of the GFAP assay was established using a native human plasma sample
set and three recombinant GFAP sample sets. One unique native sample set was prepared
using a native high K2 EDTA plasma combined with analyte-depleted plasma to create a
series of 10 dilutions with GFAP concentrations spanning from 3.8 to 23868.7 pg/mL.
Each sample dilution was tested in five replicates using one reagent lot. Three
recombinant sample sets (A, B, and C) were prepared using a high recombinant GFAP
stock diluted with three unique sets of analyte-depleted plasma to create a series of
dilutions with GFAP concentrations spanning from 5.2 to 53720.5 pg/mL for set A, from
4.8 to 49245.4 pg/mL for set B, and from 5.1 to 42556.9 pg/mL for set C. Each
recombinant sample set consisted of at least nine dilutions, each tested in ten replicates.
Deviations from linearity were calculated for the pooled results of the native human
plasma sample set and each recombinant sample set individually (i.e., native set and
recombinant set A, native set and recombinant set B, and native set and recombinant set
C). The representative deviation from linearity analysis using the native set and
recombinant set A is shown in the table below.

The study demonstrated linearity across a series of dilutions spanning an interval of 3.8 to
42,556.9 pg/mL. The claimed linearity of the GFAP assay is 6.1 to 42,000.0 pg/mL based
on the pooled analysis of native and non-native samples.
b. UCH-L1
The linear range of the UCH-L1 assay was established using a native human plasma
sample set. One unique sample set was prepared using a native high K2 EDTA plasma
combined with analyte-depleted plasma to create a series of 10 dilutions of UCH-L1
concentrations that span across the analytical measuring interval of the assay. Each
sample dilution was tested in five replicates using one reagent lot. For each sample, the
mean value of the measured values, predicted value and the deviation from linearity were
calculated.

The study demonstrated linearity across a series of dilutions produced with a native
specimen and spanning an interval of 10.1 to 28,235.1 pg/mL. The claimed linearity of
the UCH-L1 assay is 26.3 to 25,000 pg/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a. Interference
Assay interference was assessed in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP07-3rd Edition
by testing pooled human plasma spiked with either recombinant GFAP at final
concentrations of 25 and 10,000 pg/mL or recombinant UCH-L1 at final concentrations
of 280 pg/mL and 5000 pg/mL. Test samples were created by spiking with the potentially
interfering substances. Control samples were spiked only with the appropriate solvent
used to create the interfering substances panel. Test and control samples were analyzed in
replicates of five, in one assay run, with one reagent lot of each assay on the Alinity i
system. The %Interference of each analyte was calculated by determining the percent
difference between the test and control samples: %Interference = [(Mean – Mean )/
test control
Mean ] x 100%. No significant interference was observed (≤10% difference from the
control
control sample) for the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays up to the concentrations of the
endogenous and exogenous substances tested as shown in the tables below:

b. Cross-reactivity
To assess test performance in the presence of putative cross-reactants, a panel comprised
of proteins that have significant homology to either GFAP or UCH-L1 was evaluated.
Samples containing the cross-reactants at the concentrations listed in the table below
were prepared in GFAP-depleted plasma or UCH-L1 depleted plasma and tested with the
GFAP and UCH-L1 assays on the Alinity i system in 30 replicates. The % cross-
reactivity was calculated, and the results showed none of the potentially cross-reactants
tested were found to interfere with the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays.

c. Carryover / cross-contamination
A study was conducted to evaluate if cross-contamination and/or carryover occurs
between samples during the assay procedure by comparing the result of a protected low
sample (analyte-depleted pooled plasma sample before a high sample) to that of an
unprotected low sample (analyte-depleted pooled plasma sample after a high sample).
The high sample was a pooled plasma sample spiked with recombinant GFAP analyte
stock targeted to greater than or equal to 500,000 pg/mL and UCH-L1 analyte stock
targeted to greater than or equal to 100,000 pg/mL. There were four testing steps (wash
buffer – protected low sample – high sample – unprotected) in each testing iteration and
the cycle of the four testing steps was repeated for a total of 27 iterations across five runs
on the Alinity i system. No sample carryover was observed and the GFAP and UCH-L1
assays are not susceptible to sample carryover.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The analytical measuring internal (AMI) is 6.1–42,000 pg/mL for GFAP and 26.3–25,000
pg/mL for UCH-L1.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The GFAP and UCH-L1 Calibrators are manufactured gravimetrically and are referenced to
an internal reference standard at each concentration level. The internal reference standards
are stored frozen at ≤ -70°C. The GFAP and UCH-L1 Controls are traceable to an internal
reference standard at each concentration level.
Stability
a. Sample storage stability
A study was performed to evaluate serum and plasma specimens when subjected to
various storage conditions (-28 to -20°C, 2 to 8°C, and 15 to 25°C) and tested with the
GFAP and UCH-L1 assays. Native specimens spanning the respective AMI of each assay
were collected from patients with suspected TBI in either K2 EDTA or serum separator
tubes and tested in two or three replicates to determine sample storage stability. For the
on-the-cell storage conditions, testing was performed directly from the blood collection
tubes. For the off-the-cell storage conditions, multiple collection tubes were obtained
from each subject and their respective serum or plasma was pooled prior to baseline
testing. Sample storage stability was evaluated individually for the K2 EDTA or the
serum separator tube type. The results support the use of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays
when testing serum and plasma specimens that have been stored at the following
conditions:
• room temperature (15 to 25°C): up to 8 hours on and off-the-cells
• 2 to 8°C: up to 8 hours on-the-cells/clot/gel and up to 7 days off-the-cells/clot/gel
K223602 - Page 17 of 28

--- Page 18 ---
• -28 to -20°C: up to 1 month off-the-cells/clot/gel with up to 1 freeze/thaw cycle
The TBI Package Insert ‘Limitations of the Procedure’ states ‘Avoid more than 1
freeze/thaw cycle’.
b. On-board sample stability
A study was performed to evaluate the stability of the samples when stored on the Alinity
i system and tested with the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays using two levels of samples
(GFAP at 25 and 10,000 pg/mL, UCH-L1 at 280 and 5000 pg/mL). Minimum sample
volume was 200 μL for the GFAP assay and 150 μL for the UCH-L1 assay. Samples may
be stored on the Alinity i system for up to 2 hours.
c. Assay kit stability
An assay kit stability study was performed using a real-time stability study design in
accordance with the CLSI guideline EP25-A. Three lots of each GFAP and UCH-L1
assay kit were stored at 2 to 8°C for the evaluation of real-time stability. An additional lot
of each GFAP and UCH-L1 assay kit was opened and stored in the Alinity i system for
the evaluation of on-board stability. Plasma samples at three analyte levels for each
GFAP (~11, ~43, and ~ 26,000 pg/mL) and UCH-L1 (~90, ~400, and ~15,000 pg/mL)
were tested in a minimum of 10 replicates at each testing time point from the baseline
time point (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 months for real-time stability; at
0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 13 months for on-board stability). The data from the stability
study support expiration dating up to 12 months at 2 to 8°C and 30 days on-board.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
studies were conducted in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A2. The studies
evaluated three reagents lots of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays on each of two Alinity i
systems. A description of each study and the results obtained are summarized below:
The LoB was determined as the 95th percentile of measurements from 120 replicates of four
analyte-depleted pooled human plasma samples that were each tested in five replicates for
three days in two instruments per lot. The highest observed LoB of the three lots was 1.6
pg/mL for GFAP and 6.1 pg/mL for UCH-L1. The claimed LoB is 1.6 pg/mL for GFAP and
6.1 pg/mL for UCH-L1.
For determination of LoD, five plasma samples with low GFAP concentrations ranged 1.6 to
8.8 pg/mL and six plasma samples with low UCH-L1 concentrations ranged 10.1 to 50.7
pg/mL were measured in 20 replicates in a run per day over three days in two instruments for
a total of 120 replicates per lot (60 replicates per lot / instrument) for each sample. The
highest observed GFAP LoD was 2.2 pg/mL of three lots. The highest observed UCH-L1
LoD was 16.1 pg/mL of three lots. The claimed LoD is 3.2 pg/mL for GFAP and 18.3 pg/mL
for UCH-L1.

The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which a maximum allowable precision
of 20.0 %CV and determined from 120 replicates per lot (60 replicates per lot / instrument)
for each low-analyte level sample. The highest observed GFAP LoQ was 2.4 pg/mL. The
highest observed UCH-L1 LoQ was 16.1 pg/mL of three lots. The claimed LoQ is 6.1 pg/mL
for GFAP and 26.3 pg/mL for UCH-L1.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The GFAP and UCH-L1 assay cut-offs were determined by analyzing a training dataset from
a completely independent study population that is distinct from subjects evaluated in the
pivotal study to validate the assay cut-offs. Frozen EDTA plasma samples from two study
cohorts; ATO-04b (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01295346) and ATO-06x
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02439736) were utilized to establish the assay cut-offs. A
total of 354 subjects with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores between 13–15 who had blood
specimens collected within 12 hours from the time of suspected head injury, a head CT scan
determination, and were 18 years or older at the time of injury were included in the training
dataset. Of the 354 subjects, 37.3% (132/354) had a positive CT result. Using a 10-fold cross
validation and bootstrapping method, the optimal cut-off values were selected as 35 pg/mL
for the GFAP assay and 400 pg/mL for the UCH-L1 assay.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not applicable
2. Matrix Comparison:
Sample matrix equivalence was evaluated in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP35 1st ed
for samples collected with six different blood collection tube types: K2 EDTA, serum, serum
separator tube, K3 EDTA, lithium heparin, and lithium heparin separator tube. Samples
ranged across the AMI (45–47 contrived and 54–55 native samples per tube type for the
GFAP assay; 46 contrived and 53–54 native samples per tube type for the UCH-L1 assay)
and tested using one instrument and one reagent lot in duplicates for each sample. The test
results of the samples from each tube type (except K2 EDTA) were compared to the test
results of the samples from the primary tube type (K2 EDTA) ranged 12.8 to 41,121.0
pg/mL. A Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed using the primary tube (K2
EDTA) first replicate concentration compared to other tube type first replicate concentration
as summarized in the table below.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical performance with frozen plasma specimens from the ALERT-TBI study:
A pivotal study using archived (frozen) plasma specimens was conducted to evaluate the
clinical performance of the TBI test on the Alinity i system. The clinical specimens tested in
this study were previously collected by Banyan Biomarkers from subjects participating in
their study “A Prospective Clinical Evaluation of Biomarkers of Traumatic Brain Injury”
(ALERT-TBI, protocol ATO-06). The ALERT-TBI study enrolled subjects at 18 years of age
or older who presented to a health care facility (HCF) or emergency department (ED) with
head injuries and had a blood drawn within 12 hours of head injury and a standard of care
computed tomography (CT) scan of the head. Subjects were enrolled at 22 clinical sites in
three countries: United States (U.S.), Germany, and Hungary.
Under the ALERT-TBI study protocol, CT scans were performed in accordance with the
clinical site’s standard of care and a subject’s CT scan was classified as positive if
intracranial lesions were present. The standard of care head CT scans was previously
classified as positive or negative for intracranial lesions as part of the ALERT-TBI study.

Of the 1994 subjects enrolled in the ALERT-TBI study with GCS scores of 13 to 15, 72
subjects (3.6%, 72/1994) were not included in the clinical performance study due to lack of
consent for future testing, withdrawn consent, and no specimen available. Specimens from 23
subjects (1.2%, 23/1994) were not included in the analysis due to unreadable, inconclusive,
or no CT scan results; unknown time of blood draw or blood draw more than 12 hours after
injury; and/or no recorded time of injury. A total of 1899 frozen and de-identified K2 EDTA
plasma samples collected from these subjects were included in the clinical performance
evaluation. The plasma specimens were divided into aliquots and frozen in cryovials before
being provided to three testing sites in the U.S. Each specimen was associated with a
standard of care computed tomography (CT) scan of the head from the same study subject.

The most common head CT findings in the 120 subjects with CT-positive scans were scalp
injury (96.7%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (59.2%), the presence of incidental findings
(57.5%), and acute subdural hematoma (47.5%). Other frequently reported findings included
cranial fractures (26.7%), parenchymal hematoma (20.0%), facial fractures (16.7%), skull
based fractures (15.0%), and indeterminate extra-axial lesions (15.0%). All other findings
occurred in less than 10% of CT-positive subjects.
To estimate the clinical performance characteristics, the TBI test result was compared to the
adjudicated head CT scan result for each subject. The performance estimates are summarized
in the 2x2 table below. Of the 1899 subjects, 120 had positive CT scan results. Of these 120
subjects with positive CT scan results, 116 had a positive TBI test result (clinical sensitivity=
96.7%). The remaining four CT scan positive subjects had a negative TBI test result. The rate
of false negative (FN) results was 3.3% (4/120). Five subjects in the study were identified
with lesion requiring surgical intervention; none of these five subjects had a FN result,
suggesting that the TBI test correctly classified all these five CT-positive subjects with a
positive TBI test result. Of the 1779 subjects with negative CT scan results, 713 had a
negative TBI interpretation (clinical specificity=40.1%). The rate of false positive (FP)
results was 59.9% (1066/1779). Overall, there were 717 subjects with a negative TBI test
result. Of these, 713 specimens were associated with negative CT scan results. The negative
predictive value (NPV) of the assay was 99.4% (713/717). The potential benefit of the assay
would be a reduction in unnecessary CT scans by approximately 40.1% (713 of 1779
subjects had true negative assay results). The positive predictive value (PPV) of the assay
was 9.8% (116/1182). The Likelihood Ratio Negative (LRN) of the assay was 0.08. The
Likelihood Ratio positive (LRP) of the assay was 1.61.

Since specimens from the ALERT-TBI study were archived frozen samples, a specimen
stability study was conducted to demonstrate the integrity of clinical samples, as per special
control b(1)(ii)(i) of 21 CFR 866.5830. The study demonstrated stability of plasma samples
covering a range of GFAP and UCH-L1 analyte levels stored frozen at -70° C.
2. Clinical performance with fresh plasma samples:
To supplement the results of the pivotal study (N=1899) using archived (frozen) plasma
specimens from the ALERT-TBI described above, a prospective clinical validation study
(Protocol No CS-2018-0009: Clinical Evaluation of the i-STAT TBI Test study) was
conducted using freshly collected plasma specimens from consenting men and women 18

years of age or older who presented to a health care facility (HCF) or emergency department
(ED) with suspected mild TBI, with initial GCS scores of 13–15, and who had a CT scan of
the head performed. A total of 97 subjects were enrolled across five clinical sites in the
United States. Similar to the pivotal study, CT scans were performed in accordance with the
clinical site’s standard of care. CT adjudication was performed by an independent central
panel consisting of board-certified radiologists blinded to the TBI test results and each
other’s evaluation to determine the presence or absence of an acute intracranial lesion. The
intracranial lesions were defined as any trauma-induced or related finding visualized upon
head CT scan, and may have included acute epidural hematomas, acute subdural hematomas,
indeterminate extra-axial lesions, cortical contusions, parenchymal hematomas, non-
hemorrhagic contusions, ventricle compression, ventricular trapping, brain herniation,
intraventricular hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, subarachnoid hemorrhage, petechial
hemorrhage, global or focal brain edema and post traumatic ischemia. A head CT scan result
of a subject was classified as positive if intracranial lesions were present. Whole blood was
collected into K2 EDTA blood collection tubes from each subject using venipuncture and
centrifuged to obtain plasma. Specimens were collected within 12 hours of head injury. The
demographic characteristics of the subjects are presented in the table below:

a
NPV and PPV are estimated at 14.43% prevalence of CT scan positive rate for
suspected mild TBI subjects in the supplemental fresh plasma specimen study
cohort. If NPV and PPV are adjusted to 6% prevalence rate (comparable to the
pivotal study cohort), NPV = 99.2% (95% CI: 89.1 ̶ 99.9%), and PPV = 8.1
(95% CI: 7.2 ̶ 9.1%)
The results summarized in the table above show that the TBI test, when evaluated with fresh
plasma samples, is characterized by high sensitivity and NPV supportive of its clinical utility
as an aid in the evaluation of the need for a CT scan in subjects presenting with a GCS score
of 13 to 15 and a negative TBI test.

medical attention for head/neck/spine within the last one year, or active cancer / diagnosis within
the last 5 years. Frozen K2 EDTA plasma specimens stored for up to 5 months at -70℃ or colder
were tested with both the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays on the Alinity i system. The 2.5th and
97.5th percentiles (95% reference interval) and their respective 95% confidence intervals for
GFAP and UCH-L1 were determined non-parametrically and presented in the table below:

UCH-L1 160 108.1 45.28 98.0 44.7, 226.8
There were 21 healthy donors who tested positive for GFAP only and no donors were positive
for both GFAP and UCH-L1. The results summarized in the table below show that 86.9% have a
negative TBI test result and 16% have a positive TBI test result.

b
Although 13.1% of an apparently healthy population was found to have a positive TBI
interpretation, it is important to note GFAP and UCH-L1 cut-offs were optimized in a
population of patients with head injury.
It is the responsibility of each laboratory to establish its own reference ranges for the population
of patients it serves, as expected values may be affected by different factors including age.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
