*sO2 = ratio between the concentration of oxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin plus
deoxyhemoglobin.
pH, pCO2, and pO2 measurements in whole blood are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
life-threatening acid- base disturbances.
Electrolytes in the human body have multiple roles. Nearly all metabolic processes depend on or
vary with electrolytes:
– Sodium (Na+) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism, diabetes
insipidus, adrenal hypertension, Addison’s disease, dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic
secretion, or other diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.
– Potassium (K+) measurements are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and
treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium levels.
– Ionized calcium (Ca++) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid
disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease, and tetany.
– Chloride (Cl-) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and
metabolic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.
Hematocrit (Hct) measurements in whole blood of the packed red cell volume of a blood sample
are used to distinguish normal from abnormal states, such as anemia and erythrocytosis (an
increase in the number of red cells).
Glucose (Glu) measurement is used in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of carbohydrate
metabolism disturbances including diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, idiopathic
hypoglycemia, and pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
Lactate (Lac) measurement is used:
– to evaluate the acid-base status of patients suspected of having lactic acidosis;
– to monitor tissue hypoxia and strenuous physical exertion;
– in the diagnosis of hyperlactatemia.
Total Bilirubin (tBili) measurement is used to aid in assessing the risk of kernicterus and
hyperbilirubinemia in neonates.
CO-Oximetry (tHb, COHb, MetHb, O2Hb, HHb, and sO2) evaluates the ability of the blood to
carry oxygen by measuring total hemoglobin and determining the percentage of functional and
dysfunctional hemoglobin species.
– Total Hemoglobin (tHb): Total hemoglobin measurements are used to measure the hemoglobin
content of whole blood for the detection of anemia.
– COHb: Carboxyhemoglobin measurements are used to determine the carboxyhemoglobin
content of human blood as an aid in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning.
K223608 - Page 3 of 10

--- Page 4 ---
– MetHb: Methemoglobin measurements are used to determine different conditions of
methemoglobinemia.
– HHb: Deoxyhemoglobin, as a fraction of total hemoglobin, is used in combination with
oxyhemoglobin to measure oxygen status.
– O2Hb: Oxyhemoglobin, as a fraction of total hemoglobin, is used in combination with
deoxyhemoglobin to measure oxygen status.
– sO2: Oxygen saturation, more specifically the ratio between the concentration of
oxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin plus deoxyhemoglobin, is used to measure oxygen status.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
An internal precision study was performed in normal mode (syringe) and in micro mode
(capillary) using lithium heparin venous whole blood samples at 5 different levels for each
analytes and the results support that the precision is not changed by adding the hemolysis
detection feature to the device.
2. Linearity:
Previously established in K160225, K160412, and K160415.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
In addition to the studies described in K160225, K160412, and K160415, a new interference
study was performed to evaluate the potential impact of hemolysis interference on potassium
results. Venous whole blood was ultrasonically-lysed to generate a high hemolysis pool (100%
= 1000 mg/dL plasma-free hemoglobin). The high hemolysis pool was mixed with native
venous whole blood without hemolysis (0%) to generate 3 additional hemolysis levels (25%,
50%, 75%). Testing was performed using two concentrations of potassium: 3.8 mmol/L and
5.3 mmol/L. Each combination of potassium level and hemolysis level was tested in triplicate
on 3 GEM Premier 7000 with iQM , using 3 different cartridge lots, for a total of 9 replicates
3
of each hemolysis level/potassium level. Both the normal mode and the micro mode were
evaluated. Interference was calculated as the bias between the average result with the
interfering substance and the average control measurement. The sponsor considered no
significant interference to be ≤7% bias for this study. The highest level of hemolysis with no
significant interference was 115 mg/dL plasma-free hemoglobin. Hemolysis of ≥116 mg/dL
was found to have significant interferences the with potassium result.
The labeling contains the following statement:
Do not use hemolyzed samples, as hemolyzed samples may cause falsely elevated potassium
results. A GEM Premier 7000 with iQM hemolysis flag (estimated hemolysis = 116 mg/dL)
3
indicates hemolysis interference has been detected and the potassium result should not be

reported out of the laboratory. It is strongly recommended that hemolysis detection remain
enabled in order to detect hemolysis in samples.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Previously established in K160225, K160412, and K160415.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
As described in K160225, K160412, and K160415.
6. Detection Limit:
Previously established in K160225, K160412, and K160415.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
See method comparison study.
9. Carry-Over:
Not applicable
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Lithium heparin venous and arterial whole blood and fingerstick capillary samples were
assayed by 3 point-of-care (POC) operators at 1 simulated clinical site using 2 GEM Premier
7000 with iQM and 2 GEM Premier 5000. Venous and arterial samples were assayed in
3
normal mode and fingerstick capillary samples were assayed in normal mode and micro
mode. Each sample was run in singlicate on 1 GEM Premier 7000 with iQM and 1 GEM
3
Premier 5000. Deming Regression was used for analytes with constant SD and Passing-
Bablok was used for analytes with mixed variability. The results support that the addition of
the hemolysis detection feature did not impact the accuracy of device results in normal mode
or in micro mode.
The representative study results for venous and arterial samples from POC in normal mode
are shown below:

To verify the hemolysis flag performance of the GEM Premier 7000 with iQM in whole blood
3
samples, a hemolysis verification study was performed using a volumetric spiking procedure by
adjusting native (venous and arterial) whole blood samples with ultrasonically lysed whole blood
to span 6 hemolysis index categories to verify the hemolysis flag performance in venous and
arterial samples in normal mode. Hemolysate-contrived venous samples transferred to a capillary
device were tested in micro mode to verify the hemolysis flag performance in capillary samples.
All results were analyzed using a volumetric target value and overall agreement analysis was
performed for the pooled dataset (venous, arterial, and transferred capillary samples) as well as
for venous, arterial, and transferred capillary samples separately. All samples were correctly
flagged, and 99.2% of venous, 97.6% of arterial, and 99.2% of transferred capillary samples
were correctly flagged based on the target value of the spiked hemoglobin.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
