III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Both the Elecsys proBNP II and Elecsys proBNP II STAT have the following indications for use:
Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of N‐terminal pro‐Brain natriuretic
peptide (NT-proBNP) in human serum and plasma. This assay is used as an aid in the diagnosis of
individuals suspected of having heart failure (HF). It can be used as an aid in the diagnosis of acute
decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of ADHF to
the emergency department (ED). The assay is further indicated for the risk stratification of patients
with acute coronary syndrome and HF. The test may also serve as an aid in the assessment of
increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients at risk for HF who have stable
coronary artery disease.
The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” is intended for use on the cobas e
immunoassay analyzers.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys proBNP II and the Elecsys proBNP II STAT consist of three reagents in separate
bottles labeled M, R1, and R2:
• M: Streptavidin-coated microparticles (transparent cap), 1 bottle, 6.5 mL: Streptavidin-coated
microparticles 0.72 mg/mL; preservative
• R1: Anti-NT-proBNP-Ab~biotin (gray cap), 1 bottle, 9 mL: Biotinylated monoclonal
anti-NT-proBNP antibody (mouse) 1.1 μg/mL; phosphate buffer 40 mmol/L, pH 5.8;
preservative
• R2: Anti-NT-proBNP-Ab~Ru(bpy) (black cap), 1 bottle, 9 mL: Monoclonal anti-NT-proBNP
antibody (sheep) labeled with ruthenium complex 1.1 μg/mL; Biotin scavenger antibody 1.5
mg/mL; phosphate buffer 40 mmol/L, pH 5.8; preservative
K223637 - Page 2 of 20

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The Elecsys proBNP II assay follows the procedure below:
1st incubation: Antigen in the sample (15 μL), a biotinylated monoclonal NT-proBNP-specific
antibody, and a monoclonal NT-proBNP-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex
(Tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II)-complex (Ru(bpy) 2+ )) form a sandwich complex.
3
2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex becomes bound
to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically
captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed with
ProCell/ProCell M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent
emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
Results are determined via a calibration curve which is generated by 2-point calibration and a
master curve provided via the reagent barcode or e-barcode.
The Elecsys proBNP II STAT assay follows a similar procedure outlined above except that the
first and second incubations are combined into a single step. The total assay run time for the
Elecsys proBNP II is 18 min and for the Elecsys proBNP II STAT is 9 min.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The performance characteristics of the Elecsys ProBNP II STAT on the cobas e 601 analyzer are
described in K210456.
A Analytical Performance:
1. Repeatability and Intermediate Precision:
The precision of the Elecsys proBNP II assay was evaluated on one cobas e 601 analyzer at
one internal site with three reagent lots over 21 days.
Testing was conducted with eight serum samples and two controls in single determinations in
four separate aliquots (divided into two runs per day) for 21 operating days (n=84).
Repeatability, Between-Run, Between-Day, and Within-Laboratory Precision were calculated
per the recommendations in the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline.
Human serum samples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are pooled unaltered human serum samples. Samples
7 and 8 are human serum sample pools spiked with a synthetic NT-proBNP peptide. Results
from a representative lot are described below.

2. Linearity:
The linearity study was conducted using the Elecsys proBNP II on the cobas e 601 analyzer
following the recommendations in the CLSI guideline EP06 second edition. One high analyte
human native serum sample with a NT-proBNP concentration above the measuring rage was
diluted with analyte free serum. A total of 10 concentrations were prepared that spanned the
measuring range. Samples were assayed in 3-fold determination within a single run.
The maximum deviation from linearity observed within the claimed measuring range for the
Elecsys proBNP II was -16.8%.

2. Clinical Specificity:
See Section VII.C.3. below.
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. And 2. Are Not Applicable):
A multi-center prospective study including 17 sites in the United States was conducted to
establish the clinical performance characteristics of the Elecsys proBNP II and Elecsys
proBNP II STAT assays. Subjects 22 years and older admitted to the emergency department
(ED) suspected of or with symptoms of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) that
included acute dyspnea of a duration no longer than several days were enrolled in the study.
Subjects with renal insufficiency requiring dialysis or known estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) < 15.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 and subjects with dyspnea after chest trauma were
excluded from the study. The final clinical diagnosis was adjudicated by cardiologists or ED
physicians. The Elecsys proBNP II and Elecsys proBNP II STAT results were determined on
the Roche cobas e601 immunoassay analyzer using samples collected from 1485 ED subjects
consisting of 741 (49.9%) female subjects and 744 (50.1%) male subjects ranging in age from
22 to 97 years. Individuals in the population were Caucasian (57.4%), Black or African
American (37.2%), Asian (1.3%), American Indian or Alaska Native (0.3%), Native Hawaiian
or Other Pacific Islander (0.6%), or other race (1.3%) with the remaining 1.9% of unknown
race. 1238 (83.4%) ED subjects were not Hispanic or Latino and 190 (12.8%) ED subjects
were Hispanic or Latino with the remaining 57 (3.8%) ED subjects of unknown ethnicity.
The descriptive statistics for the Elecsys proBNP II and Elecsys proBNP II STAT results
(pg/mL) were determined within and across sex by age group. The results using the Elecsys
proBNP II STAT assay are summarized below and are similar to the results obtained using the

The pretest probability of ADHF (prevalence of ADHF in the study), posttest probabilities,
likelihood ratios and the 95% CIs of the Elecsys proBNP II result versus adjudicated diagnosis
and Elecsys proBNP II STAT result versus adjudicated diagnosis were determined for the
relevant clinical subgroups using the age-dependent positive (450 pg/mL for subjects <50 years
of age; 900 pg/mL for subjects 50–75 years of age; 1800 pg/mL for subjects ≥ 75 years of age)
and age-independent negative (300 pg/mL) cutoffs. The results using the Elecsys proBNP II
STAT assay are summarized below and are similar to the results obtained using the Elecsys
proBNP II:

The sponsor included the following information in the labeling.
“Patients with a history of prior HF have a substantially lower performance for positive cut-
points compared to the performance in all evaluable subjects of the ICON-Reloaded cohort,
which is likely due to a chronic biological elevation of NT-proBNP in these conditions. Higher
false positive rates were observed in all subjects and higher false negative rates were seen in

D Clinical Cut-Off:
In this submission, the sponsor added the following cut-offs for use as an aid in the diagnosis of
ADHF in patients presenting to emergency departments:
Elecsys proBNP II / Elecsys
proBNP II STAT Cut-Points
Age Group Interpretation
All ages 300 pg/mL NT-proBNP < 300 pg/mL indicates ADHF not
likely
< 50 years 450 pg/mL NT-proBNP > 450 pg/mL indicates ADHF is likely
50 to 75 years 900 pg/mL NT-proBNP > 900 pg/mL indicates ADHF is likely
> 75 years 1800 pg/mL NT-proBNP > 1800 pg/mL indicates ADHF is
likely
All ages Results within the gray zone Indeterminate. Further clinical information is
for the patient’s age group needed to determine if ADHF is present
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Reference ranges for individuals without heart failure were previously established in K022516.
Also see Section VII.C.3., which describes NT-proBNP levels in subjects without ADHF
presenting to the ED.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
