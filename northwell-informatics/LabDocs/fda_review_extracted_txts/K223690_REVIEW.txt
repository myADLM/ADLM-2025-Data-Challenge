B Principle of Operation:
The iFlash-HCG assay is a sandwich immunoassay using a direct chemiluminometric technique.
The hCG in the sample reacts with anti-HCG antibody-coated paramagnetic microparticles and
acridinium-labeled anti-HCG antibody conjugate to form a sandwich complex. After incubation,
materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are
washed away. Then the pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The
resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs) by the iFlash
optical system. The RLUs detected production is directly proportional to the analyte in the
sample. Analyte concentration is determined from a calibration curve, which is generated by 3-
point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent QR code.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the iFlash-HCG Assay was evaluated according to CLSI EP05-A3 using nine
serum samples and two levels of controls. Each sample was measured in two replicates per
run with two runs per day over 20 days by three different operators at three different sites
using three lots of the reagents on three different Chemiluminescence Immunoassay
Analyzer (Model: iFlash 3000-C) resulting in a total of 240 test results per level. Results
from one analyzer are provided in the table below.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the iFlash-HCG Assay was evaluated following recommendations in CLSI
EP06-Ed2. Three linearity studies were performed using eleven serum samples each. Varying
concentrations of hCG were obtained by mixing low level serum samples and high level
serum samples. All three studies were performed using three lots of reagents on one
Chemiluminescence Immunoassay Analyzer (Model: iFlash 3000-C).
In the first study, linearity was established by testing samples with concentrations ranging
from 0.43 to 11786.53 mIU/mL. Each sample was tested in four replicates.
A regression analysis was conducted resulting in the following linear regression equation:
y = 0.9824x + 38.719, R2 = 0.9994
In the second study, mid-range linearity was established by testing samples with hCG
concentrations ranging from 0.45 to 1,050.30 mIU/mL. Each sample was tested in four

replicates. A regression analysis was conducted resulting in the following linear regression
equation: y = 0.9994x - 0.545, R2 = 0.9996
In the third study, low-range linearity was established by testing samples with concentrations
ranging from 0.46 to 128.02 mIU/mL. Each sample level was tested in four replicates.
A regression analysis was conducted resulting in the following linear regression equation:
y = 1.014x -2.857, R2 = 0.9995
The results from the linearity studies and limit of quantitation studies (LOQ = 0.50 ng/mL,
see below), supports the sponsor’s claimed analytical measuring interval of 0.50 to 10,000
mIU/mL.
Dilution Studies
Dilution studies were performed to determine the sample recovery after a 1:100 dilution
either manually or automatically by the Chemiluminescence Immunoassay Analyzer (Model:
iFlash 3000-C). The dilution study results support labeling claims that samples with hCG
concentrations above 10,000 mIU/mL may be diluted 1:50 or 1:100 with sample diluent
either manually or automatically on-onboard the analyzer.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference
The potential interference of certain exogenous and endogenous substances was assessed
using female human serum pool samples containing approximately 6 mIU/mL and 5000
mIU/mL (“low” and “high” respectively) hCG spiked with various concentrations of
substances based on recommendations in CLSI EP7-A2. The following endogenous
substances do not interfere with this assay at the levels tested (less than 10% bias between the
test sample and the control sample).

reactants: luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), or thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH). Samples were tested in replicates of five using three lots of
reagents on one iFlash 3000-C analyzer. The results demonstrated no cross-reactivity from
potential cross-reactants up to 500 mIU/mL LH, 200 mIU/mL FSH, and 10000 mIU/mL TSH

6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of the
iFlash-HCG Assay were evaluated based upon recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.
Limit of Blank
For determination of limit of blank (LoB), five analyte free samples were tested with three
lots of reagents over at least three days on one Chemiluminescence Immunoassay Analyzer
(Model: iFlash 3000-C) in four runs with five replicates per run over three days. In total 60
measured values of analyte free samples were obtained per lot. The LOB was determined to
be 0.10 mIU/mL.
Limit of Detection
For determination of limit of detection (LoD), five serum samples containing low – analyte
concentration (approximately 1-5 times LoB) were tested with three lots of reagents on one
Chemiluminescence Immunoassay Analyzer (Model: iFlash 3000-C) in four runs with five
replicates per run over three days. In total 60 measured values of samples with low analyte
concentrations were obtained per lot. The LoD was determined to be 0.20 mIU/mL.
Limit of Quantitation
For determination of limit of quantitation (LoQ), five human serum samples covering the
range between 0.30 and 70 mIU/mL were tested with three lots of reagents on one
Chemiluminescence Immunoassay Analyzer (Model: iFlash 3000-C) in four runs with five
replicates per run over three days. Limit of quantitation (LoQ) is the lowest concentration
which is the design requirements of TEa%(Total Error Allowance) of ≤30%. The LoQ was
determined to be 0.50 mIU/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable; this is a quantitative assay.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable.
9. Carry-Over:
Samples with high hCG (1,250,000 mIU/mL) and low hCG (3.03 mIU/mL) hCG were tested
alternating five times (i.e. HH,LL,HH,LL, etc.) in replicates of three, using one reagent lot on
one Chemiluminescence Immunoassay Analyzer (Model: iFlash 3000-C). No significant
sample carryover effect was observed.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were conducted following recommendations in CLSI EP09-A3
Guideline. A total of 110 female human serum samples were tested in singlicate using iFlash-
HCG Assay on Chemiluminescence Immunoassay Analyzer (Model: iFlash 3000-C)

Not applicable.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Serum samples from 130 healthy, non-pregnant premenopausal women and 125 healthy,
postmenopausal women were tested using the iFlash-HCG on the Chemiluminescence
Immunoassay Analyzer (Model: iFlash 3000-C) according to CLSI EP28-A3c. The reference
interval was calculated using the nonparametric method according to CLSI C28-A3, and was
determined to be 0.05 - 0.85 mIU/mL for women ≤ age 50, and 0.1 - 4.4 mIU/mL for women
over age 50. The central 95% reference interval was established to be 0.6 mIU/mL for
premenopausal women and 5.4 mIU/mL for post-menopausal women.
It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own expected reference range for the
specific population.
F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Not applicable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
