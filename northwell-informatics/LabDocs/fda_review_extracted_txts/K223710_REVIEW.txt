III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The i-STAT CG8+ cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System is intended for use in the in vitro
quantification of glucose in arterial, venous or capillary whole blood in point of care or clinical
laboratory settings.
Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of carbohydrate
metabolism disorders including, but not limited to, diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia,
idiopathic hypoglycemia, and pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
The i-STAT 1 Analyzer is intended for use in the in vitro quantification of various analytes in
whole blood or plasma in point of care or clinical laboratory settings. Analyzers and cartridges
should be used by healthcare professionals trained and certified to use the system and should be
used according to the facility's policies and procedures.
The i-STAT System is for in vitro diagnostics use. Caution: Federal law restricts this device to
sale by or on the order of a licensed practitioner.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx – For Prescription Use Only
For point-of-care or clinical laboratory setting.
Capillary whole blood specimens (e.g., obtained by fingerstick) should not be used in patients
receiving intensive medical intervention/therapy because of the potential for pre-analytical
collection error and specifically in patients with decreased peripheral blood flow, as it may not
reflect the true physiological state. Examples include, but are not limited to, severe hypotension,
shock, hyperosmolar-hyperglycemia (with or without ketosis) and severe dehydration.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
i-STAT 1 Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT 1 System is an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical device, consists of the i-STAT
analyzer and single -use disposable cartridges, and is intended for the quantitative determination
of various clinical chemistry tests contained within i-STAT cartridges using whole blood.
K223710 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
The i-STAT 1 analyzer is a handheld, in vitro diagnostic analytical device designed to run only i-
STAT test cartridges. The instrument interacts with the i-STAT CG8+ cartridge to move fluid
across the sensors and generate a quantitative result.
The single-use, disposable i-STAT CG8+ cartridge contains the required sensors, a fluid pack
(calibrant pouch), a sample entry well and closure, fluid channels, waste chamber, and the
necessary mechanical features for controlled fluid movement within the cartridge. The i-STAT
cartridge format allows all the tests in the cartridge to be performed simultaneously. All the test
steps and fluid movement occur within the i-STAT CG8+ cartridge. Cartridges require two to
three drops of whole blood, which are typically applied to the cartridge using a transfer device,
by the trained user before the cartridge is placed within the analyzer.
B Principle of Operation:
Glucose on the i-STAT CG8+ cartridge is measured amperometrically. A voltage is applied to
the cartridge electrodes with current generated by the reduction of hydrogen peroxide that was
produced by catalytic oxidation of glucose present in the sample by glucose oxidase. The current
is directly proportional to the concentration of the glucose in the sample.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
i-STAT 1 Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
The specimen identification may be manually entered or automatically scanned by the
device.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The sample type must be selected using the device touchscreen. After the sample type is
selected the on-screen help appears and the help graphics on the device screen vary based on
the sample type selected. The reagent cartridge contains a sample chamber that includes the
sample well and the channel leading from the well up to the fill mark. The cartridge label is
intended to help the operator fill the cartridge correctly. When filled, the sample chamber
contains sufficient sample for testing. Sample volume and placement are monitored by the
instrument and an error message will be generated if filled incorrectly. Samples should be
remixed thoroughly before testing.
4. Calibration:
The i-STAT cartridges include an on-board calibration that is performed with each cartridge
use. The calibrant solution is automatically released from its foil pack and is positioned over
K223710 - Page 3 of 13

--- Page 4 ---
the sensors. The signals produced by the sensors’ responses to the calibrant solution are
measured. This one-point calibration adjusts the offset of the stored calibration curve.
5. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends i-STAT Controls and TriControls for use with the i-STAT
cartridges with the i-STAT 1 System.

heparin venous whole blood samples at two glucose concentrations: low (30 – 50 mg/dL and
high (210 – 230 mg/dL). The effect of each substance at each analyte level was evaluated by
comparing the performance of a test sample spiked to a high concentration of the substance
and a control sample spiked with an equal volume of solvent. Each sample was measured in
replicates of at least 10 using two lots of the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge. The sponsor
identified a substance as an interferent if the difference in the mean between the control and
test sample was outside of the predefined allowable error of ± greater of 6 mg/dL or 10% of

significant interference is expected. The results are given in the table below:
Substance Concentration Interference
Bromide (Lithium Bromide) ≥ 18.09 mmol/L Decreased glucose results
Hydroxyurea ≥ 0.09 mmol/L Increased glucose results
Isoniazid ≥ 0.29 mmol/L Increased glucose results
The sponsor included the following limitations in the labeling:
Bromide at 2.5 mmol/L is the peak plasma concentration associated with halothane

anesthesia, in which bromide is released. Bromide may result in an increased rate of star
outs (***).
Hydroxyurea is a DNA synthesis inhibitor used in the treatment of sickle cell anemia,
o
HIV infection, and various types of cancer. The malignancies that it is used to treat
include melanoma, metastatic ovarian cancer, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. It is
also used in the treatment of polycythemia vera, thrombocythemia, and psoriasis. At
typical doses ranging from 500 mg to 2 g/day, concentrations of hydroxyurea in a
patient’s blood may be sustained at approximately 0.1 to 0.5 mmol/L (100 to 500
μmol/L). Higher concentrations may be observed soon after dosing or at higher
therapeutic doses.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See section A.2 Linearity.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Glucose values assigned to i-STAT controls and calibration verification materials are
traceable to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard
reference material SRM965.
Sample stability
A study was conducted to verify the whole blood sample stability after sample collection
with and without anticoagulants for i-STAT Glucose test using the i-STAT CG8+ cartridge
(white) on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer. The results support the sponsor’s sample stability claims.

6. Detection Limit:
Detection capability studies of limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of
quantitation (LoQ) for the i-STAT glucose assay on the i-STAT CG8+ cartridge (white) with
the i-STAT 1 Analyzer were conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.
The LoB was evaluated for the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge using a lithium heparin
venous whole blood sample that was altered to create a blank sample. The sample was tested
across four days using two lots of i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridges. The LoB was calculated
using a parametric data analysis approach for each of the two lots. The higher of the two LoB
values from each lot is reported in the labeling as the LoB.
The LoD was determined using a lithium heparin venous whole blood sample that was
altered to create two samples with low concentrations of glucose. Each sample was measured
in 20 replicates per day for four days across each of two i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge lots.
The LoD was calculated using a parametric data analysis approach for each of the two lots.
The higher of the two LoD values from each lot is reported as the LoD.
The LoQ was evaluated using lithium heparin venous whole blood samples altered to create
four samples with low concentrations of glucose. Each of the four samples was measured in
12 replicates per day for four days across each of two i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge lots.
The LoQ was calculated for each of the two lots. The sponsor defined LoQ as the greater of
the two lots at which the lowest concentration met the pre-defined total error goal of 6.00
mg/dL.
The results from all studies are summarized in the table below.
Analyte (Units) Reportable range LoB LoD LoQ
Glucose (mg/dL) 20 – 700 0.2 0.9 17.0

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP09c-
3rd ed guideline.
Lithium heparin venous (native n=174, contrived n=8) and arterial (native n=157) whole
blood specimens collected across three point of care sites were tested for glucose using the i-
STAT CG8+ cartridge (white) on the i-STAT 1 analyzer (candidate device) and the i-STAT
CHEM 8+ cartridge on the i-STAT 1 analyzer (predicate device). A Passing-Bablok linear
regression analysis was performed using the singlicate result from the candidate device
versus the mean results of the comparative method. The sponsor provided acceptable
evidence to support pooling the results from venous and arterial samples in the same
analysis. Accuracy results for arterial and venous whole blood specimens are shown in the
table below.
Range tested mg/dL
N Slope Intercept r
(per comparator)
339* 24 - 695 0.98 0.16 1.00
*Includes eight (8) contrived venous specimens tested at an internal site.
Capillary whole blood specimens (n=208, including 22 samples from neonates) collected
from skin puncture with balanced heparin capillary tubes collected across six point of care
sites were tested for glucose using i-STAT CG8+ cartridges on the i‑STAT 1 analyzer and the
epoc Blood Analysis System (comparator method, k200107). A Passing-Bablok linear
regression analysis was performed using the singlicate result from the candidate device
versus the singlicate result of the comparative method.
Accuracy results for capillary whole blood specimens are shown in the table below.
Range tested mg/dL
N Slope Intercept r
(per comparator)
208 26 - 657 1.02 1.21 0.99
2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the i-STAT
Glucose test in the i-STAT CG8+ cartridge (white) on the i-STAT 1 System using non-
anticoagulated venous and arterial whole blood specimens following the recommendations in
CLSI EP35.
The results of the matrix comparison studies support that the glucose can be tested using
lithium heparin and un-anticoagulated venous and arterial whole blood. The assay can also
be used for testing heparinized capillary whole blood samples.
