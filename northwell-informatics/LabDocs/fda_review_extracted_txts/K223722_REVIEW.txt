A Device Description:
The MIO Blood Glucose Monitoring System is designed to quantitatively measure the glucose
concentration in fresh capillary whole blood obtained from the fingertip. The MIO Blood
Glucose Monitoring System consists of the MIO Blood Glucose Meter, the MIO Blood Glucose
Test Strips, three levels of MIO Control Solutions (Levels 1, 2 and 3) and the MIO Lancing
Device with MIO Lancets. The MIO test strips, control solutions and lancing device with lancets
are sold separately. MIO Blood Glucose Monitoring System reports glucose results as plasma
glucose.
K223722 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The glucose measurement is achieved by using an amperometric detection method. The test is
based on the measurement of an electrical current caused by the reaction of glucose with the
reagents on the electrode of the test strip. When a drop of blood is applied to the test strip it is
pulled into the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose
oxidase and the mediator in the test strip generating electrons and producing a current that is
proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. After the reaction time, the detected
current is calculated by the meter and the resulting glucose concentration is displayed by the meter.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
MIO Blood Glucose Meter
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose system is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only.
The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
4. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The meter is automatically
coded.
5. Quality Control:
Three levels of glucose control solutions are available for use with this system and can be
purchased separately. Recommendations on when to test with control solutions are provided
in the labeling. Acceptable ranges for each level of control solution are printed on the test
strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside
these ranges. The control solution readings are automatically marked by the meter as control
results and are not included in the patient result averages.
This medical device product has functions subject to FDA premarket review as well as functions
that are not subject to FDA premarket review. For this application, if the product has functions
that are not subject to FDA premarket review, FDA assessed those functions only to the extent
that they either could adversely impact the safety and effectiveness of the functions subject to
FDA premarket review or they are included as a labeled positive impact that was considered in
the assessment of the functions subject to FDA premarket review.

the result is flagged by the meter as “Lo”. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose, the
result is flagged by the meter as “Hi”. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated by the
sponsor and were demonstrated to function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To assess potential interferences, the sponsor used venous whole blood samples adjusted to
achieve 3 glucose concentration ranges: 50-70, 110-130, and 225-270 mg/dL. Each of these
samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool, with each of the potential
endogenous and exogenous interfering substances added to the test pool. The % difference
between the test sample and the control sample was calculated using the mean of 10
replicates for each of the 3 strip lots tested. The highest tested concentrations at which no
significant interference was observed (defined by the sponsor as less than ±10% bias between
the test and control samples) are presented in the following table:

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit study
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood samples
with hematocrit levels of 20-70% (20, 25, 30, 35, 42, 50, 55, 60, 65, and 70%) at five levels
of glucose (40, 70, 130, 200, and 325 md/dL). Each sample was tested in replicates of 10
using 10 meters and three test strip lots. Results from the meter were compared to results
obtained using a laboratory-based comparator measurement. The evaluation of bias and
percent bias relative to values obtained on the YSI 2300 analyzer demonstrated acceptable
performance across the claimed hematocrit range of 20-70%.

2. System Operating Conditions Testing
The sponsor performed an operating condition study using venous whole blood samples
adjusted to 3 glucose levels (65.2, 112.5, and 351.0 mg/dL). Testing was conducted under
the following five temperature and relative humidity (RH) combinations: 113°F (45°C) and
41°F (5°C), at 10% and 90% RH each and at 73°F (23°C) at 40% RH. The candidate system
results were compared to results from the YSI 2300 comparator method. The results support
the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 41–113°F (5-45°C)
with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
Altitude Effects
To evaluate the effects of altitude on the MIO Blood Glucose Monitoring System a study was
conducted using fingerstick whole blood samples altered to achieve 15 glucose
concentrations ranging from 45.0 to 486 mg/dL. Each sample was tested using 3 test strip
lots and 6 glucose meters at 10,413 feet. The candidate system results were compared to
those obtained with the comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results support the
claims that the system functions as intended at altitudes up to the claimed altitude of 10,413
feet.
3. Sample Volume
Three venous blood samples were prepared at three glucose range intervals (59.1, 110.5, and
223.0 mg/dL) and were tested at different sample volumes (0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 μL). Meter
results were compared against the YSI 2300 comparator method measurements. Results
support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.8 μL. The sponsor provided validation
studies demonstrating that with blood volumes below 0.8 μL, the insufficient sample volume
error message functioned as intended.
4. Flex Studies
The following additional flex studies were performed with the MIO Blood Glucose
Monitoring System: sample perturbation, intermittent sampling, sample outside measuring
range, used test strips, drop, and shipping testing. The testing demonstrated that the device is
robust under these conditions.
5. Electrical Safety and EMC Testing
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed, and the system was found
to be compliant.
6. Infection Control Testing
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the external meter materials by an outside commercial testing laboratory
demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant,
Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes (EPA Registration #67619-12). A robustness
study was also conducted by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in
performance or in the external materials of the meter after 608 cleaning and disinfection
cycles using the Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes. The robustness studies were
designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient device use. Labeling was reviewed for
adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
