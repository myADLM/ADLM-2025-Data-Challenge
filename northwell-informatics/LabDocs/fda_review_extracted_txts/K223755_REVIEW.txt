III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The i-STAT G cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System is intended for use in the in vitro
quantification of glucose in arterial, venous or capillary whole blood in point of care or clinical
laboratory settings.
Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of carbohydrate
metabolism disorders including, but not limited to, diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia,
idiopathic hypoglycemia, and pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx – For Prescription Use Only
For Point-of-care use or clinical laboratory setting.
Capillary whole blood specimens (e.g., obtained by fingerstick) should not be used in patients
receiving intensive medical intervention/therapy because of the potential for pre-analytical
collection error and specifically in patients with decreased peripheral blood flow, as it may not
reflect the true physiological state. Examples include, but are not limited to, severe hypotension,
shock, hyperosmolar-hyperglycemia (with or without ketosis) and severe dehydration.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
i-STAT 1 Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT G (white) cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System is a single-use and disposable unit that
contains test reagents and sensors for the glucose measurement. Cartridges require two to three
drops of whole blood, which are applied to the cartridge using a transfer device, by the trained user
before the cartridge is placed within the analyzer. All the test steps and fluid movements occur
within the i-STAT G cartridge (white). The test reagents and internal fluids do not contact the
analyzer or user.
B Principle of Operation:
Glucose on the i-STAT G cartridge (white) is measured amperometrically. A voltage is applied to
the cartridge electrodes with current generated by the reduction of hydrogen peroxide that was
produced by catalytic oxidation of glucose present in the sample by glucose oxidase. The current
is directly proportional to the concentration of the glucose in the sample.

2. Linearity:
The linearity study was designed based on the CLSI EP06 2nd ed guideline. The linearity of
the i-STAT Glucose test in the i-STAT G cartridge (white) with the i-STAT 1 System was
evaluated by preparing a total 11 samples with concentrations spanning the claimed measuring
range. Each level was tested in replicates of two per cartridge lot for a total of 10 results per
level. An assessment of linearity was performed using weighted least squares linear regression.
At each concentration level, the deviation from linearity was within ± 3%. The regression
parameters for the linearity study are summarized below:
Specimen Claimed

Range Measurement Slope Intercept R2
levels
(mg/dL) Range (mg/dL)
11 15.3 – 793.3 20 – 700 1.002 -1.258 0.999
The linearity data supported the claimed reportable range of 20 to 700 mg/dL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the i-STAT Glucose assay on the i-STAT G cartridge (white) was
established by conducting interference testing following the recommendations from CLSI
EP07-3rd ed guideline. Interference from certain exogenous and endogenous substances was
assessed using lithium heparin whole blood samples at two glucose concentrations: low (30 -
50 mg/dL) and high (210-230 mg/dL). The samples with high and low analyte levels were
further divided into two groups: i.e., test sample (with added interferent) and control sample
(without interferent). Each sample level was tested in duplicates for each of the five (5) i-STAT
G cartridge lots (for a total of 10 results per level) on multiple i-STAT 1 analyzers.
The effect of each substance at each analyte level was evaluated by comparing the test results
of a control sample, i.e., spiked with blank solvent solution, with the test results from a sample
spiked with the potentially interfering substance at the toxic or pathological concentration
based on CLSI EP37.
The sponsor defines that interference is considered non-significant if the bias between the test
and control sample are within ± 10% for all test interferences. The following table lists the
concentrations of each substance at which no significant interference was found.

Hydroxyurea ≥ 0.08 mmol/L Increased glucose results
Isoniazid* ≥ 0.29 mmol/L Increased glucose results
*Isoniazid interferes at low glucose concentration.
The sponsor included the following statements in the labeling:
Bromide at 2.5 mmol/L is the peak plasma concentration associated with halothane
o
anesthesia, in which bromide is released.
Hydroxyurea is a DNA synthesis inhibitor used in the treatment of sickle cell anemia, HIV
o
infection, and various types of cancer. The malignancies that it is used to treat include
melanoma, metastatic ovarian cancer, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. It is also used
in the treatment of polycythemia vera, thrombocythemia, and psoriasis. At typical doses
ranging from 500 mg to 2 g/day, concentrations of hydroxyurea in a patient’s blood may
be sustained at approximately 0.1 to 0.5 mmol/L (100 to 500 μmol/L). Higher
concentrations may be observed soon after dosing or at higher therapeutic doses.
The sponsor conducted studies to assess the effect of oxygen on the i-STAT G cartridge (white)
on the i-STAT 1 System. Protocols and results were reviewed and found acceptable to support
that the test is insensitive to oxygen levels between 21 and 515 mmHg.
The sponsor conducted studies to assess the effect of hematocrit on the i-STAT G cartridge
(white) on the i-STAT 1 System. Protocols and results were reviewed and found acceptable to
support that the test is insensitive to hematocrit levels between 15% to 75%.
The sponsor conducted studies to assess the effect of altitude on the i-STAT G cartridge (white)
on the i-STAT 1 System. Protocols and results were reviewed and found acceptable to support
that the test yields accurate results up to approximately 10,000 feet above sea level.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See section A.2 Linearity.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The glucose assay on the i-STAT G cartridge is traceable to the U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) standard reference material SRM965.

Sample Stability
A study was conducted to verify the whole blood sample stability after sample collection
with and without anticoagulants for the i-STAT G cartridge (white) on the i-STAT 1
Analyzer. The results support the sponsor’s sample stability claims.
6. Detection Limit:
Detection capability studies of limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of
quantification (LoQ) for i-STAT G Glucose test on the i-STAT G cartridge (white) with the
i-STAT 1 analyzer were conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.
The LoB was evaluated for the i-STAT G cartridge (white) using lithium heparin whole
blood samples altered to create blank samples. The samples were tested across three days
using two lots of the i-STAT G cartridge (white). The LoB for each lot was calculated
following the EP17-A2 guideline. The higher of the two LoB values from each lot is reported
as the LoB.
The LoD was evaluated using lithium heparin venous whole blood samples that were altered
to create four (4) samples with low concentrations of glucose. Each of the low samples was
measured using 20 i-STAT G cartridges (white) from each of two (2) cartridge lots. The LoD
was calculated for each lot following the EP17-A2 guideline. The higher of the two LoD
values from each lot is reported as the LoD.
The LoQ was evaluated using lithium heparin venous whole blood samples that were altered
to create four (4) samples with low concentrations of glucose. Each sample was measured in
twelve (12) replicates per lot across two i-STAT G cartridge lots. The LoQ was calculated for
each of the two lots. The LoQ was defined as the greater of the two lots at which the lowest
concentration met the pre-defined total error goal, i.e., ≤ 6 mg/dL.
The results from all studies are summarized in the table below:
