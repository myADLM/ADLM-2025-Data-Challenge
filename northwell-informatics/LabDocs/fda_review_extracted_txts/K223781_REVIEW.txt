B Indication(s) for Use:
The Quantisal™ II Oral Fluid Collection Device is intended for the collection, preservation and
transport of oral fluid specimens for drugs of abuse testing. This device is for prescription use
only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The Quantisal II Oral Fluid Collection Devices has been previously cleared for the measurement
of THC, Benzoylecgonine, 6-acetylmorphine, Phencyclidine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine,
Buprenorphine, Methadone, Nordiazepam, and Tramadol. Use of the device for the collection,
preservation, and transport of any other analyte for drugs of abuse testing should be validated
prior to such use.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Quantisal™ II Oral Fluid Collection Device is intended for the collection, preservation, and
transport of oral fluid specimens for drugs of abuse testing. The Quantisal II device
simultaneously collects two 1 mL ± 10% oral fluid samples. Each device contains a split
collector made up of two cellulose pads affixed to a two component polypropylene stem and two
transportation tubes (labelled A and B).
B Principle of Operation:
The Quantisal II device is designed to simultaneously collect two oral fluid samples. Each device
contains a split collector made up of two cellulose pads with cellulose extending into the interior
of a two-component polypropylene stem. Blue dye is pre-applied to the cellulose inside the stem.
When the cellulose pads are placed under the tongue of a donor, oral fluid is collected via
passive diffusion. Upon saturating the cellulose pad, oral fluid migrates along the cellulose tail
through capillary action and dissolves the dye. As oral fluid collection continues, the dye
becomes visible in the windows on the stem. Specimen collection is complete when the windows
are completely blue on both sides of the stem. The device stem is split into two separate
components, collector 1 and collector 2, each of which contains one half of the stem and a single
pad saturated with of oral fluid. The separated pads are transferred into provided polypropylene
transport tubes (Tube A and Tube B) which contain 3 mL of preservative buffer each. The
preservative buffer serves as a reservoir into which analytes may distribute, permitting recovery
of analytes from the pad during the time the specimens are in storage or being transported.
