III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
IDS ACTH II assay is an automated in vitro diagnostic device intended for the quantitative,
determination of ACTH in human K2 and K3 EDTA plasma on the IDS system. Results are to be
used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory data as an aid in the assessment of pituitary
and adrenal gland function and the differential diagnosis of hyper- and hypo-cortisolism.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
IDS-iSYS Multi-Discipline Automated Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Components of the candidate device include:
• Magnetic particles coated with mouse monoclonal anti-ACTH antibody and buffer
containing phosphate with blocking proteins and ProClin 300 as preservative (<0.1%), 1
bottle, 2.5 mL
• Mouse monoclonal anti-ACTH antibody labeled with an acridinium ester derivative, in
buffer containing phosphate with BSA and ProClin 300 as preservative (<0.1%), 1 bottle,
6.5 mL
• Buffer containing phosphate with blocking proteins and ProClin 300 as preservative
(<0.1%), 1 bottle, 3.5 mL
• A mini-CD containing documentation
B Principle of Operation:
The assay is based on chemiluminescence technology. 150 µL of patient sample or calibrators
are incubated with monoclonal anti-ACTH antibody-coated magnetic particles. Following the
first incubation step, an acridinium-labeled ACTH antibody conjugate is added, followed by a
subsequent incubation step. The magnetic particles are captured using a magnet, and a wash step
is performed to remove any unbound analyte. Trigger reagents are added; the resulting light
emitted by the acridinium label is proportional to the concentration of analyte in the original
sample.

deviation from linearity observed within the claimed measuring range was 11.1%. The results
support the claimed measuring range of 4 to 1000 pg/mL.

The analytical specificity of the IDS ACTH II assay on the IDS-iSYS Multi-Discipline
Automated Analyzer was established by conducting interference testing following the
recommendations in CLSI EP07 third edition guideline.
Interference from endogenous and exogenous substances was assessed using plasma samples
containing ACTH at 15 pg/mL and 200 pg/mL. Each sample was further divided into two
aliquots: a test sample (with added interferent) and a control sample (with no added
interferent). Each sample was tested in a minimum of 4 replicates. The difference between
the mean concentration of the test and control sample were calculated. The following table
lists the highest concentration of each substance at which no significant interference was
found, defined as a difference of less than or equal to ±10% between the test sample and
control.
Interferent Highest interferent concentration tested
that showed no significant interference
Triglycerides 1500 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 62.5 mg/dL
Bilirubin, unconjugated 40 mg/dL
Bilirubin, conjugated 40 mg/dL
Protein (total) 15 g/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 324 IU/mL
HAMA 1000 ng/mL
Biotin 3.5 μg/mL
Acetaminophen 15.6 mg/dL
Acetylsalicylic acid 3 mg/dL
Ampicillin 7.5 mg/dL
Ibuprofen 21.9 mg/dL
Dexamethasone 1.2 mg/dL
Metyrapone 1.8 mg/L
The following statements are included as limitations in the device labeling:
The lowest Hemoglobin level that does not significantly interfere (≤±10% bias) with the
assay is 62.5 mg/dL. Visual hemolysis in the sample is typically already seen in samples
with hemoglobin concentration of 50 mg/dL or greater [Hemolysis_Palette_Bookmark-
P.pdf (cdc.gov)]. Visibly hemolyzed samples must not be used with IDS ACTH II assay.
As with all tests containing monoclonal mouse antibodies, erroneous findings may be
obtained from samples taken from patients who have been treated with monoclonal
mouse antibodies or who have received them for diagnostic purposes.
Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins,
interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to
animal serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may be
observed.
The lowest Rheumatoid Factor (RF) level that does not significantly interfere (≤±10% bias)
with IDS ACTH II assay is 324 IU/mL.

Cholesterol interference was assessed by testing plasma samples with ACTH concentrations
of 30 and 500 pg/mL. Each sample was further divided into two aliquots: a test sample (with
added interferent) and a control sample (with no added interferent). Each sample was tested
in 5 replicates. The difference between the mean concentration of the test and control sample
was calculated. The highest level tested that demonstrated no significant interference (<10%)
was 400 mg/dL.
Cross-Reactivity: Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking structurally similar compounds
described below into ACTH-free urine. The results are summarized in the table below. No
significant cross-reactivity was observed in the following compounds at the indicated
concentration.

Studies evaluating high-dose hook effect demonstrated that samples containing ACTH
concentrations up to 3 × 106 pg/mL do not give falsely low results with this assay.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay measuring interval is 4-1000 pg/mL.
The sponsor provided data to support that the measuring interval can be extended up to 1,500
mg/dL following manual dilution.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The IDS ACTH II Calibrators are traceable to a commercially available ACTH assay.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
determined using three reagent lots on one analyzer over three days. LoB was established
with four blank samples, five replicates, once per day for three days (n = 60 replicates/lot).
LoD and LoQ were established with six low level samples tested on five replicates each,
once per day for three days (n = 90 replicates/lot). The claimed LoB for the IDS ACTH II is
0 pg/mL and the claimed LoD is 1 pg/mL. LoQ was determined to be 3 pg/mL as the lowest
concentration measured with a within-laboratory precision CV ≤ 20%.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not Applicable
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted comparing the IDS ACTH II assay (y) with the
Roche Elecsys ACTH (x). A total of 170 samples were tested in duplicate using one lot of the
IDS ACTH II device and tested in single replicate using one lot of the Elecsys ACTH. Only
the first replicate of IDS ACTH II was used for data analysis. Data were analyzed using
Passing Bablok regression analysis. Results are shown below:
