III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access CEA assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) levels in human serum, using
the Access Immunoassay Systems. CEA measured by the Access Immunoassay Systems is used
as an aid in the management of cancer patients in whom changing CEA concentrations have been
observed.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The Instruction for use of the device contains the following warnings:
The concentration of CEA in a given specimen determined with different manufacturers can vary
due to differences in assay methods and reagent specificity. The results reported by the
laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the CEA assay used. Values obtained
with different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably. If, in the course of monitoring a
patient, the assay method used for determining CEA values is changed, additional sequential
testing should be carried out to confirm baseline values.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (refer to K221225)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Access CEA Reagent Kit
Each Access CEA reagent kit contains two reagent packs (50 tests/pack). Each pack contains the
following:
• Solid phase: Paramagnetic particles coated with mouse anti-CEA MAb, suspended in
TRIS buffered bovine serum albumin (BSA), with < 0.1% sodium azide and 0.1%
ProClin 300
• Diluent: Phosphate buffer, protein (bovine, murine) with < 0.1% sodium azide and 0.1%
ProClin 300
• Conjugate: Mouse anti-CEA MAb bound to alkaline phosphatase (bovine), diluted in
phosphate buffer, protein (bovine), < 0.1% sodium azide and 0.1% ProClin 300
K223921 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
Materials needed but not supplied with reagent kit
• Access CEA Calibrators: at zero and approximately 1, 10, 100, 500 and 1,000 ng/mL
• Access CEA QC controls: at approximately 3 and 300 ng/mL
• Commercial control material
• Lumi-Phos PRO substrate
• UniCel DxI Wash Buffer II
• Access CEA Diluent (optional)
The modification of the Access CEA includes:
(a) to replace substrate (Lumi-Phos 530) of the Access CEA with a new substrate (Lumi-
Phos PRO)
(b) to run on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer with the update the analytical
measuring interval of 0.2 – 1,000 ng/mL
B Principle of Operation:
The Access CEA assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic “sandwich” assay using two mouse
monoclonal anti-CEA antibodies (MAb) which react with different epitopes of CEA. A sample is
added to a reaction vessel, along with the first anti-CEA MAb-alkaline phosphatase conjugate
and the second anti-CEA MAb bound to paramagnetic particles. After incubation, materials
bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away.
Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is
measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration
of analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically determined from a stored
calibration.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the modified Access CEA was performed in accordance with CLSI guideline
EP06 2nd Edition. Two series of samples were prepared by mixing two High samples with
Low sample span the ‘analytical measuring interval’ (AMI) of the modified Access CEA and
to provide eight dilution levels. Low sample was obtained from a single human serum sample
that was specifically stripped of CEA antigen to achieve a concentration below the low end
of the AMI of the assay. Two High samples were pooled human serum with CEA
concentrations of 38.63 ng/mL and 1042.74 ng/mL. The low sample in the two series was run
in replicates of eight, and all other dilution levels were run in replicates of four, and the
‘measured value’ (mean CEA ng/mL) was compared to its predicted value for deviation
percentage using a weighted linear regression analysis. This deviation was then compared to
the allowable deviation from linearity (ADL). The results are summarized in table below.

The data support the linearity interval from 0.1 to 1042.7 ng/mL with the deviations from
linearity within ±10%. The study results support the linearity of the claimed analytical
measuring interval (AMI): 0.2 – 1,000 ng/mL.
3. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range is the same as the claimed measuring range: 0.2 to 1,000 ng/mL.
4. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability:
The traceability was established in K991707.
b) Stability:
The Access CEA Reagent kit and the Lumi-Phos PRO substrate are packaged separately.
The proposed change is to replace substrate (Lumi-Phos 530) of the Access CEA with a
new substrate (Lumi-Phos PRO). The shelf-life claims and on-board stability claims of
Lumi-Phos PRO substrate were established in K221225.
Access CEA Reagent kit stability was established in K991707. The real-time stability
study was conducted to verity the stability claims for the modified Access CEA. The
results support the shelf-life of 12 months for the reagent pack stored at 2-10°C.
5. Detection Capability:
CLSI guideline EP17-A2 were followed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of
Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the modified Access CEA on DxI 9000
Access Immunoassay Analyzer.
LoB:
Four blank samples (individual native serum samples from which CEA antigen was
specifically depleted) were tested in five replicates per run, one run per day over three days
using two modified Access CEA reagent lots (N = 60 replicates for each lot) on two DxI
9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers. The LoB for each reagent lot was calculated using the
non-parametric approach and the maximum observed LoB is taken as the reported value for

the measurement procedure. LoB determined using the 95% non-parametric percentile of the
replicates for each of the two reagent lots was 0.09 ng/mL and 0.03 ng/mL. The claimed LoB
for the modified Access CEA on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.09 ng/mL.
LoD:
Five to seven serum samples containing low levels of CEA analyte were run in nine
replicates per run, one run per day over five days using three modified Access CEA reagent
lots (N = minimum 225 replicates for each lot) on three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
Analyzers. The LoD was determined by fitting the precision profile model between within-
laboratory SD and concentration. LoD calculated from LoB + “SD multiplied by the 95th
percentile of the standard normal distribution” resulted in 0.1 ng/mL for each reagent lot. The
claimed LoD for the modified Access CEA on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is
0.1 ng/mL.
LoQ:
Nine to eleven serum samples containing low levels of CEA analyte were run in nine
replicates of per run, one run per day over five days using three modified Access CEA
reagent lots (N=minimum 405 replicates for each lot) on three DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzers. A variance components model was used to estimate the within-run
and within-laboratory (total) %CV for each sample on each instrument and reagent lot
combination. The LoQ was set to be the CEA concentration which met the within-laboratory
imprecision of 20% CV. The claimed LoQ for the modified Access CEA on DxI 9000
Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.2 ng/mL.

Not applicable
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
CLSI guideline EP09c 3rd Edition were followed to compare the modified Access CEA on
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer to the predicate device, the Access CEA on the
Access 2 Immunoassay System. Patient samples falling within the analytical measuring
interval of the Access CEA assay were evaluated. A total of 153 deidentified serum samples
were tested with three Access CEA reagent lots and three calibrator lots, using one Lumi-
Phos PRO substrate lots on three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers (candidate) and
using one Access Substrate lots on three Access 2 instruments (predicate). Two commercial
quality controls were run in duplicate each day to verify the systems were in control. The
comparison between paired measurements was analyzed using Passing-Bablok method by
fitting the observed modified Access CEA Assay on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
Analyzer (dependent variable, y) into a linear regression model, with the observed values
from the predicate (x, predicate). The results are summarized in the following table:
