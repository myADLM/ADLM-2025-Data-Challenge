IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube includes a screw-cap tube containing transport medium
which is divided into two formats – in kit and tube.
The format in kit is supplied in pre-packaged collection sets containing one of the two swab
types:
1. Minitip (2.5 mm tip) flocking swab with 8 cm breaking point, for nasopharyngeal
specimen collection
2. Regular (5 mm tip) flocking swab with 3 cm breaking point, for oropharyngeal specimen
collection
The screw-cap tube in kit format is pre-filled with 1 or 3 mL of transport medium for safe
transportation of biological specimen. The format in tube only contains labeled screw-cap tubes
pre-filled with 1 mL, 1.5mL, 2 mL, and 3 mL of transport medium.
The different configurations of BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube are provided in table 1.

B Principle of Operation:
The BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube is used to safely collect and transport of clinical
specimens containing viruses or chlamydiae from collection sites to the testing laboratories. The
transport media is packaged alone or with one of two swabs. Swabs are comprised of a solid
molded plastic applicator shaft and the tip of the applicator is flocked and either a regular (5 mm)
tip or a mini (2.5 mm) tip. After collecting specimens using the swab, the swab is put into the
preservation tube for storage and transportation, and subsequent testing. Sample collection is
intended to be used by health care professionals. The BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube
medium is composed of Hank’s balanced salt solution, bovine serum albumin, glucose and the
pH are buffered with HEPES buffer. Phenol red is used to indicate pH. Gentamicin and
amphotericin B are incorporated into the medium to inhibit competing bacteria and fungi. The
medium is isotonic and has been shown to be non-toxic to mammalian host cells.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Shelf-life Stability:
The shelf life for the BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube was determined to be 18
months from the date of manufacture when stored at temperature 2 – 25°C. The shelf life of
the BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube was established using real-time aging
performance test at time points T = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months. Three lots of the BioSci
Disposable Virus Sampling Tube were evaluated for appearance, net content, pH value,
bacteriostasis, sterility and recovery study at each time point in the real-time aging
performance test.
a. Shelf-Life, Appearance, Net content, and pH Value:
The shelf-life stability was conducted by visual inspection with the following criteria: the
package should be intact without damage and no leakage of liquid; the media should
appear to be a red and transparent without any color change, turbidity, or obvious
precipitation. All lots tested at each time point passed the criteria for appearance.
Net content stability was evaluated by measuring the volume of transport medium. The
net content should not be less than the labeled volume. All the tubes tested in time points
(1, 3, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months) meet the criteria for volume content. The pH stability of
the transport medium was determined through testing of five replicates from each lot at
each of the following time points (1, 3, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months). For all the tubes at
each time point, the pH was within the predefined pH range of 7.3 ± 0.3.
b. Sterility:
The BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube is not claimed to be sterile nor is it intended
to be sterilized by the end user. To decrease the chances of contamination the screw-cap
tubes are sterilized by e-beam irradiation and the transport medium is filled aseptically
under control conditions.
The results for appearance, net content, and pH value, collectively support the claim for 18
months of storage for the BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube at 2 – 25°C.

Performance Testing - Recovery Studies:
K230035 - Page 5 of 8

--- Page 6 ---
Performance of the BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube was evaluated by Culture-Based
Recovery Studies for viruses and chlamydiae. For Viral Recovery Studies, Fluorescent Foci
Count method was utilized to evaluate the recovery of Adenovirus (ATCC VR-1),
Cytomegalovirus (ATCC VR-977), Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (ATCC VR-260) and
Influenza A (ATCC VR-1736). This method was also utilized to evaluate the recovery of
Chlamydia pneumoniae (ATCC VR-1360). Performance evaluation was carried out in four
lots of media that represent newly manufactured media and older media (about to expire or
recently expired).
Virus stocks were diluted into two different dilutions in pooled negative clinical matrix and
each dilution was inoculated into swab in triplicate and placed into BioSci Disposable Virus
Sampling Tube to store at 2 - 8ºC and 20 - 25ºC for 0 and 48 hours respectively. At each time
point following inoculation, each sample was vortexed, and an aliquot was taken for recovery
study using suitable tissue culture medium and host cells. For tissue culture, host cells were
seeded in a 96-well plate and allowed to adhere for 24 – 48 hours. MRC-5 cells (SCSP-5040)
were used for Adenovirus and Cytomegalovirus, Vero cells (GNO10) for Herpes Simplex
Virus Type 1, and MDCK cells (GNO23) for Influenza A. Aliquot of 100 microliter (µL)
virus suspensions prepared in gradient dilutions in triplicate were added on the monolayer
plate. After incubation, specific immunofluorescent antibody staining was used for detection.
For Chlamydia recovery, McCoy cells (ATCC CRL-1696) were used.
The number of infectious particles were counted as Fluorescent Foci and average recovery
was calculated as mean of foci count per inoculum volume into 96-well plate (0.05 mL) for
each storage temperature and time points. The changes (any increase or decrease) in the
recovery between timepoints (0 to 48 hr) were presented in percent values (negative for
decrease and positive for increase). Any change that was within one log difference (+/-90%)
was considered acceptable. Results were combined for all the lots irrespective of age as all
changes were acceptable. The results are presented in the Table 2 and 3.

Conclusion: The BioSci Disposable Virus Sampling Tube demonstrated the recovery of
tested viruses at an acceptable rate (Adenovirus, Cytomegalovirus, HSV Type 1 and
Influenza A), and Chlamydia pneumoniae at 4oC and 25oC up to 48 hours. Based on these
results, the following statement was added to the package insert.
• Better recovery of viruses and chlamydiae are achieved when specimens are processed shortly
after the time of collection and within 48 hours of collection when transported at 4°C compared
to 25°C.
