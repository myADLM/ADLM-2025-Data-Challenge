D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The MissLan® Pregnancy Rapid Test (Strip) and MissLan® Pregnancy Rapid Test (Midstream)
are lateral flow immunoassays for the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The
test strip format is packaged as a single test strip sealed in a desiccated aluminum pouch, with a
urine collection cup and instructions for use. The midstream format is a test strip assembled in a
plastic housing with an absorbent tip and is packaged as a single test sealed in a desiccated
aluminum pouch with instructions for use. The result is displayed within the “test window” by
two distinct colored lines, one control line and one test line.
B Principle of Operation:
The MissLan® Pregnancy Rapid Test (Strip) and MissLan® Pregnancy Rapid Test (Midstream)
use a lateral flow immunoassay to detect hCG, in human urine. The test comes in two formats; 1)
Midstream, in which a user can apply a specimen by keeping the absorbent tip in a urine mid-
stream for five (5) to ten (10) seconds or by dipping the entire absorbent tip into urine collected
in a cup for five (5) to ten (10) seconds; and 2) test strip format, in which a user dips the sample
pad into urine collected in a cup for five (5) seconds.
After application of the urine specimen, the hCG within the urine reacts with the anti-βhCG
K230038 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
antibody-colloidal gold conjugate to form a compound. The compound is captured by the anti-
αhCG antibody immobilized on the test area, then a colored line will form on the test area (i.e.,
test line). A colored line will always develop in the control zone “C” (i.e., control line) if
sufficient sample volume has been applied to the test strip. The test result is shown in the result
window and read visually between 3 and 5 minutes of urine application. Two distinct colored
lines, one in the test zone and another in the control zone indicate a positive test result
(pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the test zone and only a colored line in the control zone
indicates a negative test result (not pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the control zone, even
in the presence of a colored line in the test zone, indicates an invalid test result.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A pooled urine sample from non-pregnant females (negative) was spiked with hCG to
provide nine urine samples with hCG concentrations of 0, 12.5, 15, 18.75, 22.5, 25, 50, 100
and 200 mIU/mL. Each sample was tested using 3 lots of the MissLan® Pregnancy Rapid
Test (Strip) and 3 lots of the MissLan® Pregnancy Rapid Test (Midstream). Testing on the
midstream format was performed using both the mid-stream sampling method and dip
sampling method. The tests were performed in replicates of 10, over the course of 5 non-
consecutive days by 3 different operators for each sample concentration. A total of 150 tests
per concentration were performed per tested sampling method. The device cut-off is 25
mIU/mL hCG.

2. Linearity:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-Reactivity:
The candidate devices were tested for potential cross-reactivity from luteinizing hormone
(LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Urine
specimens from non-pregnant females were pooled and used to prepare samples with hCG
levels of 0 mIU/mL, 5 mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL that were then spiked with each cross
reactant at the following concentrations: 500 mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH, and 1000
mIU/mL TSH. Samples were tested in replicates of 3 with 3 lots of the candidate devices.
The results demonstrated no cross reactivity at the LH, FSH and TSH concentrations tested
in either negative or positive urine samples.

Interference Study:
To evaluate potential interference for the MissLan® Pregnancy Rapid Test (Strip) and the
MissLan® Pregnancy Rapid Test (Midstream), a urine pool from non-pregnant females was
used to prepare samples with hCG levels of 0 mIU/mL, 5 mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL that were
then spiked with potentially interfering exogenous and endogenous substances (test samples).
Samples were tested in 3 replicates on 3 lots by 3 operators on the candidate devices. The
results demonstrated no interference from substances at the concentrations shown in the table
below.

Effect of hCG β-core fragment:
Urine samples from non-pregnant females (negative) (0 and 5 mIU/mL hCG) were used to
prepare samples with hCG levels of 25 mIU/mL and 20,000 mIU/mL. Samples were spiked
with hCG β-core fragment at concentrations of 50,000 pmol/L, 125,000 pmol/L, 250,000
pmol/L and 500,000 pmol/L. The results demonstrated that the candidate devices are not
affected by concentrations of hCG β-core fragment up to 500,000 pmol/L.
Effect of urine pH:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in urine pH, urine samples containing 0
mIU/mL, 5 mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL hCG were adjusted to pH values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0,
8.0 and 9.0 and tested using the candidate devices. The results demonstrated that changes in
pH ranging from 4.0 to 9.0 do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the
devices.
Effect of urine specific gravity:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, urine samples containing
0 mIU/mL, 5 mIU/mL, and 25 mIU/mL hCG were adjusted to specific gravities of 1.000,
1.005, 1.010, 1.020, 1.030 and 1.035. The results demonstrated that changes in specific
gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.035 do not interfere with either positive or negative results
from the devices.
High dose hook effect study:
Pooled urine samples from non-pregnant females (negative) were spiked with varying hCG
concentrations (6,250, 12,500, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, and 500,000 mIU/mL) and
tested on 3 lots of the candidate devices. No hook effect was observed at concentrations up to
500,000 mIU/mL hCG.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
MissLan® Pregnancy Rapid Test (Strip) and MissLan® Pregnancy Rapid Test (Midstream)
are calibrated against reference material traceable to WHO International Standard 5th edition,
NIBSC code 07/364.
6. Detection Limit:
The detection limit was determined in the precision study (see Section VII.A.1. above).
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The device’s cut-off is 25 mIU/mL. See Precision/Reproducibility (Section VII.A.1.) section
above.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A total of 200 urine samples were collected from women whose ages ranged from 18 to 45
years, who presented to 3 clinics for pregnancy testing. Approximately half of the 200
women were suspected to be pregnant and most of them were in the early stages of
pregnancy (less than 5 weeks). The samples were masked and randomized prior to testing by
professionals using 3 lots of the candidate devices and a single lot of the predicate device
(One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test). One hundred (100) samples were tested using the
MissLan® Pregnancy Rapid Test (Midstream) in each sampling mode (100 of the samples
were tested in the dip sampling mode and the other 100 samples were tested in mid-stream
sampling mode), and all 200 urines samples were tested using the MissLan® Pregnancy
Rapid Test (Strip). A summary of the results is presented in the tables below:

a. Lay-User Study:
A lay user study was conducted at 3 sites with 200 volunteers with diverse educational
and occupational backgrounds who were between the ages of 18 and 45. This included
100 lay-users using the MissLan® Pregnancy Rapid Test (Strip) and 100 lay-users using
the MissLan® Pregnancy Rapid Test (Midstream), split between 50 users performing
dip-test sampling and 50 users performing mid-stream sampling. The lay-users tested
their own urine sample and also provided a sample for professional testing. Ease of use of
the candidate devices was assessed through a questionnaire that was completed at the end
of the study. The questionnaire results indicated that lay-users found the tests easy to use,
the results clear and easy to read and the instructions for use easy to understand. The data
shows that the agreement between lay-user results and professional results was 100%
