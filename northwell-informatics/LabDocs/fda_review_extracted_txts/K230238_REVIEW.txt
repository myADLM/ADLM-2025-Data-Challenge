IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BIOEASY™ U-Catch MAX Multi-Drug Test Cup and the BIOEASY™ U-Catch MAX
Multi-Drug Test Cup Rx are immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for
the qualitative detection of target drugs and drug metabolites in human urine. The products are
single-use in vitro diagnostic devices. The candidate device contains a Cup device, a package
insert and a urine cup for sample collection. Each test device is sealed with a desiccant in an
aluminum pouch.
The BIOEASY™ U-Catch MAX Multi-Drug Test Cup (OTC use) detects all analytes listed
above except 6-Acetylmorphine.
K230238 - Page 4 of 21

--- Page 5 ---
The BIOEASY™ U-Catch MAX Multi-Drug Test Cup Rx (Prescription Use) detects all analytes
listed above.
B Principle of Operation:
The candidate devices are rapid tests for the qualitative detection of target drugs and drug
metabolites in urine samples. The tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. During
testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target drugs present in the urine
specimen are below the cutoff concentration, it will not saturate the binding sites of its specific
monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be
captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line
region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the target drug level exceeds its
cutoff concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the
particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices regardless of the presence of
drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been performed properly.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cutoff, - 75%
cutoff, -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff, cutoff, +25% cutoff, +50% cutoff, +75% cutoff and +100%
cutoff. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in negative urine samples. Each drug
concentration was confirmed by LC/MS. All sample aliquots were tested in a blinded
fashion. For each concentration, tests were performed in two runs per day for 25 days per
device in a randomized order using 3 reagent lots. The results obtained are summarized in the
following tables for Amphetamine 500, Cocaine 150, Methamphetamine 500, 2- ethylidene-
1, 5-dimethyl-3, 3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), and 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM). The data for
Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Secobarbital, Oxazepam, Morphine,
Methadone, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, d-Propoxyphene, Nortriptyline and Cannabinoids
were previously reported in K182530.

Interfering substances:
Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological
conditions were added to drug-free urine and urine samples with concentrations of the target
drugs at 25% below and 25% above cutoff levels. These urine samples were tested using
three lots of each device. The compounds were tested at 100 ug/mL (unless otherwise noted
in the table). No interference was observed for any of the compounds tested, and the list of
compounds is provided in the following table.

Effect of Urinary Specific Gravity and pH:
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples, with specific
gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.035 or urine samples with pH ranging from 4 to 9 were
spiked with the target drugs to concentrations at 25% below and 25% above cutoff levels.
These samples were tested using three lots of each device. Results were all positive for
samples at +25% cutoff and all negative for samples at -25% cutoff.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The device is traceable to commercially available reference materials.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies for the BIOEASY U-Catch MAX Multi-Drug Test Cup Rx were
performed by three operators. Eighty (80) unaltered clinical samples were run for each target
drug. The samples were tested in a blinded fashion and compared to LC/MS results. The
results are presented in the tables below for Amphetamine 500, Cocaine 150,
Methamphetamine 500, 2-ethylidene-1, 5-dimethyl-3, 3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), and 6-
acetylmorphine (6-AM). The data for Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
Secobarbital, Oxazepam, Morphine, Methadone, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, d-
Propoxyphene, Nortriptyline and Cannabinoids were previously reported in K182530.

Lay user study
A lay user study was performed using the BIOEASY U-Catch MAX Multi-Drug Test Cup at
three intended use sites with 140 lay persons. The lay users had diverse ages and educational
and professional backgrounds. Urine samples were prepared at multiple concentrations
(Negative (-100%), +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff) by spiking drugs into drug free
pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each
sample was aliquoted into individual containers and tested in a blinded fashion. Each
participant was provided with the package insert, one blind-labeled sample and a device, and
no additional training. Summary results are shown below:
