IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The candidate device is for the sodium and potassium tests on the i-STAT CG8+ (white)
cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System. Additional analytes on the i-STAT CG8+ cartridge (white)
with the i-STAT 1 System were cleared in K223710 (glucose), K230285 (pH, pCO2, pO2) and
K230300 (ionized calcium and hematocrit).
The i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge contains sensors for the measurement of sodium and
potassium, a fluid pouch containing aqueous calibrator, a sample entry well and snap closure,
fluid channels, waste chamber, and the necessary mechanical features for controlled fluid
movement within cartridge. It is a single-use disposable unit that is self-contained. The cartridge
tests a sample consisting of two or three drops of whole blood (95 µL). All the test steps and
fluid movement occur within the i-STAT CG8+ cartridges.
B Principle of Operation:
Sodium and Potassium tests on the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge are measured by ion-
selective electrode potentiometry, measurement of potential difference between the ion selective
electrode and the reference electrode. In the calculation of concentration is related to potential
through the Nernst equation.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
i-STAT CG8+ cartridge (white) cartridge contains multiple assays. When a cartridge generated a
star-out (non-reported result) for one assay, an additional cartridge was run to replace the star-out
result, which produced additional test results for other assays. Therefore, the number of replicates
per sample in the following precision/reproducibility studies may vary.

2. Linearity:
The linearity study was designed based on the CLSI EP06 2nd ed guideline. Lithium heparin
venous whole blood was obtained from a healthy subject and was altered to produce a high
sample pool and a low sample pool. Samples of intermediate concentrations were prepared
by intermixing the high and low pools. A total of eleven (11) samples were prepared for the
linearity assessment with the concentrations spanning the claimed measuring range using five
CG8+ cartridge lot. Each test sample was tested in replicates of two (2) per cartridge lot for a
total of ten (10) results per level. An assessment of linearity was performed using weighted
least squares linear regression. At each concentration level, the deviation from linearity was
within ± 0.6% for i-STAT Sodium test and within ± 3% for i-STAT Potassium test. The
regression parameters for the linearity study are summarized below:
Range tested Claimed Measuring

(mmol/L) Range (mmol/L)
Na 91.3 – 209.8 100 - 180 mmol/L 1.005 -0.525 0.9996
K 1.79 – 10.04 2.0 – 9.0 mmol/L 1.011 0.002 0.9994
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the sodium and potassium assays on the i-STAT CG8+ (white)
cartridge using the i-STAT 1 system was established by conducting interference testing
following the recommendations in CLSI EP07-Edition 3. Interference from certain
exogenous and endogenous substances was assessed using lithium heparin venous whole
blood samples. A substance was identified as an interferent if the difference in the mean
between the control and test sample was outside of the predefined allowable error:
For Sodium: ± 4 mmol/L.
For Potassium: ± 0.5 mmol/L.
The following table lists the concentrations of each substance at which no significant
interference was found:

For those substances that on initial screening were found to interfere, dose response testing
was conducted to establish the concentration limit below which no significant interference is
expected. The results are given in the table below:
Test Substance Concentration Interference
Cholesterol ≥ 425mg/dL Decreased results
Sodium
Nithiodote (Sodium Thiosulfate) ≥ 2.7 mmol/L Increased results
Limitations included in the labeling
Bromide at 2.5 mmol/L is the peak plasma concentration associated with halothane
o
anesthesia, in which bromide is released. Bromide may result in an increased rate of
star outs (***).
Nithiodote (Sodium Thiosulfate) is indicated for the treatment of acute cyanide
o
poisoning. The journal article [1] titled “Falsely increased chloride and missed anion
gap elevation during treatment with sodium thiosulfate” indicated that sodium
thiosulfate could be used in the treatment of calciphylaxis indicating that the highest
concentration likely to be seen in plasma [is] after infusion of a 12.5 g dose of sodium
thiosulfate pentahydrate. Assuming that the 12.5 g dose of sodium thiosulfate
pentahydrate is distributed in a typical blood volume of 5 L with a hematocrit of 40%,
the peak sodium thiosulfate plasma concentration expected is 16.7 mmol/L.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
See section VII. A.2 Linearity.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The i-STAT sodium and potassium tests on the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge are traceable
to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard reference
material NIST SRM956.
Sample Stability
A study was conducted to verify the whole blood sample stability after sample collection
with and without anticoagulant for the i-STAT sodium and potassium tests using the i-STAT
CG8+ (white) cartridge on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer. The results support the sponsor’s sample
stability claims. The sample stability claims for sodium and potassium tests are 30 minutes
for (arterial, venous) samples with anticoagulant and 3 minutes for (arterial and venous)
samples without anticoagulant. The sample stability claims for sodium is 3 minutes for
capillary whole blood samples with anticoagulant.

6. Detection Limit:
Linearity studies were used to support the lower end of the measuring range for i-STAT
sodium and potassium tests (see section VII. A.2 above). In addition, a limit of quantitation
(LoQ) study for each analyte on the i-STAT CG8+(white) cartridge with the i-STAT 1
Analyzer was conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2.
The LoQ was evaluated using lithium heparin venous whole blood altered to create four (4)
samples with low sodium or potassium concentrations. Each sample was evaluated using two
i-STAT CG8+ cartridge (white) lots. The LoQ was calculated for each of the two lots. The
sponsor defined LoQ as the lowest concentration that met the pre-defined total error goal
listed in the table below for each analyte. The sponsor based the claim on the lot with the
highest LoQ estimate. The results are summarized in the table below.
Analyte Reportable Range Total Error (TE) LoQ
Na 100 – 180 mmol/L ≤ 4 mmol/L 92 mmol/L
K 2 – 9.0 mmol/L ≤ 0.5 mmol/L 1.6 mmol/L
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The accuracy of the i-STAT sodium and potassium test with the i-STAT CG8+ cartridge
(white) on the i-STAT 1 analyzer was evaluated by a method comparison study for
agreement with the comparative methods. The study was conducted following the
recommendations in CLSI EP09c-3rd ed. guideline.
A total of 185 lithium heparin arterial whole blood specimen and 157 lithium heparin venous
whole blood (5% contrived venous blood samples) specimens collected across three (3) point
of care sites were evaluated for sodium and potassium using the i-STAT CG8+ cartridge
(white) and i-STAT CHEM8+cartridge (comparative method) on the i-STAT 1 analyzer. The
data were analyzed by Passing-Bablok regression analysis comparing the first replicate of the
i-STAT CG8+ cartridge to the mean of duplicate results from the comparative method.
Accuracy results for arterial and venous whole blood specimens for each analyte are shown
in the table below.

Capillary whole blood specimen (including 22 neonate samples) collected from skin
punctures with balanced heparin capillary tubes from each study subject across multiple point
of care sites were tested for Na using the i-STAT CG8+ cartridge (white) on the i-STAT 1
analyzer and the epoc Blood Analysis System (comparative method). A Passing-Bablok
linear regression analysis was performed using the singlicate result from the i-STAT CG8+
cartridge (white) versus the singlicate result of the comparative method. Accuracy results for
the capillary whole blood specimen are shown in the table below.

cleared sodium and potassium test systems.
2. Matrix Comparison:
The sponsor has provided the information to support that the sodium and potassium in the i-
STAT CG8+ cartridge (white) on the i-STAT 1 System can be performed using balanced
heparin, lithium heparin and non-anticoagulant venous and arterial whole blood. The sodium
assay can also be used for testing heparinized capillary whole blood.
