IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT CG8+ cartridge is used with the i-STAT 1 analyzer as part of the i-STAT 1 System.
The single-use, disposable i-STAT CG8+ cartridge contain the required sensors, a fluid pack
(calibrant pouch), a sample entry well and closure, fluid channels, waste chamber, and the
necessary mechanical features for controlled fluid movement within cartridge. The i-STAT
cartridge format allows all the tests in the cartridge to be performed simultaneously. All the test
steps and fluid movement occur within the i-STAT CG8+ cartridge. Cartridges require two to
three drops of whole blood (95µL) to be run on the analyzer.
The candidate device is for the use of pH, pO2, and pCO2 detection on the i-STAT CG8+
cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System. Additional analytes on the i-STAT CG8+ cartridge with
the i-STAT 1 System were cleared in K223710 (glucose), K230300 (ionized calcium and
hematocrit), and K230275 (sodium and potassium).
B Principle of Operation:
pH is measured by direct potentiometry. In the calculation of results for pH, concentration is
related to potential through the Nernst equation.
pO2 is measured amperometrically. The oxygen sensor is similar to a conventional Clark
electrode. Oxygen permeates through a gas permeable membrane from the blood sample into an
internal electrolyte solution where it is reduced at the cathode. The oxygen reduction current is
proportional to the dissolved oxygen concentration.
pCO2 is measured by direct potentiometry. In the calculation of results for pCO2, concentration
is related to potential through the Nernst equation.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Internal within-site precision (aqueous control material):
A single site precision study for the candidate test was conducted following the
recommendations in CLSI EP05-A3. Up to five concentration levels of commercially
available calibration verification samples were tested using one lot of i-STAT CG8+ (white)
cartridges and ten i-STAT 1 Analyzers. Each sample was measured in duplicates per run,
with two runs per day for 20-days by two operators resulting in a total of 80 test results per
level. The results are summarized below.

Point of Care precision (aqueous control material):
A multi-day precision study was performed at three sites using aqueous solutions of pH, pO2,
and pCO2. At each site, each level was tested once a day by two operators for five days on six i-
STAT 1 analyzers using i-STAT CG8+ cartridges, resulting in a total of at least 90 test results
per level. When a cartridge generated a star-out (non-reported result) for one assay, an additional
cartridge was run to replace the star-out result, which produced additional test results. Within-
day, between-day and total variance components were calculated by site. These components
were also calculated for all sites combined and provided in the tables below:

Point of Care Precision (Whole Blood)
A multi-site precision study was conducted using arterial, venous, and capillary whole blood
specimens collected with lithium heparin collection devices targeted to levels within the
reportable range of the pH, pO2, and pCO2 tests. The whole blood precision was assessed using
the duplicate test results collected across multiple point of care sites. For each sample type,
samples were grouped into subintervals based on their mean values. The precision results
between sites were similar. The combined results of the whole blood precision are shown below:

*Precision for capillary whole blood for pO2 sample range 50-70 mmHg is as follows:
Mean=61.3 mmHg, SD (95% CI)=4.72 mmHg (4.05, 5.64), %CV (95% CI)=7.69 (6.61, 9.21).
2. Linearity:
The linearity study was designed based on CLSI EP06-Edition 2. The linearity of the i-STAT
pH, pO2, and pCO2 tests in the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System was
evaluated by preparing venous whole blood samples collected in lithium heparin tubes from
healthy subjects of varying analyte levels for each i-STAT test. Each sample for pO2, pCO2, and
pH testing was prepared via tonometry to eleven target analyte concentrations. Each test sample
was tested in replicates of 3 per cartridge lot for a total of 15 results per level. Each level was
tested using 5 lots of i-STAT CG8+ cartridges. The linearity study results support that the assays
are linear across the following claimed reportable ranges:

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the pO2, pCO2, and pH tests of the i-STAT CG8+ (white)
cartridges using the i-STAT 1 system was established by conducting interference testing
following the recommendations in CLSI EP07-Edition 3. Interference from certain
exogenous and endogenous substances was assessed using lithium heparin venous whole
blood samples tonometered to two concentrations of low and high samples: pO2 (20-40
mmHg and 55-95 mmHg), pCO2 (20-40 mmHg and 60-80 mmHg), and pH (7.2-7.4 and 7.3-
7.5). Each low and high sample was further divided into two aliquots: control (with no added
interferent) and test (with added interferent). Each sample was measured in replicates of 10
using two lots of the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridges. A substance was identified as an
interferent if the difference in the mean between the control and test sample was outside of
the predefined allowable error:
For pO2: ± greater of 5 mmHg or 10% of the control (mmHg)
For pCO2: ± greater of 5 mmHg or 8% of the control (mmHg)
For pH: ± 0.04 pH units
The following table lists the concentrations of each substance at which no significant
interference was found.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
pH: Traceable to NIST SRM 185, 185, and 187 reference materials via the IFCC blood
reference method.
pO2: Traceable to U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard
reference materials via commercially available certified specialty medical gas standards.
pCO2: Traceable to U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard
reference materials via commercially available certified specialty medical gas standards.
Sample stability
A study was conducted to verify the whole blood sample stability after sample collection
with anticoagulant for i-STAT pO2, pCO2, and pH tests using the i-STAT CG8+ (white)
cartridges on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer. The results support the sponsor’s sample stability
claims. The sample stability claims for pO2, pCO2, and pH are 10 minutes for arterial and
venous samples and three minutes for capillary samples with lithium heparin anticoagulant.
Venous and arterial samples are stable for up to three minutes without anticoagulant.
The device performed adequately at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet.
6. Detection Limit:
Linearity studies were used to support the lower end of the measuring range for pH, pO2, and
pCO2 (see section VII.A.2. above). In addition, to support the limit of quantitation (LoQ) a
study was performed according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ of the i-STAT pH, pO2, and
pCO2 tests in the i-STAT CG8+ cartridge was evaluated on the i-STAT 1 analyzer using two
i-STAT CG8+ cartridge lots, and whole blood that was altered using tonometry to low pH (≤
6.5 pH units), pO2 (≤ 10.00 mmHg), pCO2 (≤5.000 mmHg). The LoQ for each test is shown
below.

B Comparison Studies:
Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison for arterial, venous, and capillary whole blood specimens on the i-STAT
CG8+ cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System was performed based on CLSI EP09c-ED3. Lithium
heparin arterial and venous whole blood specimens collected across point of care sites were
evaluated using i-STAT CG8+ cartridges on the i-STAT 1 analyzer and compared to whole
blood specimens tested on a comparative method. Capillary whole blood specimens collected
with balanced heparin capillary tubes from multiple point of care sites were evaluated and
analyzed in singlicate on the i‑STAT 1 analyzer against the comparative method. For pH, pO2,

Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP35 to
evaluate the performance of the i-STAT pH, pCO2, and pO2 tests on the i-STAT 1 System
using non-anticoagulated venous and arterial whole blood specimens (i.e. candidate specimen
type), and comparing them to samples collected with heparin anticoagulant (primary
specimen type). A total of 241 whole blood samples tested include, native venous (n=106)
and native arterial (n=135) specimens. Each specimen was tested in duplicate using two i-
STAT CG8+ cartridges with two i-STAT 1 analyzers. A Passing-Bablok linear regression
analysis was performed using the first replicate result from the candidate (y-axis) versus the
mean result from the primary specimen (x-axis). The assay can also be used for testing
heparinized capillary whole blood samples. The regression analysis results are summarized
