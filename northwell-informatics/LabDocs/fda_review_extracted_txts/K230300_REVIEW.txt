IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge is used with the i-STAT 1 analyzer as part of the i-STAT 1
System.
The single-use, disposable i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge contain the required sensors, a fluid
pack (calibrant pouch), a sample entry well and closure, fluid channels, waste chamber, and the
necessary mechanical features for controlled fluid movement within cartridge. The i-STAT
cartridge format allows all the tests in the cartridge to be performed simultaneously. All the test
steps and fluid movement occur within the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge. Cartridges require
two to three drops of whole blood (95µL) to be run on the analyzer.
The candidate device is for the calcium and hematocrit analytes on the i-STAT CG8+ (white)
cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System. Additional analytes on the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge

--- Page 3 ---
with the i-STAT 1 System were cleared in K223710 (glucose), K230285 (pH, pCO2, pO2), and
K230275 (sodium and potassium).
B Principle of Operation:
Ionized Calcium (iCa) on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge is measured by ion-selective electrode
potentiometry; measurement of potential difference between the ion selective electrode and the
reference electrode. In the calculation of concentration is related to potential through the Nernst
equation.
Hematocrit (Hct) on the i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge is measured by the conductivity method.
Conductivity of the sample is inversely proportional to the concentration of red blood cells in the
sample. The hematocrit sensor first measures the electrical conductivity of the calibrant solution,
followed by the conductivity of the whole blood sample. The conductivity of the sample is also a
function of the plasma electrolyte concentration. The i-STAT Hematocrit test algorithm uses the
sodium concentration in the calculation of the test result.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Internal within-laboratory precision (aqueous control material)
A single site precision study was conducted using five concentration levels of commercially
available calibration verification (CalVer) samples that were tested using one lot of the i-
STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge and ten i-STAT 1 Analyzers. The precision of the i-STAT
Ionized Calcium test was evaluated using five (5) levels of aqueous materials and the
precision of the i-STAT Hematocrit (Hct) test was evaluated using four (4) levels of aqueous
materials. Each sample was measured in duplicates per run, with two runs per day over 20-
days by a minimum of two operators resulting in a total of 80 test results per level. When a
cartridge generated a star-out (non-reported result) for one assay, an additional cartridge was
run to replace the star-out result, which produced additional test results for other assays. The
results are summarized below.

Point of Care precision (aqueous control material)
A three-site precision study was performed using a panel of five levels of aqueous control
solutions, containing different levels of each analyte. At each site, testing was performed
once per day by two operators for five days and each operator performed the test on three
analyzers using one lot of the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge. When a cartridge generated a
star-out (non-reported result) for one assay, an additional cartridge was run to replace the star-out
result, which produced additional test results for other assays. Within-run, between-day,
between-operator and within-site (total) variance components were calculated by site. These
components were also calculated for all sites combined and are provided below. Lot-to-lot
and instrument-to-instrument precision was also evaluated and found to be acceptable.

Point of Care Precision (Whole Blood)
Whole blood precision for the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge on the i-STAT 1 System was
evaluated using arterial, venous, and capillary whole blood specimens collected with lithium
heparin for the hematocrit test and arterial and venous whole blood specimens collected with
lithium heparin for the ionized calcium test. The whole blood precision was assessed using
the duplicate test results collected across multiple point of care sites. The results of the whole
blood precision are shown below. The mean values for each sample were divided into
subintervals for each sample type across the reportable range for each i-STAT test. The

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the i-STAT Ionized Calcium and Hematocrit tests in the i-STAT CG8+
(white) cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System was evaluated by preparing whole blood
samples of varying HCT and iCa levels. The data demonstrated that the i-STAT Ionized
Calcium and Hematocrit tests in the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge are linear over the
reportable range for each i-STAT test. Summary of the results are provided below:
Test Units Reportable Range Range Tested Slope Intercept 2

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity of the i-STAT Ionized Calcium and Hematocrit tests in the i-STAT
CG8+ (white) cartridge was established following the recommendations in CLSI EP07-ED3.
Interference from certain exogenous and endogenous substances was assessed using lithium
heparin venous whole blood that was spiked with the analytes to two concentrations: Ionized
Calcium 1.05 – 1.25 mmol/L and 1.40 – 1.60 mmol/L; Hematocrit 26.5 – 31.5 % PCV and
57 – 63% PCV. Each low and high sample was further divided into two aliquots: control
(with no added interferent) and test (with added interferent). The effect of each substance
was evaluated by comparing the performance of a control sample, spiked with blank solvent
solution, with the test results from a test sample spiked with the potentially interfering
substance at the toxic/pathological concentration based on CLSI EP37-ED1. A substance was
identified as an interferent if the difference between the control and test samples was outside
of the allowable error (±Ea) for the i-STAT test. For an identified interferent, a dose-response
was performed to determine the degree of interference as a function of the substance
concentration. Each sample was measured in replicates of 10 using one lot each of the i-
STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge.
For Ionized Calcium the Ea was ± 0.5 mmol/L
For Hematocrit the Ea was ± 10.8% PCV
The following table lists the concentrations of each substance at which no significant
interference was found:

±The concentration of ionized calcium in blood is dependent on the pH of the specimen and
therefore is considered a factor affecting results
The sponsor included the following limitations in the labeling:
Bromide has been tested at two levels: a therapeutic plasma concentration level of 2.5
o
mmol/L and a toxic concentration of 37.5 mmol/L. 2.5 mmol/L is the peak plasma
concentration associated with halothane anesthesia, in which bromide is released. APOC
has not identified a therapeutic condition that would lead consistent with the toxic level
and suggests using another method for concentrations greater than 2.5 mmol/L.
Leflunomide is an isoxazole immunomodulatory agent that inhibits dihydroorotate
o
dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine synthesis, and that has
antiproliferative activity. It is used in the treatment of some immune diseases. Following
oral administration, leflunomide is metabolized to an active metabolite, teriflunomide,
which is responsible for essentially all its in vivo activity. The active metabolite
teriflunomide reaches a plasma concentration of 8.5 μg/mL (0.031 mmol/L) after a 100
mg loading dose and the steady state concentration is maintained at 63 μg/mL [6.3
mg/dL] (0.23 mmol/L) after 24 weeks of maintenance dose at 25 mg/day when treating
inflammatory polyarthropathy.
Nithiodote (Sodium Thiosulfate) is indicated for the treatment of acute cyanide
o
poisoning. The journal article titled “Falsely increased chloride and missed anion gap
elevation during treatment with sodium thiosulfate” indicated that sodium thiosulfate
could be used in the treatment of calciphylaxis indicating that the highest concentration
likely to be seen in plasma [is] after infusion of a 12.5 g dose of sodium thiosulfate
pentahydrate. Assuming that the 12.5 g dose of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate is
distributed in a typical blood volume of 5 L with a hematocrit of 40%, the peak sodium
thiosulfate plasma concentration expected is 16.7 mmol/L.
Thiocyanate is a major metabolite of cyanide produced in the liver. The cyanide
o
compound sodium nitroprusside may be used in emergency medical situations to produce
a rapid decrease in blood pressure in humans and most of the cyanide produced during
metabolism of sodium nitroprusside is eliminated in the form of thiocyanate.
Additionally, cyanide elimination is accelerated by the co-infusion of thiosulfate,
thiocyanate production is increased as in the case of thiosulphate treatment of cyanide
poisoning. The highest drug concentration under therapeutic treatment reported by CLSI
EP37 is 0.299 mmol/L. However, concentrations in patients receiving nitroprusside and
co-infusion of thiosulfate may be much higher. Thiocyanate is mildly neurotoxic
(tinnitus, miosis, hyperreflexia) at serum levels of 1 mmol/L. Thiocyanate toxicity is life-
threatening when levels are 3 or 4 times higher. Thiocyanate concentrations greater than
0.898 mmol/L will lead to falsely low ionized calcium results.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability
The i-STAT hematocrit and ionized calcium tests on the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge
are traceable to U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard
reference material.
b) Sample stability
A study was conducted to verify the whole blood sample stability after sample collection
for i-STAT Ionized Calcium and Hematocrit tests using the i-STAT CG8+ (white)
cartridges on the i-STAT 1 Analyzer. The results support the sponsor’s sample stability
claims. The sample stability study results support the i-STAT Ionized Calcium labeling
claims of 10 minutes for samples collected with anticoagulant and three (3) minutes for
samples collected without anticoagulant, and the i-STAT Hematocrit labeling claims of 30
minutes for samples collected with anticoagulant and three (3) minutes for samples
collected without anticoagulant.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB)
The LoB studies for the i-STAT Ionized Calcium (iCa) and Hematocrit (Hct) tests were
conducted over four days using two lots each of the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge on the i-
STAT 1 analyzer. Whole blood collected in lithium heparin tubes from four unique subjects
were altered to deplete ionized calcium and hematocrit levels. The LoB claim is based on the
maximal LoB value obtained for the cartridge lots tested for each test.
Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD studies for the i-STAT Ionized Calcium (iCa) and Hematocrit (Hct) tests were
conducted over four days using two lots of the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge on the i-
STAT 1 analyzer. Whole blood collected in lithium heparin tubes from four unique subjects
were altered to create two low-level ionized calcium samples and four low-level hematocrit
samples. The LoD was determined based on the maximal LoD value obtained for the
cartridge lots tested for each test.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The LoQ of the i-STAT Ionized Calcium and Hematocrit tests in the i-STAT CG8+ (white)
cartridge was evaluated on the i-STAT 1 analyzer using two (2) i-STAT CG8+ (white)
cartridge lots, and whole blood that was altered to a low analyte level for each i-STAT test.
The LoQ for the i-STAT Ionized Calcium and Hematocrit tests in the i-STAT CG8+ (white)
cartridge was determined to be at or below the lower limit of the reportable range for each
of the i-STAT tests.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study for the ionized calcium test (using arterial and venous whole
blood specimens) and the hematocrit test (using arterial, venous, and capillary whole blood
specimens) on the i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System was conducted
following the recommendations in CLSI EP09c-Ed3.
Lithium heparin whole blood specimens were collected across three point of care sites and
were evaluated using i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridges on the i-STAT 1 analyzer and were
evaluated using whole blood specimens tested on the comparator methods. For ionized
calcium and hematocrit, the first replicate result from the i-STAT 1 analyzer was compared
to the results from the comparative method.
Additionally for the hematocrit test, two (2) capillary whole blood specimens collected from
skin puncture with balanced heparin capillary tubes from each study subject across multiple
point of care sites were evaluated and analyzed in singlicate with the i-STAT CG8+ (white)
cartridges on the i‑STAT 1 analyzer and on the comparator method. A Passing-Bablok linear
regression analysis for hematocrit was performed using the singlicate result from the i-STAT
1 analyzer versus the singlicate result of the comparator method.
The venous and arterial data were pooled, and a Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis
was performed using the i-STAT Ionized Calcium results from the i-STAT CG8+ (white)
cartridges on the i-STAT 1 analyzer versus the comparative method results. Accuracy results
for arterial and venous whole blood specimens for ionized calcium are shown in the table
below.

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP35 to
evaluate the performance of the i-STAT ionized Calcium and Hematocrit tests in the i-STAT
CG8+ (white) cartridge (white) on the i-STAT 1 System using non-anticoagulated venous
and arterial whole blood specimens. The matrix equivalence of each test in the i-STAT CG8+
(white) cartridge was assessed by comparing arterial or venous whole blood specimens
collected without anticoagulant (candidate specimen type) to samples collected with balanced
heparin or lithium heparin anticoagulant (primary specimen type). Each specimen was tested
in duplicate using two (2) i-STAT CG8+ (white) cartridges with two (2) i-STAT 1 analyzers.
A Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis was performed using the first replicate result
from the candidate (y-axis) versus the mean result from the primary specimen (x-axis).
