III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
BD MiniDraw™ Capillary Blood Collection System with BD MiniDraw™ SST™ Capillary
Blood Collection Tube is used to collect, separate, transport, and store capillary blood samples
from individuals 18 years and older. The system is comprised of a capillary blood collection tube
and the BD MiniDraw™ Finger Sleeve that is intended for use by a trained healthcare worker.
BD MiniDraw™ Capillary Blood Collection System with BD MiniDraw™ SST™ Capillary
Blood Collection Tube is intended for sample collection used in the measurement of Alkaline
Phosphatase (ALKP), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Sodium (Na), Chloride (Cl), Albumin
(ALB), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Calcium (Ca), Creatinine (CREAT), Total Bilirubin
(TBIL), Total Protein (TP), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL),
Total Cholesterol (CHOL), and Triglycerides (TRIG).
BD MiniDraw™ SST™ Capillary Blood Collection Tube is not intended for use with other
parameters/analytes.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
If the patient’s fingers do not fit in one of the four BD MiniDraw™ Finger Sleeve sizes, the
MiniDraw™ SST™ System should not be used.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BD MiniDraw™ Capillary Blood Collection System with BD MiniDraw™ SST™ Capillary
Blood Collection Tube consists of the MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube and BD MiniDraw™ Finger
Sleeve. None of the components of the candidate device are provided sterile. The MiniDraw™
SST™ Tube is a plastic blood collection tube intended to collect 435 to 635 μL of whole blood,
indicated by two fill lines on the tube. The BD MiniDraw™ Finger Sleeve attaches the tube to
the patient’s finger during sample collection. The single-use Finger Sleeves come in four sizes.
The following items are provided separately: BD MiniDraw™ Finger Sizing Tool, BD
MiniDraw™ Capillary Tube Adapter SST™, and BD MiniDraw™ Cap Removal Tool.
K230391 - Page 2 of 14

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The BD MiniDraw™ Finger Sizing Tool is used to select the appropriately sized BD
MiniDraw™ Finger Sleeve for the patient. After warming the patient’s hand, the Finger Sleeve is
attached to the MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube and then the finger sleeve is slid onto the patient’s
finger. The BD Microtainer® Contact-Activated Lancet (k223243), sold separately, is used to
lance the finger. After puncture, the MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube is swung into position for blood
collection. Immediately after the blood has been collected, the MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube is
inverted 5 times to mix the blood with the additive. The MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube is placed in a
cap-down orientation at room temperature for 45 minutes to allow for clotting. The MiniDraw
SST™ Capillary Blood Collection Tube contains a silica-based clot activator solution and a gel
that creates a barrier between serum and cells during centrifugation. After clotting is completed
(<120 minutes from blood collection), the MiniDraw™ SST™ Tube should be centrifuged cap-
down orientation. The recommended centrifugation conditions are: 4000 RCF (relative
centrifuge force or g) for 2 minutes and 15 seconds.

b. Operator Variability
A study was performed to evaluate operator to operator variability of the candidate
device for the analytes specified in the IFU. A total of 263 participants were enrolled in
the study. For each participant, two trained health care workers (e.g., pharmacists,
pharmacy technicians, phlebotomists) each collected one sample into a single candidate
device. Results from the same patient were compared to determine variability between
operators. Results from testing samples on Instrument Platform 1 are presented in the
table below.

Information was provided demonstrating that operator-to-operator variability is similar on
Instrument Platform 2.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Extractables and leachables (E&L) and outgassing testing were performed on the candidate
device components to identify chemicals that could potentially contaminate the specimen and
interfere with downstream testing. Study protocols, acceptance criteria and results for this
testing were provided and found to be acceptable.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a. Shelf-Life
Real Time stability testing of the BD MiniDraw™ Capillary Blood Collection System
with the BD MiniDraw™ SST™ Capillary Blood Collection Tube showed that the
candidate device is stable for 9 months when stored at 4 to 25 °C. The stability study
protocol and acceptance criteria has been reviewed and found to be acceptable.
b. Analyte Stability
Analyte stability studies were conducted to assess the analyte within-tube stability for the
analytes specified in the IFU. The study protocols and acceptance criteria have been
reviewed and found to be acceptable. These studies demonstrated within-tube type
stability in the candidate device for up to 4 hours at room temperature and up to 48 hours
at refrigerated conditions. The following storage instructions are included in the device
labeling:
• Remove samples from centrifuge as soon as centrifugation is completed.

• Samples stored and transported at room temperature between 20 and 27 °C (68.0–
80.6 °F) must be tested within 4 hours of collection.
• Samples stored and transported at refrigerated temperature between 2 and 8 °C
(35.6–46.4 °F) must be tested within 48 hours of collection.
• Exposing samples to temperatures below 2 °C (35.6 °F) or above 27 °C (80.6 °F) for
prolonged duration may impact analyte results. Avoid exposure to direct light during
sample storage and transport.
c. Transportation Study
A study was conducted to assess the analyte within-tube stability when exposed to
simulated transportation conditions. Conditions evaluated included:
• Tube Orientation
• Extremes of temperature and humidity
• Vibration / Drop testing
• Altitude
• Light exposure
• Duration of transport
Study protocols and acceptance criteria have been reviewed, and performance was
considered acceptable. The results of the study support that the tubes can be used to
transport serum samples and that the physical tube integrity is maintained when subjected
to the test conditions specified above. However, during prolonged exposure to high
temperature and high humidity (i.e., extreme conditions outside the recommended
transportation), some analytes are clinically impacted. To ensure appropriate handling
during storage and transportation, the following instructions are included in the device
labeling:
• Samples stored and transported at room temperature between 20–27 °C (68.0–80.6
°F) must be tested within 4 hours of collection.
• Samples stored and transported at refrigerated temperature between 2–8 °C (35.6–
46.4 °F) must be tested within 48 hours of collection.
• Exposing samples to temperatures below 2 °C (35.6 °F) or above 27 °C (80.6 °F) for
prolonged duration may impact analyte results. Avoid exposure to direct light during
sample storage and transport.
d. Additional Bench Testing
i. A flex study was performed to evaluate the effect of various centrifugation conditions
on sample quality and analyte stability in the candidate device. These included
variations in the tube orientation (cap up or down), centrifugal force, and
centrifugation time, acceleration, deceleration, and angle. Tube integrity and sample
quality (i.e., barrier formation, hemolysis, red blood cells on barrier) were assessed
and determined to be acceptable for all test conditions. Impact on downstream testing
was assessed by calculating analyte bias between tubes exposed to test conditions and
tubes handled according to the instructions for use. For all analytes tested and all test
conditions, the mean bias between the test condition and the control condition was
within the clinical acceptable limits (CAL). Separated serum volume and serum
K230391 - Page 9 of 14

--- Page 10 ---
separation efficiency (%) was also assessed and determined to be acceptable for all
test conditions. As a result of this testing, the following caution is included in the
labeling:
Tubes that are centrifuged in the cap-up orientation may result in blood clot and gel
below the serum in the tube. Please process according to your facility’s standard
instructions for sampling from capillary tubes (i.e., aliquot into micro sample cups,
etc.)
ii. Additional benchtop studies were performed to demonstrate device durability over
shelf life, including: cap lid closure force, accidental drop seal, reverse centrifuge
seal, transit vibration seal, cap / container pull-off, de-capping, tube to collector pull-
off force, latch press force, tube to collector axial removal force, pivot attachment
force, collector to finger cuff snap de-latch, friction retention, and packaging ship
testing. Study protocols and acceptance criteria have been reviewed, and performance
was considered acceptable.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A study was performed to evaluate equivalence between the BD MiniDraw™ and BD
Microtainer (k991702) and Greiner Bio-One Vacuette® Blood Collection Tubes with Clot
Activator and Gel Separator (K081929) for the analytes claimed in the IFU.
Blood samples were collected at five collection sites representative of the various ancillary
healthcare site settings of the intended use environment. These included a specialized
collection site that collected blood from targeted disease state populations in an outpatient
setting, retail pharmacies, and a patient service center.
Blood was collected from each participant into the capillary (candidate device and BD
Microtainer® SST™) and venous (Greiner Vacuette Serum) study tubes. The operators
(those collecting the capillary samples with the candidate device) were trained pharmacists
and pharmacy technicians. Contrived samples were also prepared in an effort to cover the
assay measurement ranges (AMR) for the analytes claimed in the IFU.
Samples were tested on two different instrument platforms. Results for samples collected in
the candidate device were compared to results for samples collected in the BD Microtainer
and to results for samples collected the Greiner Vacuette. Data was analyzed using Passing
Bablok (PB), Deming (Dem), or Weighted Deming (W Dem) regression. Biases between
