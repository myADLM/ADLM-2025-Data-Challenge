Systems, is a rapid real-time RT-PCR test intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2
RNA in nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal swab specimens collected from individuals with signs
and symptoms of respiratory tract infection.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19 if
used in conjunction with other clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory findings. Positive results
are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Positive results do not rule out bacterial
infection or co-infection with other pathogens.

D Special Instrument Requirements:
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems
(GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48s and GeneXpert Infinity-80s systems).
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative
detection of viral RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and anterior nasal
swab (NS) specimens obtained from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract
infection.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems
(GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48s and GeneXpert Infinity-80 systems), which consist of an
K230440 - Page 2 of 24

--- Page 3 ---
instrument, computer and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results. The
GeneXpert Instrument Systems automate and integrate sample preparation, nucleic acid
extraction and amplification, and detection of the target sequences in simple or complex samples
using real-time reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR assays.
Depending on the instrument, the GeneXpert Instrument Systems can have from 1 and up to 80
randomly accessible modules, each capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-
time RT-PCR and PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the
syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to
move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-
CORE thermocycler for performing real-time RT-PCR and PCR as well as detection. The
systems require the use of single-use disposable cartridges that hold the RT-PCR reagents and
host sample purification, nucleic acid amplification, and detection of the target sequences.
Because the cartridges are self-contained, cross-contamination between cartridges during the
testing process is minimized.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test includes reagents for the detection of viral RNA from SARS-
CoV-2 in NPS and NS specimens. The primers and probes in the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test
are designed to amplify and detect sequences in the genes that encode the following SARS-CoV-
2 proteins: nucleocapsid (N2), envelope (E), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). A
Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the
cartridge utilized by the GeneXpert instrument. The SPC is present to control for adequate
processing of the sample and to monitor for the presence of potential inhibitor(s) in the RT-PCR
reaction. The SPC also ensures that the RT-PCR reaction conditions (temperature and time) are
appropriate for the amplification reaction and that the RT-PCR reagents are functional. The PCC
verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling, and confirms that all reaction components are
present in the cartridge including monitoring for probe integrity and dye stability.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test is designed for use with NPS or NS specimen collected with
nylon flocked swabs and placed into a viral transport medium (VTM), Universal Transport
Medium (UTM) or eNAT.
B Principle of Operation:
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test utilizes automated reverse transcription cDNA synthesis from
RNA and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for gene specific sequence amplification.
Detection of the amplified DNA is by fluorogenic target-specific probe hybridization followed
by 5’-nuclease cleavage of the probe to release the fluorophore (TaqMan).
The technology utilizes lyophilized reagents in the form of freeze-dried beads, which provide all
the components (enzymes, primers, probes, salts, buffers and divalent metal ion) to support PCR
when reconstituted.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Cepheid GeneXpert Instrument Systems [GeneXpert Dx (versions 4.7b or higher), GeneXpert
Infinity-48s and GeneXpert Infinity-80s systems (versions 6.4b or higher)].
2. Specimen Identification:
Anterior nasal (NS) or nasopharyngeal (NPS) swab specimen identification is automated.
K230440 - Page 3 of 24

--- Page 4 ---
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The NPS or NS specimen is collected and placed into a transport tube containing 3 mL of
Viral Transport Medium (VTM)/ Universal Transport Medium (UTM) or 2 mL of eNAT.
The specimen is briefly mixed by rapidly inverting the collection tube 5 times. Using the
supplied transfer pipette, the specimen is transferred to the sample chamber of the Xpert
Xpress CoV-2 plus cartridge. The GeneXpert cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert
instrument, which performs hands-off, automated specimen processing, and real-time RT-
PCR for detection of viral RNA.
4. Calibration:
GeneXpert instruments are calibrated at the factory. Routine calibration of the GeneXpert
Instrument systems may be performed by Cepheid Field Service Engineers during annual
maintenance.
5. Quality Control:
Internal Controls: Each cartridge includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) and Probe
Check Control (PCC).
• Sample Processing Control (SPC) – The SPC is an encapsidated RNA pseudovirus
that ensures adequate lysis of target virus, monitors the presence of PCR inhibitors,
and verifies the use of proper PCR conditions. The SPC passes if it meets the
validated acceptance criteria. The SPC result should be PASS in a sample that is
negative for all three SARS-CoV-2 target analytes and can be NEGATIVE or
POSITIVE in a sample containing detectable levels of one or more of the SARS-
CoV-2 target analytes.
• Probe Check Control (PCC) – Before the start of the PCR reaction, the GeneXpert
System measures the fluorescence signal from the probes to monitor bead
rehydration, reaction tube filling, probe integrity, and dye stability. The PCC passes if
it meets the validated acceptance criteria.
External Controls:
External controls should be used in accordance with local, state, and federal accrediting
organizations as applicable.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Reproducibility and Within-Laboratory Precision Study:
a) Reproducibility Study
The reproducibility of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test was established at three sites (two
external and one internal) using a three-member panel, including one negative sample, one low
positive (~1.5x LoD) sample and one moderate positive (~3x LoD) sample. The negative sample
consisted of simulated NS/NPS matrix without target microorganism or target RNA. The
positive samples were contrived samples in a simulated NS/NPS matrix prepared by spiking the
NATtrol inactivated SARS-CoV- 2 virus strain USA-WA1/2020 (ZeptoMetrix). Testing was
conducted over six days with the GeneXpert Dx and Infinity systems, using three lots of Xpert
Xpress CoV-2 plus cartridges at three participating sites each with two operators to yield a total
of 144 observations per panel member (3 Sites x 2 Operators x 3 Lots x 2 Days/Lot x 2 Runs x 2
Replicates = 144 observations/panel member). The external controls, consisting of one positive
and one negative control, were tested prior to testing panel samples at the site on each day of the
study.
The percent agreement of the qualitative results for SARS-CoV-2 detection for each panel
member analyzed by each of the six operators and each site is shown in Table 1. In addition, the
overall percent agreement for each sample (% total agreement) and the two-sided Wilson Score
confidence intervals (CI) are presented in the last column.

presented in Table 2.
Table 2: Summary of Reproducibility Results – Nested ANOVA by Coefficient of Variation
b) Within-Laboratory Precision Study
The within-laboratory precision of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test was evaluated at a single
site using a three-member panel, including one negative sample, one low positive (~1.5x LoD)
sample and one moderate positive (~3x LoD) sample. The negative sample consisted of
simulated NS/NPS swab matrix without target microorganism or target RNA. The positive
samples were contrived samples in a simulated NS/NPS matrix prepared by spiking the NATtrol
inactivated SARS-CoV- 2 virus strain USA-WA1/2020 (ZeptoMetrix).
Testing was conducted over 20 days, using one lot of Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus cartridges at a
single site and with one operator to yield a total of eighty observations per panel member (1 Site
x 1 Operator x 1 Lot x 20 Days x 2 Runs x 2 Replicates = 80 observations/panel member). The
agreement of the qualitative results for SARS-CoV-2 detection for each panel member, including
the overall percent agreement for each sample (% total agreement) and the two-sided Wilson
Score confidence intervals (CI), are presented in Table 3. The mean, standard deviation (SD),
and coefficient of variation (CV) between-days, between-runs, and within-run for each panel
member are presented in Table 4.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable; this is a qualitative assay.
3. Analytical Reactivity:
a) In silico Inclusivity Analysis
i) The inclusivity of Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus primers was evaluated on June 30th, 2022 using in
silico analysis of the assay amplicons in relation to 11,650,640 SARS-CoV-2 sequences
available in the GISAID gene database for three targets, E, N2 and RdRP. The 11,650,640
SARS-CoV-2 sequences were separated into the lineages of interest based on the Pango Lineage
assigned to each genome by GISAID, and those with ambiguous nucleotides were removed.
Thus, the following inclusivity analyses focuses on the combined, non-ambiguous sequences
from the variants of interest and variants of concern as of June 30th, 2022. These constituted
10,469,612 sequences for the E target, 10,587,381 sequences for the N2 target and 10,333,656
sequences for the RdRP target. Table 5 summarizes the effective predicted inclusivity for E, N2
and RdRP amplicons for the variants of interests and concern.

The in silico inclusivity of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus probe oligonucleotides for E, N2
and RdRP were also assessed against the top 20 most frequent matches in the GISAID
EpiCoV sequence database as of June 15th, 2022, which constituted 10,310, 839 for the E
target, 10,428,014 for the N2 target and 10,178,602 for the RdRP target. For each of the
probe oligonucleotides used in the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test, Table 6 summarizes the
number sequences as well as the corresponding percentage of sequences from this dataset
with exact match, 1 mismatch/insertion, and 2 or more mismatches/insertions in the
alignment.

a. Single-nucleotide mismatches/insertions are predicted to not impact the performance of the test.
ii) Additional evaluation of inclusivity of Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus primers was conducted on
July 31, 2023 using in silico analysis of the assay amplicons in relation to SARS-CoV-2
sequences available in the GISAID gene database for three targets, E, N2 and RdRP. U.S.-
specific sequences were then partitioned into the four time periods of 14, 30, 90 and 180 days
(Tables 7-10) prior to the cutoff date of July 31, 2023 and were stratified by number and
frequency of sequences with exact or mismatched sequences. The in silico inclusivity statistics
for each time period are presented in Tables 7-10. In each of these tables, the results for the two
N2 probes were combined into a single row which represents the best match of either probe.
Table 7: Inclusivity Statistic - Sequences Collected Within 14 Days Prior to July 31, 2023
As shown in Table 7, there are two instances where a specific oligonucleotide was observed to
have a mismatch frequency greater than 1% in the 14-day period. The total number of sequences
collected in the 14-day period is small, which can be a source of bias and may not be
representative of the test performance. Consistent with this account, there were no instances
where a specific primer/probe sequence was observed with greater than 1% frequency of

mismatch in any of the longer time stratifications (30 days, 90 days and 180 days), which would
warrant a risk assessment for adverse impact to the test performance. Based on the built-in
redundancy of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test’s SARS-CoV-2 amplification system (i.e., 3
independent targets, only 1 of 3 must be detected to assign a positive result), it is not anticipated
that any of the evaluated sequences would be missed by the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test.

b) Inclusivity Wet-Testing
In addition to the in silico analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 primers and probes, the inclusivity of the
Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test was evaluated by wet testing against multiple strains of SARS-
CoV-2 at ~3x LoD. A total of 61 strains comprised of 23 intact SARS-CoV-2 viral particles (18
inactivated viral cultures and 5 BSL-3 live viral cultures), and 38 SARS-CoV-2 in vitro RNA
transcripts representing variant strains were tested in this study with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2
plus test. Three replicates were tested for each strain. All SARS-CoV-2 strains tested positive in
all three replicates. Results are shown in Table 11.

4. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a) In Silico Analysis
The analytical specificity/cross-reactivity of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus plan included
evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 test primer and probes with potentially cross-reactive
microorganisms by in silico analysis. The analysis was conducted by mapping the primers
and probes of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus individually to the microorganism sequences
downloaded from the NCBI database. E primers and probes are not specific for SARS-COV-
2 and will detect Human and Bat SARS-coronavirus. No potential unintended cross reactivity
with other organisms listed in Table 12 is expected based on the in silico analysis.

b) Cross-reactivity Wet-Testing
In addition to in silico analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 primers and probes for cross-reactivity,
the analytical specificity of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test was evaluated by bench-testing
a panel of 62 microorganisms comprising (4) human coronaviruses, (1) MERS-coronavirus,
(1) SARS-coronavirus, (20) other respiratory viruses, (30) respiratory bacteria, (2) yeast
strains, (3) fungal strains, and (1) human nasal wash fluid representing a diverse microbial
flora in the human respiratory tract.
The intact viruses were tested at concentrations of ≥105 TCID /mL, ≥105 CEID /mL, and
50 50
≥105 copies/mL. Bacteria and yeast were tested at ≥106 CFU/mL. The bacteria Chlamydia
pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were tested at concentrations of ≥106 IFU/mL and
≥106 CCU/mL, respectively. The live strains of Coxiella burnetii, Lactobacillus reuteri, and
Neisseria meningitides were not available, therefore genomic DNA at ≥ 106 genome
equivalent copies/mL was used. The in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA sample was tested at
≥ 106 genome equivalent/mL for human Coronavirus HKU1, and the genomic RNA sample
was tested at ≥ 106 genome equivalent/mL for SARS-coronavirus Urbani.

The microorganisms being evaluated for cross-reactivity were tested in groups or
individually and spiked into negative simulated NPS/NS background matrix for testing. If a
sample with grouped microorganisms produced a SARS-CoV-2 positive result, then each
member of the group was tested separately. If the individual non-target organism yielded a
positive result, retesting was performed at lower concentrations until a concentration that no
longer produces a false positive result was identified.
The results of the cross-reactivity study demonstrated that the primer/probe sets included in
the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus do not cross-react with the nucleic acids from non-intended
respiratory microorganisms and phylogenetically related human coronavirus species. The one
exception was the SARS-coronavirus Urbani which yielded SARS-CoV-2 POSITIVE test
result. The cross-reactivity for the E gene target was expected with the SARS-coronavirus
Urbani strain which has the highly conserved E gene target shared among coronaviruses in
the B lineage Betacoronavirus. Results are shown in Table 13.

c. Two of 8 replicates reported as ERROR. The runs were successfully repeated to obtain 8 valid replicates.
d. One of 8 replicates reported as ERROR. The run was successfully repeated to obtain 8 valid replicates.
d) Endogenous/Exogenous Interference Substances
An interfering substances study was performed to evaluate if substances naturally present or
artificially introduced into the nasal cavity or nasopharynx interfere with the Xpert Xpress
CoV-2 plus test performance. Positive and negative samples were prepared in simulated
NPS/NS matrix. Each interfering substance was tested at the concentration listed below
(Table 15) in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 and when SARS-CoV-2 is present at 3x LoD. All
specimens were tested in eight replicates on the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test according to
the test procedure. For substances that resulted in an INVALID test result, the concentration
of the substance was reduced by half and re-tested.
Expected results were obtained for all interfering substances tested, except for Mucin (Type
I-S) (2.5 mg/mL) and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray (5 µg/mL). Table 15 below
presents the concentration at which no interference was seen for each substance tested.

WA1/2020 (ZeptoMetrix Inc., USA) spiked at 2.75x LoD (1108 copies/mL) into the pooled
negative clinical NPS in UTM/VTM and into the pooled clinical NPS in eNAT. The same
negative clinical matrix pool was used to provide the negative sample. Aliquots of each
positive and negative sample were stored at 15°C and 30°C to cover the extremes of the
recommended room temperature storage temperature range, and at 2°C and 8°C to cover the
extremes of the recommended refrigerated storage temperature range. All four storage
temperatures were monitored continuously by automated temperature monitoring and access
control system. Eight (8) replicates of the positive sample and 4 replicates of the negative
sample were tested at T=0, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 50 hours after storage at
15°C and 30°C. Eight (8) replicates of the positive sample and 4 replicates of the negative
sample were tested at T=0, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, 6 days, 7 days, and 8 days after storage at
2°C and 8°C.
External positive and negative controls, run daily during the study, reported the expected
Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test results. Aliquots of the negative and positive specimens stored
at 15°C, 30°C, 2°C and 8°C, and tested at their respective timepoints gave expected results.
The study data supports the following specimen stability claims:
• NPS and NS specimens can be stored in UTM/VTM or in eNAT matrix at
refrigerated (2°C - 8°C) temperatures for 7 days and at room temperature (15°C -
30°C) for up to 48 hours until testing is performed on the GeneXpert Instrument
Systems.
Freeze/Thaw Testing for Samples Frozen at -20°C or -80°C in VTM or eNAT
A study was performed to determine equivalency of frozen SARS-CoV-2 samples compared
to fresh samples when tested with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test. Positive samples used
for the fresh and frozen specimen equivalency study were prepared by spiking the NATtrol
SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) strain into pooled negative clinical NPS-UTM/VTM and
NPS-eNAT at concentrations of < 1x LoD, 1-3x LoD and 5x LoD. A negative sample
consisting of negative clinical NPS-UTM/VTM and NPS-eNAT matrices were also included
in the study. The positive and negative samples were tested fresh, and each sample was
subsequently allowed to undergo two freeze-thaw cycles consisting of freezing at -80℃ for
at least 24 hours and thawing at room temperature prior to testing. Thawed samples were
kept on ice prior to testing.
The study data supports the following specimen stability claims:
Frozen clinical NPS-UTM/VTM, clinical NS-UTM/VTM and clinical NPS-eNAT specimens
positive for SARS-CoV- 2 can undergo one cycle of freeze-thaw before testing with the
Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test.
7. Analytical Sensitivity/Limit of Detection (LoD):
The LoD of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test was established using NATtrol inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 virus strain USA-WA1/2020 (ZeptoMetrix Inc., USA) diluted into pooled
negative clinical NPS matrix and negative clinical NS matrix. Clinical NPS specimens were
collected in VTM/UTM and in eNAT, while clinical NS specimens were collected in
VTM/UTM only. The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration for SARS-CoV-2 strain at
which 95% (19/20) of replicates yield a positive result.
K230440 - Page 20 of 24

--- Page 21 ---
The virus strain was initially estimated in a range finding study at >10 concentrations in
replicates of 20 per concentration of virus. Range finding was performed with two cartridge
lots. Probit analysis was performed on the range finding results to estimate the LoDs, and the
estimated LoDs were subsequently confirmed using two lots of Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus
cartridges. For the confirmatory study, testing was also performed in replicates of 20 per
cartridge lot. The highest (least sensitive) LoD value for the two lots evaluated in the
confirmatory study was reported as the final LoD for the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test. The
claimed LoD for SARS-CoV-2 is 403 copies/ mL in Clinical NPS-UTM/VTM (Table 16).
An equivalent LoD (403 copies/ mL) was also established for SARS-CoV-2 in Clinical NPS-
eNAT. The claimed LoD is 462 copies/mL in Clinical NS-UTM/VTM (Table 17).

The analytical sensitivity of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test was also estimated by testing
WHO First International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in pooled negative clinical NS-
UTM/VTM matrix. The study was performed in a random and blinded fashion. The LoD for the
First WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 RNA tested in NS-UTM/VTM matrix with
the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test was 1000 IU/mL (Table 18).

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test detects defined cycle threshold (Ct) ranges for the SARS-
CoV-2 targets and SPC. The Ct cut-offs are hard coded values and are included as automatic
calculations in the assay definition file (ADF) of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test.
9. Carry-Over Contamination Study:
A study was conducted to assess whether the single-use, self-contained Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus
cartridge prevents specimen and amplicon carryover by testing a negative sample immediately
after testing of a very high positive sample in the same GeneXpert module. The study utilized
two GeneXpert instrument modules; both modules were cleaned prior to starting the study. The
negative sample used in this study consisted of simulated NPS/NS matrix and the positive
sample consisted of high SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration (inactivated SARS-CoV-2 USA-
WA1/2020 at 5x104 copies/mL) spiked into negative NPS/NS matrix. The negative sample was
tested in a GeneXpert module at the start of the study. Following the initial testing of the
negative sample, the high positive sample was processed in the same GeneXpert module
immediately followed by another negative sample. This was repeated 20 times in the same
module, resulting in 20 positives and 21 negatives for the module. The study was repeated using
a second GeneXpert module for a total of 40 positive and 42 negative samples. All 40 positive
samples were correctly reported as SARS-CoV-2 POSITIVE and all 42 negative samples were
correctly reported as SARS-CoV-2 NEGATIVE with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test. No
specimen or amplicon carry-over contamination was observed in this study.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not applicable. Please refer to the Clinical Studies Section of this document.
2. Matrix Comparison:
The following studies were performed to establish equivalent performance of Xpert Xpress CoV-
2 plus between (a) clinical nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), clinical anterior nasal swab (NS) and
simulated NPS/NS matrices in Universal Transport Medium (UTM)/Viral Transport Medium
(VTM), and (b) clinical NPS in UTM/VTM and eNAT.
Aliquots of clinical NPS-UTM/VTM, clinical NS-UTM/VTM, and simulated NPS/NS matrices
were screened with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test and negative clinical samples were pooled.
NATtrol inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus strain USA-WA1/2020 (ZeptoMetrix Inc., USA) was
spiked into the negative matrices at 0.05x, 1.5x, 5x, and 10x LoD. Aliquots of the negative and
SARS-CoV-2 positive matrices were tested in replicates 10 (except for 30 replicates in case of
1.5x LoD). Expected results were obtained for all replicates tested.
A similar study as described above, except the simulated NPS/NS matrix, was used to establish
equivalent performance between clinical NPS-UTM/VTM and clinical NPS-eNAT. Expected
results were obtained for all replicates tested.
Clinical Studies:
The clinical performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test was evaluated in a multi-site,
observational and method comparison study in 2022 that included 32 geographically diverse sites
in the United States (US). Of the 32 sites, 5 sites participated in specimen collection only, 26 sites
performed Xpert testing and specimen collection, and 1 site performed Xpert testing as well as
comparator and discrepant testing.

To be enrolled in the study, patients had to be presenting at the study centers showing signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection. One nasal (NS) or nasopharyngeal (NPS) swab collected in a
randomized and blinded fashion from each patient was tested using the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus
test side by side with an FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel that includes SARS-CoV-2. The
demographics of study participants are presented below (Table 19). Of the 4047 specimens
collected from individuals showing signs and symptoms of respiratory infection, a total of 3075
specimens (869 NPS and 1871 NS) passed all study criteria and were used for performance
calculations. The Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement of Xpert
Xpress CoV-2 plus test with the FDA cleared molecular comparator test are presented in Table 20
below. Based on the specimens that yielded non-determinate results (INVALID, ERROR, and NO
RESULT) with Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus, the non-determinate rate was 1.6% (32/2029) with NPS
and 1.4% (28/2018) with NS specimens.
