A Intended Use(s):
The Aptima Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) assay is an in vitro qualitative nucleic acid
amplification test (NAAT) for the detection of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from Chlamydia
trachomatis to aid in the diagnosis of chlamydial urogenital disease using the Panther system.
The assay may be used to test the following specimens from symptomatic or asymptomatic
individuals: patient-collected vaginal swab specimens1 (in a clinical setting); and female and
male urine specimens.
1Patient-collected vaginal swab specimens are an option for screening women when a pelvic
exam is not otherwise indicated. The Aptima Multitest Swab Specimen Collection Kit has not
been evaluated for home use.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as the Intended Use above
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Aptima CT assay is a nucleic acid amplification test that utilizes the target capture (TC),
transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) and hybridization protection assay (HPA)
technologies for the qualitative detection of Chlamydia trachomatis. Specimens are collected and
transferred using their respective collection kit. The transport solution in the kit tube releases the
rRNA target that are then captured by magnetic microparticles. A unique set of primers is used to
amplify the target and the amplicon is detected by nucleic acid hybridization. Assay test results
are automatically interpreted by the Panther System Aptima CT assay software.
This assay is similar to the Aptima Assay for Chlamydia trachomatis (K063451) in that the target
organism is C. trachomatis. The primary differences between the two assays are the platform on
which the assay is performed. There are no modifications to assay reagents.
B Principle of Operation:
The Aptima CT assay combines the technologies of target capture, TMA, and HPA. Specimens
are collected and transferred into their respective specimen transport tubes. The transport
solution in these tubes releases the rRNA target and protects it from degradation during storage.
The target rRNA molecule is isolated from the specimens by use of a capture oligomer via target
capture that utilizes magnetic microparticles. The capture oligomer contains a sequence
complementary to a specific region of the target molecule, as well as a string of deoxyadenosine
residues. During the hybridization step, the sequence specific region of the capture oligomer
binds to a specific region of the target molecule. The capture oligomer:target complex is then
K230451 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
captured out of solution by decreasing the temperature of the reaction to room temperature. This
temperature reduction allows hybridization to occur between the deoxyadenosine region on the
capture oligomer and the polydeoxythymidine molecules that are covalently attached to the
magnetic particles. The microparticles, including the captured target molecule bound to them, are
pulled to the side of the reaction vessel using magnets and the supernatant is aspirated. The
particles are washed to remove residual specimen matrix that may contain amplification reaction
inhibitors. After the target capture steps are completed, the specimens are ready for
amplification. Target amplification assays are based on the ability of complementary
oligonucleotide primers to specifically anneal and allow enzymatic amplification of the target
nucleic acid strands. The Hologic TMA reaction replicates a specific region of the 16S rRNA
from CT via DNA intermediates. A unique set of primers is used for the target molecule.
Detection of the rRNA amplification product sequences (amplicon) is achieved using nucleic
acid hybridization. A single-stranded chemiluminescent DNA probe, which is complementary to
a region of the target amplicon, is labeled with an acridinium ester molecule. The labeled DNA
probe combines with amplicon to form stable RNA:DNA hybrids. The Selection Reagent
differentiates hybridized from unhybridized probe, eliminating the generation of signal from
unhybridized probe. During the detection step, light emitted from the labeled RNA:DNA hybrids
is measured as photon signals in a luminometer, and are reported as Relative Light Units (RLU).

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility
The reproducibility study was conducted over six days, at two external and one internal sites
using the Panther System. Aptima CT assay reproducibility was evaluated across two assay
lots with six operators. Two operators at each of the three testing sites performed a total of
six Aptima CT assay runs per kit lot for a total of 36 runs per kit lot. Each run consisted of a
4-member precision panel: one CT-negative and three CT-positive panel members. A range
of low and high positive panel members were created by spiking swab transport medium with
CT organisms at concentrations from 0.25 IFU/mL to 25 IFU/mL. Reproducibility was
determined by calculating the agreement (with a 95% two-sided confidence interval) with
expected results for each panel member by site, by lot, and overall. Signal variability was
calculated 1) within runs, 2) between runs, 3) between operators, 4) between
sites/instruments, and 5) between reagent lots. Agreement values were 100% for all panel
members. Two invalid results, one at each of the external sites, were excluded from the
analyses.

1 One invalid result was excluded from the analysis.
Within-Laboratory Precision
Within lab repeatability was evaluated using a 6-member precision panel. The negative panel
member consisted of swab transport medium (STM) only and the positive panel members
were created by spiking STM with concentrations of CT organisms ranging from 0.25 to
2,500 IFU/mL. Testing was performed by three operators using three separate Panther
instruments. Two reagent lots were used on each instrument, at two runs per day, with three
replicates, over 12 days. The percent agreement with the remaining panels to the expected
results was 100%, with the lower-bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval 97.4% for
each panel member.

on three Panther systems using two lots of reagents in replicates of 60 per panel member. The
analytical sensitivity claim for the Aptima CT assay is 2.5 IFU/mL. The limit of detection
(LoD) for the Aptima CT assay was further confirmed by testing two quantified strains
(serovars G and E) of CT spiked into negative pools of vaginal matrix Each serovar was
detected with greater than 95% positivity at less than 2.5 IFU/mL (95% detection at 0.00267
IFU/mL for serovar E and 0.00441 IFU/mL for serovar G). The analytical sensitivity of the
Aptima CT assay was evaluated for 15 serovars on the DTS system, including serovars E and
G, the two serovars giving a similar result on the Panther System.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Assay test results are automatically interpreted by the Aptima assay software. A test results
may be negative, equivocal, positive, or invalid as determined by the toral RLU in the
detection step as shown in Table 4.
Table 4. Test Interpretation
Test Interpretation Total RLU (x1000)
Negative 0* < 50
Equivocal 50 to < 100
Low RLU Positive1 100 to < 5,000
Positive 5,000 to < 12,000
Invalid 0* or > 12,000
*A zero (0 x 1000) RLU result on the run report represents a value between zero and 999
RLU. RLU values less than 690 on the Panther System will be reported as invalid.
1 In the low positive range, data suggest positive results should be interpreted carefully, with
the understanding that the likelihood of a false positive may be higher than a true positive.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable.
9. Carry-Over:
Hologic performed a carryover study using high-target sample dilutions of C. trachomatis
rRNA in STM for a final concentration of 5x105 fg rRNA/reaction (rRNA equivalent of
2.5x105 IFU/mL). Each run consisted of at least 20% high positive CT samples interspersed
with negative samples. Carryover was assessed over five runs on each of six Panther
instruments, with a total of 5878 negative samples and 1560 CT high target samples. Eleven
false positive results were produced, giving an overall carryover rate of 0.19% with a 95%
confidence interval of 0.10% to 0.33%.

C Clinical Studies:
Aptima CT assay performance was evaluated in a prospective clinical study, using patient-
collected first catch male and female urine specimens, and patient-collected vaginal swab
specimens. Specimens were collected from 4413 male and female subjects in a multicenter
study. Participants were sexually active individuals at least 14 years of age, attending one of 11
participating geographically diverse clinical collection sites, with or without symptoms of an STI
infection.
Up to five specimens were collected from each female subject (four patient-collected vaginal
swabs, one first-catch urine), and one first catch urine specimen was collected from each male
subject. All specimens were collected by the subject at the clinical sites.
Three clinical testing sites performed Aptima CT assay testing. All comparator testing was
completed at a single central laboratory. The clinical performance of the Aptima CT assay with
vaginal swabs and male urine was evaluated using a Patient Infected Status (PIS) algorithm, and
female urine was evaluated against Composite Comparator Algorithm (CCA), testing each
sample with up to three FDA-cleared NAATs for detection of CT. Specimens were categorized
as “infected” (PIS) for vaginal swabs and male urine and as “positive” (CCA) for female urine.
CT PIS for PVS samples was determined based on the combined PVS and urine result with two
different FDA-cleared NAATs. One or more positive result obtained with each assay designates
the PIS as “infected”. CT PIS for male urine and CT CCA for female urine were determined by
testing each sample with up to three FDA-cleared NAATs. Specimens were categorized as PIS
“infected” for male urine and as CCA “positive” for female urine if a positive result occurred in
at least two of the comparator NAAT results, and as “not infected”/ “negative” if at least two of
the comparator results were negative; the third (tie-breaker) NAAT was only required if the first
two NAAT results were discordant.
Overall, 4247 subjects were included in the clinical performance evaluation. Ages ranged from
14-84 years of age, with the average age range of 34.5 years. Female subjects comprised 53.2%
of the subject population, 98.7% of whom were not pregnant. Of the 4247 subjects, 2283 were
women and 1964 were men. Symptoms were reported in 1939 subjects (45.7%). Samples that
originally met the inclusion criteria were excluded if deemed unsuitable or non-evaluable for
testing based on the respective sample collection package insert.
Ninety-seven (97) female urine specimens were excluded from analysis, including 55 from a
single site. Of these 97 excluded specimens, 54 were excluded because the PIS could not be
determined, and the remaining were due to a sample handling deviation. Of the specimens
collected, 6592 were processed in valid Aptima CT assay runs. Of these, 213 samples generated
invalid results upon initial testing (invalid rate of 3.2%, 95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%); after retesting, 31
(0.5%) samples remained invalid.
A total of 6415 specimens from the 4247 evaluable subjects were included in the analyses
comparing Aptima CT assay results to the PIS or CCA interpretation: 2265 patient-collected
vaginal swabs, 2186 female urine specimens, and 1964 male urine specimens.
Performance characteristics of the Aptima CT assay are shown below in Tables 5 and 6.

The sensitivity of the Aptima CT assay on the Panther system in female urine specimens was
also assessed against vaginal swabs tested on three NAATs. The data showed that the Aptima CT
assay performance female urine specimens is 9.0% lower when compared to vaginal swab tested
on three NAATs.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
For evaluable specimens, the observed positivity rates from testing with Aptima CT assay were
7.3% (160/2186) for female urine specimens, 8.2% (186/2265) for patient-collected vaginal swab
specimens, and 7.4% (146/1964) for male urine specimens.
