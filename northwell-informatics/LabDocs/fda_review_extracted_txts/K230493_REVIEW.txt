a. Lot-to-Lot Precision Study
This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of BD MiniDraw Capillary Blood
Collection System with BD MiniDraw H&H Capillary Blood Collection Tube (BD
MiniDraw H&H System) compared to BD Microtainer Microtube for Automated Processes
(BD MAP EDTA) and Greiner Vacuette Blood Collection Tube with K2EDTA (Greiner
Vacuette EDTA) for repeatability (total), lot-to-lot and tube-to-tube variation for hematology
parameters: Hemoglobin (HgB) and Hematocrit (HCT). This study was conducted at a single
site. Blood from 57 subjects was collected into the study tubes, which consisted of three lots
of each tube type. Samples were tested for the HgB and HCT within 4 hours of collection at
room temperature on the Sysmex XN-1000 (Sampling Module XN-10). Performance of the
BD MiniDraw H&H System for between-lot variation and between-tube variation showed
non-inferiority for all tube comparisons for Hemoglobin (HgB) and Hematocrit (HCT) tested
the Sysmex XN-1000 when compared with the comparator device.

b. Operator-to-Operator Precision Study
This study was conducted to evaluate operator variability of the BD MiniDraw H&H System
compared to BD MAP EDTA and Greiner Vacuette EDTA for Hemoglobin (HgB) and
Hematocrit (HCT). A total of 198 participants were enrolled in the study. Blood was
collected from the same participant into the capillary (BD MiniDraw H&H and BD MAP
EDTA) and venous (Greiner Vacuette EDTA) study tubes, on the same occasion, in
randomized collection order. For each participant, two trained health care workers (e.g.,
pharmacists, pharmacy technicians) collected one BD MiniDraw H&H System each, and two
phlebotomists each collected one venous tube (Greiner Vacuette EDTA) by venipuncture and
one capillary tube (BD MAP EDTA). Testing for HgB and HCT was performed on the
Sysmex XN-1000. Performance of the BD MiniDraw H&H System for between-operator
variation showed non-inferiority for all tube comparisons for Hemoglobin (HgB) and
Hematocrit (HCT) tested the Sysmex XN-1000 when compared with the comparator device.

Shelf-life stability studies were conducted by using BD MiniDraw H&H Tubes at 9 (+1)
months from date of manufacture, compared with MiniDraw H&H Tubes that were recently
manufactured. The studies were conducted by testing Hemoglobin and Hematocrit
parameters. Forty-three apparently healthy subjects 18 years of age or older were enrolled in
this study. The results showed that the shelf-life for the BD MiniDraw H&H Tubes is 9
months when stored at 4–25 °C.
b. Shelf-Life Stability (Additive)
Additive Shelf-life stability studies were conducted by using BD MiniDraw H&H Tubes at
12 (+1) and 14 (+1) months from date of manufacture, compared with MiniDraw H&H
Tubes that were recently manufactured. The studies were conducted by testing K2EDTA in
BD MiniDraw H&H Tubes. Thirty BD MiniDraw H&H Tubes containing K2EDTA
anticoagulant for each lot were tested in this study. The results showed that EDTA amount is
within acceptable limits to achieve functional blood to additive ratio for BD MiniDraw H&H
Tubes at 14 months.
c. Within-Tube Stability
Within-Tube Stability was evaluated by using BD MiniDraw H&H System for Hemoglobin
and Hematocrit. Storage conditions included: 4 hours at room temperature (23–27°C), 36 and
48 hours stored refrigerated (2–8°C). Seventy-eight apparently healthy subjects 18 years of
age or older, were enrolled in this study. Testing for the Hemoglobin and Hematocrit
parameters was performed on the Sysmex XN-1000 (Sampling Module XN-10). The within-
tube stability showed that the samples are stable at 4 hours when stored at room temperature
(23–27°C), and 48 hours when stored refrigerated at 2–8°C.
d. Sample Transport Stability
Sample Transport Stability was evaluated by using BD MiniDraw H&H System to
characterize the effects that extreme storage and transport conditions have on sample quality
and the physical integrity of the H&H Tube. Transport conditions included: 48 hours at
Refrigerated Temperature Storage (2–8°C); 4 hours at Room Temperature Storage (20–
24°C); 4 and 48 hours at High Temperature, High Humidity Storage (38–42°C) / 90%RH.
Testing for the Hemoglobin and Hematocrit parameters was performed on the Sysmex XN-
1000 (Sampling Module XN-10). The transport stability study demonstrated that there is no
impact to physical tube integrity or sample stability when stored and transported in
accordance with product labeling (48 hours at Refrigerated Temperature Storage (2–8°C); 4
hours at Room Temperature Storage (20–24°C); 4 hours at High Temperature, High
Humidity Storage (38–42°C) / 90%RH).

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison study was conducted at two clinical testing sites including 126
subjects 18 years of age or older collected from five representative collection sites.
Participants were enrolled at various collection sites representative of the ancillary health
care site of the intended use environment to enroll patient populations. Blood was collected
from each participant into the capillary (BD MiniDraw H&H System and BD MAP EDTA)
study tubes. Samples were tested for the Hemoglobin (HgB) and Hematocrit (HCT) analytes
on Sysmex XN-1000 (Sampling Module XN-10). Deming or Passing Bablok Regression was
used to estimate average differences between the evaluation tube (BD MiniDraw H&H
System) and the comparator tube (BD MAP EDTA) at medically relevant points for each
analyte.
The results are summarized in the following table:
Regression Parameter Estimates – BD MiniDraw™ H&H System vs BD MAP EDTA
Correlation
Parameter N Intercept (95% CI) Slope (95% CI)
Coefficient
HCT 117 0.2 (-0.73, 0.91) 1 (0.98, 1.03) 0.979
HGB 117 0.1 (-0.07, 0.23) 1 (0.99, 1.01) 0.982
The result demonstrated that the BD MiniDraw H&H System demonstrated the substantial
equivalent performance for the tested parameters (HGB and HCT) compared to the BD MAP
EDTA.
2. Matrix Comparison:
A capillary vs. venous matrix comparison study consisting of 117 normal and pathological
paired capillary K2EDTA whole blood and venous K2EDTA whole blood specimens were
used. Paired specimens collected from the same individuals were assayed in duplicate on the
Sysmex XN-1000 to compare performance between capillary whole blood samples and
venous whole blood samples, and the results were analyzed for Hemoglobin (HgB) and
Hematocrit (HCT). The test result for each parameter was compared between venous and
capillary blood to determine if there were any differences. The investigation found no
statistical or clinical differences using venous or capillary blood for the analytes Hemoglobin
(HgB) and Hematocrit (HCT). The result demonstrates the comparable performance
characteristics for K2EDTA capillary and K2EDTA venous whole blood samples and the
venous whole blood is acceptable for use in tube-specific clinical assessments (i.e., shelf-life
and lot-to-lot precision studies).
