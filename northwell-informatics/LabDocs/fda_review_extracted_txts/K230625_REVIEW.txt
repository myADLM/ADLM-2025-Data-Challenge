II Review Summary:
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the submitter's own
CLASS II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable.
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER'S previously cleared device: CareSens N
Premier BT Blood Glucose Monitoring System, k170614
2. Submitter's statement that the INDICATIONS FOR USE/INTENDED USE of the
modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed
labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available,
advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do
not affect the intended use).
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams,
engineering drawings, photographs, user's and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to
demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified
device has not changed. This change was for:

- The addition of a target glucose range function with associated colored meter display
backlights.
- The device system name was changed from CareSens N Premier BT Blood Glucose
Monitoring System to ReliOn Premier BLU Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
4. Comparison Information (i.e., similarities and differences) to the submitter's legally marketed
predicate device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics.
5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification
on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation
activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter's description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information
between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific
technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as
specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined
substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
The ReliOn Premier BLU Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for single patient use
only. Disinfection efficacy studies were previously performed on the exterior meter materials
(K170614) by an outside testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B
virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg. No.: 67619-12).
A robustness study was also previously performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was
no change in performance or in external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and
disinfection cycles to support 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
