VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated precision of the Access hsTnI assay on the Access 2 Immunoassay
system in several studies following the recommendations in CLSI EP5-A3.
Four lithium heparin plasma samples with troponin concentrations spanning the assay range
were each tested on a single Access 2 in duplicate, in two runs per day, over 20 days for a
total of 40 runs and a minimum of 80 replicates per platform using a single reagent pack lot
at a single site. All four samples used were unique pools of native patient samples. The two
highest concentration samples (1,200 and 15,000 pg/mL targets) were spiked with a natively
sourced troponin.
The within-laboratory (total) imprecision includes within-run (repeatability), between-run,
and between-day variance components. Variance components analysis was used to estimate
within-run, between run, and between-day, %CV and SD. Results for this study are shown
below:

15,000 12,844.5 411.617 3.2 270.2 2.1 202.6 1.6 532.45 4.15
The results of the study support that the enhanced washing protocol did not impact the
precision of the test system.
2. Linearity:
The sponsor evaluated the linearity of the Access hsTnI assay on the Access 2 Instrument
following the recommendations in CLSI EP06-A2 using both serum and lithium heparin
plasma sample types covering the full range of the assay. The results of the study
demonstrate that the mitigation (the enhanced washing procedure) did not impact the
linearity of the test system.
Hook Effect:
Same as described in K172787.

Dilution Recovery:
The sponsor has changed the validated dilution scheme and provided data to support a
dilution ratio of 1:5.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The Analytical Specificity/Interference performance was evaluated in K172787 and the
claims are unchanged.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
2.0 - 27,027 pg/mL.
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate intra-assay carryover and included a limitation in
the labeling describing the carryover observed. In the study, when a sample with cTnI >
150,000 pg/mL (ng/L) was tested on an Access 2 system, intra-assay carryover was observed
if an Access hsTnI was tested after a high cTnI sample. The extent of carryover observed was
directly proportional to the cTnI concentration that was present in the high sample. In the
studies, the estimated carryover was 3-5 pg/mL (ng/L) from a high sample at 270,000 pg/mL
(ng/L) and 5-8 pg/mL (ng/L) from a high sample at 500,000 pg/mL (ng/L).
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability and stability is the same as described in K172787, except the stability of frozen
samples has been updated to support the storage of frozen samples at -20°C for up to 180
days.
6. Detection Limit:
Studies were performed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection
(LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the Access hsTnI assay on the Access 2
instrument using the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2. Blank samples were used in the
LoB studies, lithium heparin samples and serum samples were used in the LoD and LoQ
studies. The results provided for LoB, LoD, and LoQ demonstrate that the modification to
the assay workflow did not impact the claimed measuring range of 2.0-27,027 pg/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The Assay Cut-off was evaluated in K172787.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Two method comparison studies were completed to assess the impact of the modification
using a protocol based on CLSI EP09c. The first study evaluated 40 Lithium Heparin Plasma
and 49 Serum samples across three (3) Access 2 instruments. The second method comparison
K230648 - Page 5 of 7

--- Page 6 ---
study was performed to evaluate 51 Lithium Heparin Plasma and 53 Serum samples across
two (2) Access 2 instruments. Each sample was measured using the proposed test system and
the predicate test system. Each sample was measured in duplicate. The first replicate result
from each sample was utilized to fit a Passing-Bablok linear regression model.
Representative results are shown below:
Instrument Sample Sample Claimed Range Regression Equation Correlation
Type # Range of coefficient/R
Samples
Access 2 Plasma 41 2.0- 8.4 to y= 0.98514x + - 0.998
27,027 24112 1.293997
Serum 51 2.2 to y=0.98254 + - 0.997
23977 0.143634
The results of the method comparison study (including analyses around the cutoffs) show
that the performance of the assay is unchanged since its clearance in K172787.
2. Thermal Method Comparison:
Two Thermal Sensitivity studies were completed to assess the impact of the design change
on the Thermal Sensitivity of the hsTnI immunoassay on the Access 2 Immunoassay system
using a protocol based on CLSI EP09c. In the first study, more than 80 samples (Lithium
Heparin Plasma and Serum) were analyzed across 2 Access 2 instruments. Each sample was
measured at each of three different ambient room temperature conditions and calibration
temperature conditions (18°C, 23°C and 28°C). The second study evaluated more than 80
samples (Lithium Heparin Plasma and Serum) across 2 Access 2 instruments. The results
were analyzed using Passing-Bablok linear regression comparing each potential run
temperature/calibration temperature combination.
The results of the thermal method comparison studies support that the performance of the
assay is unchanged since its clearance in K172787.
3. Matrix Comparison:
The sponsor provided data to support the use of lithium heparin samples and serum samples.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The sponsor provided information to support that the modification to the candidate device
did not impact the clinical performance claims described in K172787.
