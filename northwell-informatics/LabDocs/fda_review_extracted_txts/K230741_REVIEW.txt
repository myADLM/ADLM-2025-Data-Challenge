D Special Instrument Requirements:

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Macro & Micro-Test HCG Pregnancy Test Midstream is a qualitative lateral flow immunoassay
for the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The midstream kits consist of one test
device and a package insert. The result is displayed within the “result window” by two distinct
colored lines, one control line and one test line.
B Principle of Operation:
The tests use a double antibody sandwich immunochromatography method to detect hCG in
human urine. Goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody is coated at the quality control line on the
nitrocellulose membrane, and hCG monoclonal antibody is coated at the test line on the
nitrocellulose membrane. hCG monoclonal antibody labeled with red tracers is coated on the
glass cellulose membrane. After application of the urine specimen, the sample flows upward
under the action of chromatography and hCG in the sample binds to the anti-hCG and is captured
by the hCG monoclonal antibody at the test line, thus a red band appears at the test line. If hCG
is not present or the concentration is too low, no red band appears at the test line. Regardless of
the hCG concentration in the samples, a red band will form at the quality control line where goat
anti-mouse polyclonal antibody will bind to hCG monoclonal antibody. The test result is shown
in the result window and is read visually 5 to 10 minutes after urine application. Two distinct
colored lines, one in the test zone and another in the control zone indicate a positive test result
(pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the test zone and only a colored line in the control zone
indicates a negative test result (not pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the control zone, even
in the presence of a colored line in the test zone, indicates an invalid test result.

in replicates of 10 per day, at 3 sites. A total of 150 replicates were tested for at each hCG
concentration. Testing was repeated for 5 non-consecutive days. The device has 100% positive
detection at the claimed sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL and above. There were no significant
differences in performance between lots, between operators, between time of day and between
days. Summary of results are presented in the following tables.

2. Linearity:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity:
The candidate device was tested for potential cross-reactivity from follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Each potential cross-
reactant was spiked into a negative pooled human urine sample (control) and a positive pooled
human urine sample containing 25mIU/mL hCG (test). Test and control samples were tested in
replicates of 5 with 3 lots of the candidate device (Macro & Micro-Test HCG Pregnancy Test
Midstream). The results demonstrated no cross-reactivity from potential cross-reactants up to
500 mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH, and 1000 mIU/mL TSH in either negative or positive
urine samples.
Interference from exogenous and endogenous substances:
Urine samples from non-pregnant women were collected (negative samples) and half were
spiked with hCG to final concentration of 25 mIU/mL (positive samples). All samples were
spiked with final concentrations of potential interferents listed in the below table. For each
condition 15 replicates were tested on 3 device lots by a single operator. The results
demonstrated no interference from substances at the concentrations shown in the table below.

Effect of hCG Beta Core Fragment:
Urine samples from non-pregnant females (negative) were used to prepare samples at 0 mIU/mL
(negative) and 25 mIU/mL (positive) hCG. The positive and negative samples were then spiked
with the hCG β-core fragment concentrations of 500,000 pmol/L and 1,000,000 pmol/L. The
results demonstrated that the candidate device is not affected by concentrations of hCG β-core
fragment up to 1,000,000 pmol/L.

Effect of urine pH:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in urine pH, urine samples containing 0 mIU/mL
and 25 mIU/mL of hCG were adjusted to pH values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0. The results
demonstrated that changes in pH ranging from 4.0 to 9.0 do not interfere with either positive or
negative results from the device.
Effect of urine specific gravity:
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, urine samples containing 0
mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL of hCG were adjusted to specific gravities of 1.00, 1.005, 1.010,
1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030 and 1.035. The results demonstrated that changes in specific gravity
ranging from 1.000 to 1.035 do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the
device.
High dose hook effect study:
Urine samples from non-pregnant women were used to prepare samples with hCG concentrations
of 500 mIU/mL, 1000 mIU/mL, 10,000 mIU/mL, 100,000 mIU/mL, 500,000 mIU/mL and
1,000,000 mIU/mL. Each of the samples was tested using 3 lots of the device. No hook effect
was observed at concentrations up to 1,000,000 mIU/mL hCG.
