IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Alinity ci-series
The Alinity i System (previously cleared in k170317) and the Alinity c System (previously
cleared in k170316) were designed to be combined into multimodule configurations. The Alinity
ci-series is comprised of individual processing modules that may be arranged into individual or
multimodule configurations which include either multiple Alinity i processing modules, multiple
Alinity c processing modules, or a combination of up to four of both Alinity i and Alinity c
processing modules with a shared system control module (SCM). The SCM includes the reagent
and sample manager (RSM). The multimodule configurations do not have a separate device label
or list number. In a multimodule configuration, each processing module retains its original
unique identification label and each multimodule configuration includes a single shared SCM
with a single shared RSM. The Alinity ci-series is comprised of the following components and
functions:
• System Control Module (SCM): contains a user interface computer that provides
software interface to the Alinity ci-series and provides an interface to a host or
middleware computer. The power supply operates the user interface computer and the
Reagent and Sample Manager (RSM).
• Reagent and Sample Manager (RSM): Transport system used to load calibrators,
controls, specimens, reagents, and onboard solutions (e.g., lifts, positions, and moves
racks and cartridges to and from different areas). One primary RSM transports samples
and reagents through an Alinity ci-series.
• Alinity i processing module: uses chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay
(CMIA) detection technology to measure analyte concentration in samples. It is an
immunoassay analyzer that can process up to 200 CMIA tests per hour and has 47
positions in the reagent carousel to hold assay reagent cartridges and calibrators/control
racks at a controlled temperature.
• Alinity c processing module: uses photometric detection technology to measure sample
absorbance for the quantification of analyte concentration and uses potentiometric
K230790 - Page 3 of 17

--- Page 4 ---
detection technology to measure the electrical potential in a sample. An integrated chip
technology (ICT) module is used to measure potentiometric assays (electrolytes). The
ICT module contains Na+, K+, Cl-, and reference electrodes to potentiometrically
measure the concentration of analytes in samples. It is a chemistry analyzer that can
process up to 1350 photometric and potentiometric tests per hour and has 70 positions in
the reagent carousel to hold assay reagent cartridges and calibrators/control racks at a
controlled temperature.
• Multimodule Integration Kit: provides the necessary components to physically connect
the different processing modules, extending them to the RSM and creating a shared load
platform for multimodule configurations. The components in this kit include fasteners,
waste manifold, different length drive belt and cables including communications, power,
ethernet, motor, and ground.
Alinity i Total β-hCG Reagent Kit (Previously cleared in k170317)
The Alinity i Total β-hCG Reagent Kit consists of magnetic microbeads coated with anti-hCG
monoclonal antibody in TRIS buffer with protein (bovine) stabilizers and anti-hCG monoclonal
antibody labeled with acridinium in MES buffer with protein (bovine) stabilizers. The Reagent
Kit is composed of two cartridges, and each cartridge contains two vials (microparticle antibody
and conjugate antibody) and a spacer (empty cartridge).
Alinity c Glucose Reagent Kit (Previously cleared in k170316)
The Alinity c Glucose Reagent Kit consists of ATP•2Na (9.0 mg/mL), NAD (5.0 mg/mL), G-6-
PDH (3000 U/L), hexokinase (15 000 U/L), and preservative: sodium azide (0.05%).
Alinity c ICT Sample Diluent (Previously cleared in k170320)
The Alinity c ICT Sample Diluent consists of 68.2 mL reagent 1 and buffer for 9350 tests (935
tests per cartridge, x10 cartridges per kit). One test per sample can generate one to three results
(Na+, K+, and Cl-).
B Principle of Operation:
The Alinity i System module is a fully automated immunoassay analyzer allowing random and
continuous access, as well as priority and automated retest processing using chemiluminescent
microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology. CMIA technology is used to determine the
presence of antigens, antibodies, and analytes in samples. The Alinity c System is a fully
automated, random access chemistry analyzer using detection technologies such as quantitative
ion selective electrodes (with an integrated chip technology module) or colorimetric, enzymatic
methods to determine analyte concentrations in body fluids.
The Alinity i Total β-hCG Reagent Kit is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative and
qualitative determination of β-hCG in human serum and plasma using chemiluminescent
microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology. A specific mouse anti-hCG monoclonal
antibody is coated on the magnetic beads; another monoclonal antibody is labeled with an
acridinium-labeled conjugate. After addition of sample, calibrator, or controls to the microbead-
antibody conjugate, the mixture is incubated in the reaction vessel (RV) allowing β-hCG present
in samples, calibrator, or controls to bind to the monoclonal antibody on the bead. A magnet
attracts the paramagnetic microparticles (which are bound to β-hCG) to a wall of the RV. The
wash zone assembly washes the reaction mixture to remove unbound materials. After a washing
K230790 - Page 4 of 17

--- Page 5 ---
step, the chemiluminescent, acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to the RV, reacting with hCG
already bound to the magnetic beads to form sandwich complexes. The wash zone assembly
washes the reaction mixture once more to remove unbound materials. Subsequently, the Pre-
Trigger Solution (hydrogen peroxide) is added to prepare the mixture for the chemiluminescent
reaction. Then the Trigger Solution (sodium hydroxide) is added to initiate a chemiluminescent
reaction. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as Relative Light Units, which is
proportional to the concentration of total β-hCG present in samples. For qualitative interpretation
of the Alinity I Total β-hCG test results, specimens with β-hCG levels less than or equal to 5.00
mIU/mL will be reported in the INTERPRETATION field on the test results screen or printout
as “NEGATIVE.” Specimens with β-hCG greater than or equal to 25.00 mIU/mL will be
reported as “POSITIVE.” Specimens with β-hCG levels greater than 5.00 mIU/mL and less than
25.00 mIU/mL will be reported with concentrations only. No interpretation will be reported for
these results.
The concentration of glucose is determined by the glucose hexokinase method. Glucose in the
specimen is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) in the presence of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) and magnesium ions to produce glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and adenosine diphosphate
(ADP). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) oxidizes G-6-P to 6-phosphogluconate
with the concurrent reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH). The NADH produced is detected spectrophotometrically
at 340 nm.
Ion-selective electrodes (ISE) for sodium, potassium, and chloride utilize membranes selective to
each of these ions. An electrical potential (voltage) is developed across the membranes between
the reference and measuring electrodes in accordance with the Nernst equation. The voltage is
compared to previously determined calibrator voltages and converted into ion concentration.

Alinity c ICT Sample Diluent Potassium 5-Day Precision Study on the Alinity ci-series
Precision studies for the Alinity c ICT Sample Diluent Potassium assay were previously
reviewed in k170320 on the single module Alinity c System using human serum and urine.
A precision study was performed to evaluate the precision of the Alinity c ICT Sample
Diluent Potassium assay on the Alinity ci-series using human serum samples. Two panels
were prepared by combining potassium stock solution with serum stripped of potassium to
create two panels with target concentrations of 2 and 9 mmol/L. In addition to these panels,
three levels of controls were tested using one reagent lot and one instrument. The samples
were tested in replicates of four, two times per day on five different days for a total of 40
measurements per sample. The precision results on the Alinity ci-series are summarized
below.
