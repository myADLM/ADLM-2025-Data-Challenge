IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Concentriq Dx is a web-based, software-only device that is intended to aid pathology
professionals in viewing, interpretation and management of digital whole slide images (WSI) of
scanned surgical pathology slides prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue obtained from Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner. It aids the pathologist in
the review, interpretation, and management of pathology slide digital images used to generate a
primary diagnosis.
Concentriq Dx is operated as follows:
1. After the WSI image is acquired using the Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide
scanner accordance to the WSI scanner Instructional Manual and any additional standard
laboratory procedures, the WSI from the local file system is ingested into Concentriq Dx at
which point the Concentriq Dx workflow is initiated.
2. The reading pathologist selects a case from a worklist external to the subject device or
from within the subject device, whereby the subject device fetches the associated images
from the image storage.
3. The image quality and other image data is evaluated and deemed acceptable, prior to
using a whole slide image for diagnosis.
4. The reading pathologist uses the subject device to view and interpret the images using the
following actions:
• Zoom and pan the image
• Measure distances in the image
• Annotate the image
• View multiple images side by side
5. The above steps are repeated as required.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling and handling are performed upstream and independent of the use of the
subject device. Specimen sampling includes biopsy or resection specimens which are
processed using histology techniques. The FFPE tissue section is H&E stained. Digital
images are then obtained from these glass slides using the NanoZoomer S360MD Slide
scanner.
4. Calibration:
Not applicable
5. Quality Control:
Prior to using a whole slide image for diagnosis, the pathologist should ensure that all
scanned slide images have been imported for every case and the images are of acceptable
quality for diagnostic purposes. The pathologist reviews scanned images from all the slides
associated with a case before rendering a diagnosis.

B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Technical performance testing was conducted with Concentriq Dx. The subject device was
compared to the image management software component of the predicate devices image
review manipulation software (IRMS, as defined in FDA guidance document, “Guidance for
Industry – Technical Performance Assessment of Digital Pathology Whole Slide Imaging
Devices,” dated April 20, 2016) using the quantitative pixel-wise comparison method. The
basis for the comparison was the CIEDE2000 color difference equation, ΔE.
a. Bench Testing – Pixel-wise comparison test
The objective of the study was to validate the performance of Concentriq® Dx in processing
and rendering images produced by the Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner
system (NZ) in the native and proprietary NDPI format (Predicate Device). In addition, the
Concentriq® Dx image fidelity and performance between the Concentriq Dx image viewer
software (Test Device) and the Hamamatsu NZViewMD software image viewer were
evaluated.
A total of 30 whole slide images of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue glass
slides from a diverse set of human anatomic sites, including but not limited to Breast, Colon,
Esophagus, Skin and Prostate were used in the analysis. These slides were scanned using the
NanoZoomer 360MD scanner. For each of the 30 tissue slides, 6 ROIs were captured,
including 3 at 20x and 3 at 40x magnification, for a total of 180 ROIs. Each ROI was
captured under 3 viewer environments: the Predicate Device, the Test Device under Google
Chrome, and the Test Device under Microsoft Edge. The image data of all the ROIs were
provided for verification.
Test results were provided by computing the ΔE value between each pair of corresponding
pixels using the CIEDE2000 color difference equation. Test results showed that the 95th
percentile of the pixel-wise color difference in any image pair between the subject and
predicate device was not less than 3 CIEDE2000 (i.e., < 3 ΔE00 was not achieved).
Therefore, a clinical validation study was conducted to supplement the non-clinical
performance test data to support the performance of the device.
b. Clinical Validation Study
A clinical study was conducted to demonstrate that viewing, reviewing and diagnosing WSIs of
H&E stained FFPE tissue slides using the Concentriq Dx [manual digital read (MD)] is non-
inferior to glass slide reads using optical (light) microscopy [manual optical read (MO)]. The
primary endpoint of the study was the difference in major discordance rates between MD and
MO when compared to the original sign-out pathologic diagnosis, defined as the ground truth
(GT) diagnosis.
The study included 275 samples that represented the breadth and range of organs in routine
K230839 - Page 7 of 10

--- Page 8 ---
clinical practice which also including challenging sample types and diagnoses in
histopathology. Study samples included one representative H&E slide per case. Of the 275
samples, the diagnosis for one slide was not available due to a missing data point and was
excluded from all statistical analyses. Therefore, all analyses included 274 individual samples.
The glass slides were scanned using the FDA-cleared Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360 MD Slide
Scanner at 40x magnification at one site and reviewed by 3 study pathologists at their individual
sites using the Concentriq Dx device and a JVC JD-C240BN01A monitor, as specified by the
NanoZoomer instructions for use (IFU) and the Concentriq Dx IFU. Images were reviewed for
image quality according to the NanoZoomer IFU prior to uploading to the Concentriq Dx
platform.
Three pathologists read all deidentified glass slide samples using the MD and MO modalities
with a washout of 2 weeks between each separate modality read. All 3 reading pathologists read
the slides for all cases using both MD and MO. The reading pathologists were provided with 3
batches of slides and the batches were randomized for each modality read. A case report form
(CRF) was completed to document the reading pathologist’s diagnosis for each batch and each
read (MD and MO). Reads from both modalities (MD or MO) were adjudicated by an
independent pathologist who did not participate in any of the MD or MO reads to determine
agreement with the GT and to each other to determine concordance, minor discordance or major
discordance between the study diagnosis (by WSI and glass methods) and the GT. A major
discordance was defined as a difference in diagnosis that would be associated with a clinically
important difference in patient management. A minor discordance was defined as a difference
in diagnosis that would not be associated with a clinically important difference in patient
management.
The primary endpoint was the difference in major discordance rates between MD and MO
diagnoses relative to GT diagnoses. The primary analysis evaluated the null hypothesis that the
difference in major discordances rates between MD and MO is not less than 0.04 (4% of slides)
using a one-sided noninferiority assessment. A secondary analysis was to evaluate the major
discordance rate between the MO and MD diagnoses.
The difference in the major discordance rate between MD and GT compared to MO and GT
were -0.1% (95% CI, -1.0, 0.4) for all cases across the 3 reading pathologists (N: 274*3=822)
as shown in Table 4 below. The upper limit of the confidence interval (CI) for the difference in
the major discordance rate was 0.4%, which is less than the prespecified noninferiority
threshold of 4%; therefore, the clinical study met the primary study endpoint.

The cumulative data of the clinical study support the conclusion that Concentriq Dx is safe and
effective when used by pathologists in rendering a primary diagnosis as compared to a glass
slide assessment when used according to the device intended use.
c. Turnaround Time
Turnaround time was measured and recorded for the time to initially load an image and the
time to load an image when panning and zooming while using Concentriq Dx to view WSI
images acquired on the predicate devices. The results of each test scenario met the success
criteria. The test execution demonstrated acceptable image load time during different
scenarios anticipated during regular use of Concentriq Dx.

d. Measurements – area and distance
Measurement accuracy was demonstrated through a study comparing the measurements of
markings made in the Concentriq viewer to those on a calibration slide with a grid of known
dimensions. Study data showed that the distance and area measurements made in the
Concentriq Dx viewer were consistent with the ground truth. These results demonstrated
acceptable measurements accuracy with respect to its intended use.
e. Human Factors (Usability) Testing
A human factors summative study was conducted to assess the use-related safety and
effectiveness of Concentriq Dx with representative users in a representative use
environment to provide adequate evidence that the user interface design (including the
device and labeling) supports safe and effective use.
The evaluation method was based on applicable content of the human factors process,
