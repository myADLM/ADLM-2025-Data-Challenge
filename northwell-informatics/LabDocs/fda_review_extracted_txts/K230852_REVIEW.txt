VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a. Single Site Precision:
A precision study was performed at one site testing the controls and samples with each
reagent/instrument combination for 20 days, with two runs a day and two replicates per run
(n=80 per material for each reagent lot). Three different reagent lots of HemosIL
Chromogenic Factor IX were tested on three ACL TOP Family models, and one reagent lot
of HemosIL Chromogenic Factor IX tested on three ACL TOP Family 50 Series models.
Each reagent lot was tested with the same control lots (normal and abnormal) and the same
three factor IX plasma sample pools, with approximate target concentrations of 4%, 65%,
and 100% activity. The precision estimates were calculated and the results for repeatability
are provided in the summary table below.

b. Reproducibility:
The reproducibility performance of HemosIL Chromogenic Factor IX was conducted at one
internal and two external sites all located in the US. The testing was performed by one
operator with one representative instrument and one reagent lot per site. At each site there
were two control levels (normal and abnormal), five sample pools covering the claimed
analytical range, with approximate target concentrations of <1%, 3%, 30%, 65%, and 100%
activity and three sample pools spiked with a factor IX concentrate, with approximate target
concentrations of 3%, 30%, and 100% activity. Each material was tested in triplicate, twice a
day for 5 days, for a total of 30 replicates per level. The precision estimates were calculated
and results for reproducibility are provided in the summary table below.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was performed with three different lots of HemosIL Chromogenic Factor
IX tested on a representative ACL TOP Family model (ACL TOP 700), and one lot of
HemosIL Chromogenic Factor IX tested on a representative ACL TOP Family 50 Series
model (ACL TOP 750). For each panel, a high plasma pool was created using a high factor
IX activity plasma pool (~250% activity). If the high plasma pool had to be diluted, a low
pool of immunodepleted FIX deficient plasma (< 1% activity) was used. The panels, which
consisted of at least nine levels, were made by mixing portions of the high factor plasma pool
with the low plasma pool. Four replicates of each level were run from lowest factor
concentration to highest factor concentration. Samples were run on the same day as
preparation.
The linear range for Chromogenic FIX assay was determined to be 1.0%–150% FIX activity.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
An interference study was performed internally to establish limits for the HemosIL
Chromogenic Factor IX using three reagent lots on a representative ACL TOP Family model
(ACL TOP 700) and ACL TOP Family 50 Series model (ACL TOP 750 CTS). The study
included the following interfering substances: hemoglobin, bilirubin, triglycerides,

Sample Stability
Studies were performed to support the recommended storage and handling instructions
detailed in the device labeling. Internal sample stability studies were performed at 2–8°C and
15–25°C, with one reagent lot of HemosIL Chromogenic Factor IX tested on one
representative ACL TOP Family or ACL TOP Family 50 Series. For the study, four sample
plasma pools (~<1%, ~15%, ~65%, ~100% factor IX activity) were prepared. Specimens are
stable up to 8 hours at 15–25°C and up to 8 hours at 2–8°C.
Shelf-life Stability
Three lots of HemosIL Chromogenic Factor IX (whole kits) were stored at 2–8°C for the
duration of the study. At time zero (t ) and periodic time intervals, a factor IX activity plasma
0
sample pool at ~65% activity and two freshly prepared control levels (normal and abnormal)
were tested on a representative ACL TOP Family/ACL TOP Family 50 Series model. At t
0
for each kit lot, the plasma sample pool and control levels were tested in 10 replicates to
establish the baseline means, then in triplicate at each successive time point, and these mean
results compared to the t baseline means. The study supports a shelf-life stability claim of 28
0
months for HemosIL Chromogenic Factor IX at 2–8°C.
Open Vial Stability
The open vial or reconstituted claims were established by testing three lots of HemosIL
Chromogenic Factor IX kit components reconstituted (Reagent A and Reagent B) or opened
(Substrate) and stored at ≤ -65°C for the duration of the study and reconstituted (Reagent A
and Reagent B) or opened (Substrate and Buffer) and then stored at 2–8°C for the duration of
the study. At time zero (t ) and each successive time point, a factor IX activity plasma sample
0
pool at ~65% activity and two freshly prepared control levels (normal and abnormal) were
tested with the stressed individual kit components on a representative ACL TOP Family/ACL
TOP Family 50 Series model. The plasma sample pool and control levels were tested in 10
replicates to establish baseline means, then in triplicate (triplicate or six replicates for 2–8°C),
at each successive time point and these mean results compared to the t baseline means.
0
Between t and the successive time points, the applicable kit component was capped and
0
stored in its original vial at ≤ -65°C and 2–8°C, then removed from storage, thawed,
uncapped, and placed on the instrument for testing.
Reagent A and Reagent B: Stability after reconstitution: 72 hours at 2–8°C in the closed
original vial or 4 months at ≤ -65°C. Frozen reagent may be thawed once and gently mixed
before use. Do not refreeze.
Substrate: Opened reagent is stable 1 month at 2–8°C in the closed original vial or 12 months
at ≤ -65°C. Frozen reagent may be thawed once and gently mixed before use. Do not
refreeze.
Buffer: Opened reagent is stable for 12 months at 2–8°C.

On-Board Stability
The on-board stability claims were established for the individual HemosIL Chromogenic
Factor IX kit components: for Reagent A and B, Substrate and Diluted Buffer. Three lots of
HemosIL Chromogenic Factor IX kit components were reconstituted (Reagent A and
Reagent B) and opened/prepared (Substrate and Diluted Buffer) and then placed on-board the
instrument for the duration of the study. At time zero (t ) and periodic time intervals, a factor
0
IX activity plasma sample pool at ~65% activity and two freshly prepared control levels
(normal and abnormal) were tested with the stressed individual kit components on a
representative ACL TOP Family/ACL TOP Family 50 Series model. At t0 for each kit lot
using one of the reconstituted or opened/prepared components, the plasma sample pool and
control levels were tested in 10 replicates to establish baseline means, then in triplicate at
each successive time point, and these mean results compared to the t baseline means.
0
Between t and successive time points, the applicable kit component remained on-board the
0
instrument uncapped.
Reagent A and Reagent B: 8 hours at 15°C on the ACL TOP Family and ACL TOP Family
50 Series.
Substrate: 24 hours at 15°C on the ACL TOP Family and ACL TOP Family 50 Series.
Diluted Buffer: Stability after dilution: 24 hours on the ACL TOP Family and ACL TOP
Family 50 Series.
6. Detection Limit:
The detection limit was performed to test HemosIL Chromogenic Factor IX on the ACL TOP
Family and ACL TOP 50 Series for Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ). The study was performed using three different lots of HemosIL
Chromogenic Factor IX tested on a representative ACL TOP Family model (ACL TOP 700)
and ACL TOP Family 50 Series model (ACL TOP 750 CTS). Four blank samples were
prepared from FIX immunodepleted plasma for the LoB study, and six low level samples,
each targeting a different % activity level were prepared using Factor IX Deficient Plasma
<1% Activity (Immunodepleted), and WHO 5th International Standard for Blood Coagulation
Factor IX Concentrate for the LoD and LoQ studies. Aliquots maintained at ≤ -65°C for the
duration of the study.
LoB determination: Four different blank samples were run in six replicates each across three
days for a total of n=72 replicates for each of the three reagent lots and two instruments.
LoD determination: Six low level samples, each targeting a different FIX % activity level,
were run in four replicates each across three days for a total of n=24 replicates for each of the
three reagent lots and two instruments.
LoQ determination: Five low level samples, each targeting a different FIX % activity level,
were run in five replicates each across five days for a total of n=25 replicates per respective
lot and instrument, and n=50 overall across all testing days and instrument systems per
reagent lot.

8. Recovery of Factor FIX Replacement Concentrates:
The recovery of replacement therapy concentrates study was performed to compare dilutions
of different factor IX concentrates (AlphaNine SD, BeneFIX, IDELVION and Rebinyn),
tested with HemosIL Chromogenic Factor IX on one ACL TOP Family model. There were
panels tested consisting of at least seven to fourteen levels made by mixing high factor IX
concentrate plasma pool with the low factor IX plasma pool. For each panel, the low factor
plasma pool was factor IX immunodepleted plasma. Four replicates of each level were run.
The FIX percent recovery was determined from the measured versus expected FIX activity
(%) of each product at each level. HemosIL Chromogenic Factor IX recovered FIX activity
levels in plasma containing AlphaNine SD, BeneFIX, IDELVION and Rebinyn at
concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 200% of FIX activity. There was an over-estimation of
Idelvion across all concentrations relative to labeled potency.
Product Mean Percent Recovery (%)
AlphaNine SD 90
BeneFIX 93
Rebinyn 112
Idelvion* 159
* Per the manufacturer’s recommendations, a one stage clotting assay is recommended for measurement
of Idelvion and results may vary based on the APTT reagent in use.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison and Predicted Device:
The Method Comparison study was performed at four clinical, research and/or satellite
laboratories. There was a total of 344 citrated plasma samples assayed by HemosIL
Chromogenic Factor IX (subject device) and HemosIL Factor IX deficient plasma (predicate
device). The study used two reagent lots of HemosIL Chromogenic Factor IX tested on
representative members of the ACL TOP Family and ACL TOP Family 50 series, using
retrospective banked frozen samples from patients with von Willebrand disease, patients with
hemophilia A and B and patients on factor IX replacement therapies. Each sample was
analyzed in singlicate on both the subject and predicate devices at each site. The following
table summarizes the line equation from the Passing-Bablok regression analysis performed
for the combined dataset.
