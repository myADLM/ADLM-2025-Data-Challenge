III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The BD Vacutainer® Serum Separator (SST™) Blood Collection Tube is a sterile, single use
tube used for the collection, containment, transport, and centrifugation of venous blood
specimens to obtain and store serum for in vitro diagnostic testing. It is used in settings where a
venous blood specimen is collected by a trained healthcare professional. The BD Vacutainer®
Serum Separator (SST™) Blood Collection Tube is used for clinical laboratory testing in
chemistry and for the monitoring of certain therapeutic drugs.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Do not use BD Vacutainer® SST™ Tubes for trace element testing.
Do not use if foreign matter is present or if tube is damaged.
Examine tubes prior to use. Clot activator additive is visible in the tube and should appear as
white dots. Do not use the tube if the additive is missing, discolored, or if foreign matter or
precipitate is present.
Separation of serum from the cells should take place within 2 hours of collection to prevent
erroneous test results, unless evidence is available supporting longer times from collection to
serum separation.
Follow your facility’s procedures if clots or other visible obstructions are present in the serum
sample as this could lead to the inability to test the specimen.
Any change in blood collection tube type, size, handling, processing or storage condition for a
particular laboratory assay should be evaluated by the laboratory to verify the current reference
range or to establish a new reference range for each instrument/reagent system per the
laboratory's standard procedure.
BD Vacutainer® SST™ Blood Collection Tubes may contain trace levels of acetone, hexane, and
formate. It has not been determined if the presence of trace levels of these compounds will affect
test results in chromatography-based assays.
Hydrophobic drugs have been known to demonstrate gel adsorption in gel separator tubes, which
may result in lower measured drug concentrations. However, these effects depend on various
factors including the chemical and physical properties of the drug, contact time with the gel,
volume of the sample on the gel, storage temperature, and gel type. Users should consider these
factors when evaluating the use of gel separator tubes for drug testing and monitoring. See Drug
Adsorption in the References section.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BD Vacutainer® Serum Separator (SST™) Blood Collection Tubes are plastic, evacuated,
sterile, single use, in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The tubes are comprised of a plastic tube
(polyethylene terephthalate, PET) containing an inert gel separator and a clot activator, and a
closure (either a BD Vacutainer® Hemogard™ closure assembly or a conventional stopper).
Tube stoppers are lubricated with silicone to facilitate stopper insertion. The interior of the tube
is spray-coated with a silica clot activator that is mixed with a silicone surfactant. In addition to
the clot activator, the tube contains an inert gel separator that provides a mechanical barrier to
separate the serum from the rest of the blood components. The tubes are available in 13x75mm,
13x100mm and 16x100mm configurations with draw volumes ranging from 3.5 to 10 mL. The
amount of gel can vary based on tube size.
B Principle of Operation:
The BD Vacutainer® Serum Separator (SST™) Blood Collection Tubes use controlled vacuum
to draw a specific volume of blood into the sterile interior of the tube. Within the tube, a clot
activator is present to help clot the red blood cells, isolating them from the serum and other blood
components. The presence of a surfactant is intended to reduce adhesion of red blood cells and
fibrin to the tube walls. The inert gel separator provides a mechanical barrier to separate the
serum from the rest of the blood components. The density of the gel separator causes it to move
upward during centrifugation to the serum-clot interface, where it forms a barrier separating
serum from fibrin and red blood cells.
The tubes are compatible with BD Vacutainer® Blood Collection Needles, Blood Collection Sets,
Transfer Devices, Holders and Adapters. Once the vein of the patient has been penetrated using a
standard needle, the collection tube is centered in the holder and pushed onto the needle,
puncturing the stopper of the tube. Immediately after the blood has been drawn, the tube is gently
inverted 5 times to mix the blood with the additive. Blood should be allowed to clot for a
minimum of 30 minutes before centrifugation, The recommended centrifugation conditions are
1,100-1,300 RCF (relative centrifuge force or g) for 10 or 15 minutes (depending on the tube
catalog number).

Routine Chemistry Analytes
A study was conducted to evaluate equivalence between the BD Vacutainer® Serum
Separator (SST™) Blood Collection Tubes (5.0 and 7.5 mL) and Greiner Bio-One
Vacuette® Z Serum Separator Clot Activator Blood Collection Tubes (5.0 mL and 7.0 mL,
respectively) for testing representative chemistry analytes.
A total of 168 participants were enrolled in the study. Blood was collected from each
participant into the required study tubes using standard phlebotomy techniques. In addition,
contrived samples were prepared in an effort to obtain results that spanned the analytical
measurement range for the tested analytes.
Samples were tested on two different instrument platforms (Beckman Coulter UniCel DxC
AU480 and Roche cobas Integra 400+). For each analyte and tube comparison, data was
analyzed using Passing Bablok (PB), Deming (D) or weighted Deming (WD) regression.
Biases between tube types were estimated with 95% confidence intervals. Regression
analyses for a representative tube using each instrument platform are provided in the tables
below.

Special Chemistry Analytes and Cardiac Markers (PAS-18SUST028)
A study was conducted to evaluate the equivalence of BD Vacutainer® Serum Separator
(SST™) Blood Collection Tubes (5.0 and 7.5 mL) in comparison with Greiner Bio-One
Vacuette® Z Serum Separator Clot Activator Blood Collection Tubes (5.0 mL and 7.0 mL,
respectively) for testing special chemistry analytes and cardiac markers.
A total of 495 participants were enrolled in the study. Blood was collected from each
participant into the required study tubes using standard phlebotomy techniques. In addition,
contrived samples were prepared in an effort to cover the analytical measurement range.
Testing was initiated within four hours of sample collection.
Samples were tested on at least two different instrument platforms for each analyte tested:

Therapeutic Drug Monitoring:
A study was conducted to evaluate the equivalence of BD Vacutainer® Serum Separator
(SST™) Blood Collection Tubes (5.0 and 7.5 mL) in comparison with Greiner Bio-One
Vacuette® Z Serum Separator Clot Activator Blood Collection Tubes (5.0 mL and 7.0 mL,
respectively) for therapeutic drugs. The following therapeutic drug assays were tested:
Acetaminophen, Valproic acid, and Vancomycin. In addition, contrived samples were
prepared in an effort to cover the analytical measurement range. Testing of each drug was
performed on the Beckman Coulter DxC 680i and Roche Cobas® 6000. For each analyte and
tube comparison, Deming Regression (weighted or unweighted) or Passing-Bablok
Regression was used. Representative data is provided below.

To mitigate the risk of inaccurate test results for hydrophobic drugs, the following statement
has been added to the labeling:
“Hydrophobic drugs have been known to adsorb to the gel of gel separator tubes, which may
result in lower measured drug concentrations. However, these effects depend on various
factors including the chemical and physical properties of the drug, contact time with the
gel, volume of the sample on the gel, storage temperature, and gel type. Users should
consider these factors when evaluating the use of gel separator tubes for drug testing and
monitoring. See Drug Adsorption in the References Section.”
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Not applicable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
