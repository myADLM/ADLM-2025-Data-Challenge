D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems using VITEK 2 Systems 9.03 software
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-GP Daptomycin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 16
(equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The MIC result range for the
VITEK 2 AST-GP Daptomycin test is ≤0.12 - ≥8 µg/mL. For all species, the MIC result range
indicates that the VITEK 2 system is capable of producing the following MIC results ≤0.12,
0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and ≥8 µg/mL for AST-GP Daptomycin test. This means the VITEK 2 systems
does not provide results lower than 0.12 µg/mL, or greater than 8 µg/mL for the AST-GP
Daptomycin test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

evaluated during review of K091126 and was determined to be acceptable.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Quality Control (QC) testing, Inoculum and Growth failure for the VITEK 2 Gram Positive
Daptomycin were performed in support of clearance of K091126 and were determined
acceptable. QC testing specific to the changes in breakpoints was not performed in the current
submission since the QC ranges used in K091123 were either unchanged (E. faecalis ATCC
29212) or narrowed (S. aureus ATCC 29213; range expanded from 0.25 – 1 μg/mL to 0.12 - 1
μg/mL) and therefore would not negatively impact QC performance. QC results with unchanged
and expanded QC ranges are shown in Table 1.
In summary, the QC organisms recommended by both the FDA and CLSI, namely E. faecalis
ATCC 29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213, were tested using the reference broth microdilution
(BMD) method as well as the VITEK 2 GP Daptomycin by the automatic and the manual
dilution methods during the clinical study a minimum 20 times/site. QC results for the VITEK 2
Daptomycin were within the expected results range >95% of the time for both automatic and
manual dilution modes of the VITEK 2, which is acceptable.

The VITEK 2 AST-GP Daptomycin (≤0.12 - ≥8 µg/mL) which was originally cleared in
K091126, included indications for Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible strains only) and
Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) tested with the VITEK 2 auto
dilution and the VITEK 2 manual dilution and compared to the CLSI broth microdilution
reference method.
The performance of the VITEK 2 AST-GP Daptomycin card with Enterococcus faecalis using
revised interpretive criteria currently recognized by FDA for both vancomycin-susceptible and
vancomycin-resistant isolates was evaluated in the current submission using data obtained in
support of K091126.

Since there was no change in the design or the daptomycin dilution range of the VITEK 2 AST-
ST card, the performance evaluation was achieved via re-analysis of the MIC data of the original
510(k) submission (K091126). For this review, the current daptomycin interpretive criteria are
applied to E. faecalis according to the FDA STIC webpage.
A total of 270 (clinical and challenge) E. faecalis isolates were tested using the VITEK 2 with
automatic dilution. The isolates included 240 clinical isolates and 30 challenge isolates.
Although the 270 isolates were included in studies reported in the original daptomycin
submission (K091126), the original decision summary evaluated a total of only 196 clinical and
challenge E. faecalis isolates. This was because 44 vancomycin-resistant isolates of E. faecalis
were excluded from the final analysis due to a lack of recognized breakpoints at that time. These
isolates are included in the current analysis.
Results of the re-analyzed 270 E. faecalis clinical and challenge isolates tested by the auto-
dilution method are summarized in Table 2. Original data obtained with S. aureus were not
reanalyzed since the interpretive criteria remain unchanged since the original submission.
The VITEK 2 system with the manual dilution method results of the reanalyzed challenge data
with updated E. faecalis interpretive data are summarized in Table 3.

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the MIC result of the reference method and
that of the VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results
are those that are on scale for both the VITEK 2 test card and the reference method or those in which an off scale
result is at least two doubling dilutions from the on scale result. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the
interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK 2 test card.
The combined Essential Agreement (EA) is >90% which is acceptable, as described in the “Class
II Special Control Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems;
Guidance for Industry and FDA, August 2009” (AST guidance).

The updated breakpoints for E. faecalis lowered the susceptible breakpoint by one two-fold
dilution to ≤2 (S), and introduced breakpoints for intermediate (4) and resistant (≥8) categories.
Applying the updated breakpoints for E. faecalis reduced the combined Category Agreement
(CA) from 97.4% to 84.4%. This is due to the new intermediate category and increase in the
number of test results (from 196 isolates analyzed for the predicate in K091126 to 270 isolates
analyzed in the current submission). There were 41 minor errors (15.2%), one very major error
(0.4%), and no major errors.
The AST Guidance indicates that a CA of <90% may be acceptable if the EA of evaluable results
is very good and the majority of discrepancies are minor. Since a majority of the categorical
errors were minor and the EA of evaluable results is >90%, the following limitation is added to
the package insert to address the low CA, in addition to the previously determined unacceptable
performance when testing Streptococcus agalactiae:
Perform an alternative method of testing prior to reporting of results for the following
antibiotic/organism combination(s):
Daptomycin (dap02n): Enterococcus faecalis when the VITEK 2 MIC is 4μg/mL due to
the occurrence of minor errors resulting in a category agreement below 90%;

for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those found in the
indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of susceptibility
information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for specific antimicrobial
drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.
MIC Trending Analysis
A trending analysis was performed using the combined (challenge and clinical) data obtained in
K091126 from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method for all E. faecalis isolates.
This trending calculation takes into account the MIC values that are determined to be one or
more doubling dilutions lower or higher than the reference method irrespective of whether the
device MIC values are on-scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at
least one dilution higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not
considered in the trending analysis.
Evidence of trending is determined to occur when the difference between the percentage of
isolates with higher vs. lower readings is > 30% and for which the confidence interval is
determined to be statistically significant. If trending shows higher or lower MIC values
compared to the reference, this must be addressed in the labeling.
No trending was observed with E. faecalis. For completeness, although not included in
K091126, the trending analysis for S. aureus has been calculated and included in Table 4.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device when evaluated with
the current FDA-recognized daptomycin breakpoints
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive criteria
(i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was reviewed and
accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in response to
breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.htm.
The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux intends to use
to evaluate the VITEK 2 System with daptomycin when revised breakpoints for daptomycin are
published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the submission
indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the daptomycin device label to
include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-evaluation of data in this
premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined by their
evaluation.
