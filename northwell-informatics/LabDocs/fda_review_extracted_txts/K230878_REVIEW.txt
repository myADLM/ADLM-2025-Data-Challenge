IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The QScout system is intended for in vitro diagnostic use in screening patient populations found
in clinical laboratories and point-of-care (POC) settings. The QScout system is a quantitative
multi-parameter automated hematology analyzer that provides results for complete blood count
(CBC) parameters with a 6-part differential. It includes the QScout Lab analyzer, the QScout
RLD (Rapid Leukocyte Differential) test, software, and handheld barcode scanner. The QScout
Lab is a tabletop automated hematology analyzer operated through a touch screen interface. The
QScout RLD test package contains the reagents to run the test and the port to which the blood
sample is dispensed. The system is supplied with a Barcode Scanner and stand for the scanner.
The QScout system reports white blood cell count and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and
enumerates and classifies six white blood cell types including neutrophils, lymphocytes,
monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and immature granulocytes.
B Principle of Operation:
The QScout RLD test includes a microfluidic chamber of predetermined volume containing a
dried reagent of organic compounds to stain and fluoresce white blood cells. Venous whole
K230878 - Page 2 of 14

--- Page 3 ---
blood is transferred manually using a pipette capable of transferring 10μL to the QScout RLD
test where cells mix with the reagent. The QScout RLD test is inserted into the QScout Lab, a
quantitative multi-parameter automated hematology analyzer, where an optical imaging system
takes images of the test chamber. A fixed (locked) machine vision algorithm identifies cells from
the images in real time. When analysis is complete, the results are displayed on the screen and
can be printed.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
QScout Lab
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is performed by manual keyboard entry or use of a barcode reader.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The QScout system can be used with venous anticoagulated whole blood samples collected
in K EDTA or K EDTA tubes. Venous whole blood samples are collected into K EDTA or
2 3 2
K EDTA tubes using each user facility’s standard procedure. Venous whole blood should be
3
sufficiently mixed and stored at room temperature for less than three (3) hours before use.
Venous whole blood is transferred manually using a pipette capable of transferring 10 μL.
4. Calibration:
The QScout Lab device is factory calibrated prior to shipping to the end user, and no further
calibration is needed.
5. Quality Control:
QScout BCS Control is a three-level biological quality control solution which is available to
monitor system performance over time. This includes low, normal, and high levels prepared
from bovine and porcine leukocytes with human erythrocytes suspended in a plasma-like
solution. The biological controls are run every seven (7) days.
A two-level synthetic bead control solution is available to monitor counting capability and
optical system performance metrics of the QScout Lab analyzer. The synthetic controls
should be run weekly.
Both quality control types are produced by AAD, who can be contacted to order
replacements.

b) Reproducibility: The study was conducted at three (3) sites (2 POC and 1 clinical lab),
over five (5) days with two (2) runs per day and three (3) replicates per run using QScout
BCS Hematology Control (a 3-level control set) comprising low, normal and high levels
of measurands. Throughout the study, three (3) QScout Lab analyzers and six (6) lots of
the QScout RLD test cartridges were utilized by a total of eight (8) operators. The data
was used to calculate between-day, between-run, between-site (includes variability of
different systems and operators), and reproducibility (total precision), using a nested
ANOVA model for statistical analysis. For each reported parameter and for each level of
control tested, the mean, SD and %CV were calculated. All components of calculated
variation met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

2. Linearity: Linearity was determined for WBC using venous K2EDTA whole blood. A
linearity panel of 10 concentrations were tested between 8 to 14 times. The weighted least
squares (WLS) analysis was used to assess linearity. Linearity was established between a
range of 0.5 to 60 x103/μL for WBC.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference: Interference studies for glucose, hemolysate, lipemia
(triglyceride-rich lipoproteins), conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, total protein,
and thrombocytosis were performed on the QScout system, using prepared low-normal and
high-normal WBC concentration samples collected from healthy donor whole blood in
K2EDTA or K3EDTA anticoagulated vacutainer tubes. Samples were tested in five to ten
(5–10) replicates on one of three analyzers using three (3) RLD test lots. The difference from
control was deemed acceptable if it was ≤ 10%.
The results of the interference studies demonstrated for WBC that:
• There was no significant glucose interference up to a concentration of 1000 mg/dL.
• There was no significant hemolysate interference up to a concentration of 1000
mg/dL.
• There was no significant lipemia interference up to a concentration of 1500 mg/dL.
• There was no significant conjugated bilirubin interference at a concentration of 40
mg/dL.
• There was no significant unconjugated bilirubin interference up to a concentration of
20 mg/dL.
• There was no significant total protein interference up to a concentration of 12.3 g/dL.
• There was no significant thrombocytosis interference up to a concentration of 750 x
103 platelets/μL.
Nucleated Red Blood Cells (nRBCs): For nRBCs the QScout system raises a flag in the
presence of NRBCs ≥ 0.56 per 100 WBC. At levels lower than the threshold, there is no
interference with WBC differential parameters. For levels above the threshold, nRBC is
flagged and excluded from the WBC differential.
4. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Sample Stability: Sample stability was determined with 11 freshly collected venous
normal and abnormal blood samples. The venous blood samples were collected into
K EDTA or K EDTA tubes and analyzed immediately (within one hour, baseline). The
2 3
samples were subsequently kept at room temperature (20–25°C) and were analyzed
again, with seven to nine (7–9) replicates at timepoints 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours. The data
supports a sample stability claim of three (3) hours at room temperature.
b) QScout RLD Shelf-Life Stability: Six (6) lots of QScout RLD tests were stored out of
direct sunlight at 18-32°C in heat-sealed mylar packaging with testing at 2-week, 4-week,
and 2-, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-, 18-, and 19-month timepoints. At each timepoint, four (4)
replicates each of a three-level biological control (low, normal, high) were run on one (1)
QScout Lab analyzer for each of the six QScout RLD test lots. The study is ongoing, and
the current data supports a shelf-life stability of 1 month.
c) Transport Stability: One (1) QScout RLD test lot underwent conditioning to simulate
transport in accordance with ASTM D7386 and temperature cycling. This involved
exposing QScout RLD tests to hazards occurring during transport, such as manual
handling, vibration, and altitude in accordance with ASTM D7386. RLD test lot then
K230878 - Page 9 of 14

--- Page 10 ---
underwent temperature cycling where the test lot was at room temperature then three (3)
days at 38°C followed by 24 hours at 18°C and finally at room temperature to simulate
the temperatures expected during shipment. The test kit maintained functionality and
expected analytical results during shipment.
d) QScout RLD In-Use Stability: The study was conducted to establish in-use stability of
the QScout RLD test when the QScout RLD test is removed from the storage box and
stored at the recommended storage conditions. Two (2) lots of RLD tests were tested.
Each test lot was stored at 18–32°C and tested at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days, and then
evaluated using venous whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA or K3EDTA tubes.
The data supports the in-use stability for RLD tests for five (5) days.
e) QScout BCS Control Shelf-life stability: Three (3) levels (low, normal, high) were stored
at 2–8°C. Three (3) lots were evaluated with two (2) replicates per level per lot of BCS
control on one QScout Lab at defined timepoints. The study supports 105 days of shelf-
life stability for QScout BCS Control stored upright at 2–8°C.
f) QScout BCS Control In-Use stability: Four (4) replicates of each control level (3 levels-
low, normal, high) were measured on a single QScout Lab using a single lot of QScout
RLD at 0, 4, 7, 11, 14, and 15 days. The study supports 14 days of in-use stability for
QScout BCS Control.
g) Calibration Traceability: The QScout Lab WBC calibration process used the Beckman
Coulter Z2 particle counter as the reference instrument. The calibration process assigns a
reference value (R) to a fresh whole blood sample in the normal WBC range of 4.0 – 12.0
x103/µL. In parallel, the whole blood samples were run on four (4) QScout Lab analyzers
with 30 replicates and the mean WBC is calculated of which the value is being adjusted
by calibration (C). The mean calibration factor across the three fresh whole blood
samples is applied to the QScout Lab. The calibration traceability met the acceptance
criteria that all values must be within +/-5% of . Calibration
stability is ongoing and will be evaluated over 5 years. Testing will be conducted on Day
0, at months 1, 𝑐𝑐2𝑐𝑐, 𝑐𝑐a𝑐𝑐n𝑐𝑐d𝑐𝑐 3𝑐𝑐 𝑐𝑐after Day 0, and then quarterly up𝑐𝑐 t𝑐𝑐o𝑐𝑐 t𝑐𝑐h𝑐𝑐e 𝑐𝑐f𝑐𝑐ir𝑐𝑐s𝑐𝑐t q𝑐𝑐u𝑐𝑐a𝑐𝑐rter of the sixth
year. The current data provided is for 1 month and supports stability < 1 month.
5. Detection Limit: The Limit of blank (LoB), Limit of detection (LoD), and limit of
quantitation (LoQ) for WBC was determined.
The LoB was determined using five (5) plasma samples assayed six times (6x) on two (2)
QScout Lab devices using two (2) QScout RLD lots for a total of 60 measurements for each
lot. The LoB for WBC was determined to be 0.02 x103/μL.
LoD was determined using five (5) low level samples from K3EDTA venous whole blood.
Each of the prepared samples was assayed six times (6x) on each of the two (2) QScout Lab
devices using two (2) QScout RLD lots for a total of 60 measurements for each lot. The LoD
for WBC was determined to be 0.08 x103/μL.
K230878 - Page 10 of 14

--- Page 11 ---
LoQ for was determined using four (4) low level samples from native venous whole blood.
Each of the prepared samples was assayed five times (5x) on each of the two (2) QScout Lab
devices using two (2) QScout RLD lots for a total of 40 measurements for each lot. The LoQ
for WBC was determined to be 0.38 x103/μL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed at one (1) clinical laboratory site and seven (7)
point-of-care (POC) sites with 396 venous blood specimens collected in K EDTA or
2
K EDTA tubes. The study included normal and pathological samples to assess the QScout
3
Lab/RLD system performance across the analytical measurement ranges (AMRs) as well as
at medical decision points. Samples were obtained from patient >18 years of age with 12 of
the 396 samples contrived to cover the entire AMR. The pathological samples included the
following conditions: allergic reaction, anemia, autoimmune / rheumatological diseases, B12
or folate deficiency, bacterial infection, cardiovascular diseases, chronic inflammation,
hemoglobinopathies / hereditary RBC diseases, iron deficiency, acute and chronic leukemias
(lymphocytic or myelocytic), lymphoma, liver disease, myelodysplastic syndromes,
respiratory diseases, severe trauma or bleeding due to surgery or childbirth, solid tumor or
other oncological conditions, and viral infections. Each blood sample was analyzed in singlet
on the QScout Lab /RLD and in duplicate on the Beckman Coulter UniCel DxH 800 (manual
microscopy for IGs), but only the first replicate results was used for all data analyses. Bias
was determined based on the results of the Bland-Altman regression model. For the
regression analysis with 95% confidence intervals (CI) Deming (IG#) and Passing-Bablok
(all others) regression were used to determine by all sites combined. All results were within
the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

2. Matrix Comparison:
The matrix comparison study was conducted to assess the comparison of K EDTA venous
3
whole blood and K EDTA venous whole blood on the QScout Lab. A total of 40 paired
2
patient venous whole blood samples were collected from each participant. The study was
conducted with one (1) replicate per sample at three (3) sites with trained operators.
Weighted Deming regression analysis was performed, and results were within the pre-
defined acceptance criteria, demonstrating the equivalency between K EDTA and K EDTA
2 3
whole blood.
D Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The WBC flagging capability was evaluated for QScout by comparing to the WBC
differential results obtained by the microscopic 400-cell manual differential reference method
(2 slides/200 cells counted per slide) for 100 samples qualified as normal and 100 samples of
various abnormalities. The study was conducted by trained operators. Three blood film slides

were prepared for each sample for manual measurement. Two types of abnormalities were
evaluated: (1) distributional abnormal samples, which are samples where the quantity of at
least one of the parameters resides outside of the normal concentrations, and (2)
morphological abnormal samples, which includes atypical cell features, blasts, nucleated red
blood cells (NRBC), and atypical/variant lymphocytes contained in ordinary blood samples.
Overall agreement, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated with 95% confidence intervals
for distributional flagging, morphological flagging, and overall flagging performance.

E Clinical Cut-Off:
Not Applicable.
F Expected Values/Reference Range:
A reference interval study was conducted to establish adult reference intervals for all QScout
system parameters. The study was performed using venous whole blood samples collected from
265 (139 female and 126 male) apparently healthy adults (≥ 18 years) at six (6) sites. Five (5)
QScout Labs, 24 RLD test lots, and eight (8) operators were used in the study. The lower and
upper limits of the 95% reference intervals were determined based on the 2.5th and 97.5th
percentiles of measurements for each sex group, respectively.
