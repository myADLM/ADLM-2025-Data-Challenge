IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Sysmex XQ-Series (XQ-320) automated hematology analyzer is a multi-parameter
hematology analyzer intended for in vitro diagnostic use in screening patient populations found
in clinical laboratories. The XQ-320 analyzer classifies and enumerates whole blood parameters
on whole blood samples collected in K or K EDTA anticoagulant. The XQ-320 analyzer
2 3
consists of one principal unit, which aspirates and dispenses diluent to prepare blood dilutions
and analyzes whole blood samples. The XQ-320 analyzer uses a built-in monitor to operate the
analyzer and process data. The operator mixes the sample manually, then introduces the sample
tube to the aspiration pipette with the cap off, and presses the start switch to execute aspiration
and analysis.
The XQ-320 automated hematology analyzer consists of two principal analysis modes:
1. Whole Blood Analysis Mode is used for testing K EDTA or K EDTA whole blood samples.
2 3
2. Pre-Dilution Analysis Mode is used for testing of microvolumes of K EDTA or K EDTA
2 3
whole blood samples. Venous whole blood containing anticoagulant is directly added to
diluent to create a 1:7 dilution (1 part sample and 6 parts diluent).
B Principle of Operation:
The XQ-320 analyzer performs analysis by means of Direct Current (DC) detection method and
non-cyanide hemoglobin (HGB) analysis method (colorimetric method). The sample is aspirated,
measured, and delivered into a mixing chamber where it is diluted. Then lysing reagent is added
to dissolve red cells and release the hemoglobin. The lysed sample is transferred to the
transducer, where the volume and number of blood cells are determined by the DC detection

--- Page 3 ---
method. Then remaining parameters are calculated by a microprocessor, based upon the
measured values.
The leukocyte 3-part differential is determined by size particle distribution. WBC particle size
distribution is separated into small white blood cells, medium white blood cells, and large white
blood cells by the 3-fractional method.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Sysmex XQ-Series (XQ-320) Automated Hematology Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Sample number is manually entered or scanned using a handheld barcode reader.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Venous and capillary whole blood samples are collected in K or K EDTA anticoagulant.
2 3
Samples should be analyzed within 4 hours after collection. If the sample is not analyzed
within 4 hours, the sample should be stored at 2–8°C for 24 hours. Refrigerated samples
should remain at room temperature for at least 15 minutes prior to analysis. Perform gentle
inversion prior to analysis.
4. Calibration:
The SCS-1000 Calibrator (K943268) is used for calibration of the instrument for WBC,
RBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT. Calibration is performed as needed (e.g., when QC data is
fluctuating) to ensure accuracy of the system.
5. Quality Control:
There are three levels of quality control material (low, normal, and high; EIGHTCHECK-
3WP X-TRA, K852992) to be used to monitor the performance of the XQ-320 analyzer.
Quality control should be performed at the appropriate timing according to the operation of
the facility.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Repeatability Study
Repeatability Study
Within-run repeatability studies were performed for all claimed parameters using residual
venous whole blood samples collected in K2EDTA anticoagulant. Samples included in the
study targeted the low, normal, and upper end of the analytical measuring range of direct
measured parameters (WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, and PLT) and medical decision levels
(MDLs) of WBC and PLT parameters. Each sample was tested in one run with ten replicates
by the same operator on the same day in the whole blood mode at four U.S. sites (three
external clinical sites and one internal site). A total of 11 operators were enrolled across the
sites. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation were calculated for
each parameter. All results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

Reproducibility
A reproducibility studies was performed at three U.S. clinical sites. The study was performed
over five days with three Sysmex XQ-320 Automated Hematology Analyzers (one per site)
using a single calibrator and one lot of quality control materials (low, normal, high) by seven
operators. Two runs per day and three replicates per run were performed at each site for each
control level. The SD and %CV were calculated for within-run, between-run, between-day,
between-site, and total imprecision for each control level. All results met pre-defined acceptance
criteria.

2. Linearity:
Linearity testing by serial dilution was conducted at one internal site using three Sysmex XQ-
320 Automated Hematology Analyzers. A single calibrator lot, control material (WRP
CHECK; K960557) and system diluent (CELLPACK) were used to create serial dilutions of
sample concentration which spanned the target measurement range of all direct measured
parameters (WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT). Each sample dilutions were measured in
replicates of three. All results met predefined acceptance criteria.

4. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Sample Stability:
The evaluation of whole blood sample stability was conducted at one site using twenty (10
normal and 10 abnormal) residual K EDTA whole blood samples. Samples were split into
2
two sets stored at room temperature (18–26°C) and refrigerated temperature (2–8°C). Room
temperature samples were tested in duplicate at baseline (T0), 4, 8, 12, and 13 hours and
refrigerated samples were tested at baseline T0, 8, 12, 24, and 25 hours in singlet. The mean,
standard deviation, mean difference and percent difference from the baseline mean of each
sample result were calculated for each parameter at each time interval for both conditions.
All results were within the established acceptance criteria. The data support a whole blood
sample stability of 12 hours at room temperature (18–26°C) and 24 hours at refrigerated
temperature (2–8°C).
5. Detection Limit:
Limits of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
determined for the direct measured WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT parameters on the
Sysmex XQ-320 Automated Hematology Analyzer.
In LoB testing, four blank samples were measured in replicates of five, over a period of three
days using two reagent lots, to yield 120 total measurement results per parameter. To
determine the LoD and LoQ, four low concentration samples were analyzed on the Sysmex
XN-10 automated hematology analyzer (K112605) to assign the reference value. The low-
level samples were then measured in replicates of five over a period of three days using two
reagent lots, to yield 120 total measurement results per parameter.
The results of the LoB, LoD, and LoQ are provided in the table below.
Parameter LoB LoD LoQ
WBC (x106/µL) 0.00 0.03 0.17

Carryover on the Sysmex XQ-320 Automated Hematology analyzer was evaluated by
assaying venous whole blood collected in K EDTA with high WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, and
2
PLT counts three consecutive times followed immediately by testing samples with low target
values around medical decision levels three consecutive times. Three sets of carryover
sequences were run for each measurand in the whole blood mode at three clinical sites. The
results of the carryover study demonstrated the Sysmex XQ-320 Automated Hematology
Analyzer is not impacted by carryover.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted to assess the performance of the Sysmex XQ-320
Automated Hematology analyzer compared to the predicate device, Sysmex XN-10
(K112605). A total of 628 (611 native and 17 contrived) residual and prospectively collected
venous whole blood samples in K2EDTA anticoagulant from pediatrics (<21 years) and adult
(≥21 years) subjects including a variety of disease states (e.g., chronic leukemia
(lymphocytic), pathological WBCs, hepatocellular carcinoma, bacterial infection, acute
encephalopathy etc.) were enrolled in the study. Sample demographics from all sites included
172 pediatric subjects and 433 adults and 23 subjects with age not reported. Of this total,
43.8% were male, 52.2% female and 4.0% with sex not reported. The results of the
regression analyses including 95% confidence interval (CI) for the slope, intercept and
correlation coefficient were computed for each parameter using the Deming method with
results from the Sysmex XQ-320 Automated Hematology Analyzer against the results from
the Sysmex XN-10 analyzer. All results were within predefined acceptance criteria.

2. Matrix Studies
Anticoagulant Comparison Study (K EDTA versus K EDTA) – Whole Blood
2 3
Anticoagulant comparison study was performed to evaluate comparability between K EDTA
2
versus K EDTA anticoagulated whole blood samples on the Sysmex XQ-320 Automated
3
Hematology analyzer. A total of 53 paired whole blood samples (K EDTA versus K EDTA)
2 3
were collected from adult (>21 years) donors. The samples were run in singlet within 8 hours
of collection in the whole blood mode. The results from the K EDTA whole blood samples
2
were compared to the corresponding results of the K EDTA sample for the same donor. The
3
results of the regression analysis and bias estimates between K EDTA versus K EDTA
2 3
anticoagulated whole blood samples met the acceptance criteria for all applicable parameters
and suggest there is no difference in performance between K EDTA and K EDTA whole
2 3
blood samples.
Comparison of Venous Whole Blood versus Capillary Whole Blood
A study was performed to evaluate comparability between venous whole blood and capillary
whole blood samples on the Sysmex XQ-320 Automated Hematology analyzer. A total of 42
paired venous whole blood and capillary whole blood samples (K EDTA) were drawn from
2
adult (>21 years) donors for this study. The venous whole blood sample results were
compared to the corresponding results of the capillary sample for the same donor. The results
of the regression analysis and bias estimates met the acceptance criteria for all applicable
parameters and suggest there is no difference in performance between venous whole blood
and capillary whole blood samples.
Whole Blood K EDTA Normal Tube versus Micro-collection tube
2
A comparison study of K EDTA tubes and micro-collection tubes without anticoagulant
2
were performed to determine the presence or absence of matrix effect between the sample
tubes on the Sysmex XQ-320 Automated Hematology analyzer. A total of 183 residual
K EDTA (4 mL tubes) whole blood samples with analyte concentrations spanning the
2
analytical measuring range were run in singlet in the whole blood mode. Within two hours of
analysis of the 4 mL K EDTA tubes, the samples were remixed, then transferred to micro
2
collection tubes (without anticoagulant additive), then analyzed in singlet in the whole blood
mode. The results from the K EDTA whole blood samples were compared to the
2
corresponding results of the micro-collection sample tube for the same patient sample. The

Sysmex XQ-320 Automated Hematology Analyzer.
Whole Blood K EDTA mode versus Predilute mode
2
A total of 35 residual K EDTA (4 mL tubes) anticoagulated whole blood samples were
2
evaluated to determine comparability between the whole blood and predilute mode on
Sysmex XQ-320 Automated Hematology analyzer. Following the analysis of the whole
blood samples, a 1:7 predilute sample was prepared for each whole blood sample by adding
120 µL of system diluent (CELLPACK) and 20 µL of whole blood into plain micro-
collection tubes. The prediluted samples were thoroughly mixed by gentle inversion and run
in the predilute mode of the Sysmex XQ-320 Automated Hematology Analyzer with caps
off. The results from the predilute mode are automatically multiplied by 7 before results are
displayed, therefore no additional calculation is required. The results from the K EDTA
2
whole blood samples were compared to the corresponding results of the prediluted sample
for the same patient sample. The results of the regression analysis and bias estimates met the
acceptance criteria for all applicable parameters.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Sensitivity/specificity studies were conducted to evaluate the flagging capabilities of the
Sysmex XQ-320 Automated Hematology analyzer using patient samples representing a
variety of abnormal conditions in comparison to manual differential counts and peripheral
blood smear review by experienced examiners using light microscopy (reference method) at
each of the three external clinical sites and one internal site from the method comparison
study. Three blood film slides were prepared for each sample for manual measurement. The
flagging results from the Sysmex XQ-320 Automated Hematology Analyzers for normal (no
flags) and abnormal (flags present) were compared to manual differential counts and
peripheral blood smear review using light microscopy. A 2x2 table was constructed to
determine sensitivity and specificity for both distributional and morphological abnormalities.
The sample size (N), number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negative (TN),
false negatives (FN), sensitivity, specificity, and overall percent agreement are presented in
the following table.

D Expected Values/Reference Range:
Verification of Adult Reference Intervals
Verification of adult reference intervals was conducted on the Sysmex XQ-320 Automated
Hematology analyzer to demonstrate comparability of whole blood reference intervals for an
adult male and female population (>21 years) to ranges established for the Sysmex pocH-100i
(K032677). Ninety-nine samples (56 females and 43 males) were tested and compared to pre-
established reference intervals to determine if the ranges were applicable for use with the
Sysmex XQ-320 Automated Hematology analyzer. The results of the proposed reference
intervals overlapped the 95% confidence intervals (lower and upper limit) of the adult male and
female and were determined to be acceptable.
Verification of Pediatric Reference Intervals
Using Pediatric Reference Interval literature source (Wong, E., Brugnara, C., Straseski, J.,
Kellogg, M., & Adeli, K. 2021. Pediatric Reference Intervals. 8th ed., Hematology Tests (pp.
209-267), Academic Press.), reference interval verification study was performed for the pediatric
population. A total of 226 pediatric samples including each subpopulation: 34 neonates (birth–1
month); 63 infants (>1 month–2 years); 63 children (>2 years–12 years); and 66 adolescents
(>12 years–21 years) were used in the study. The results of the proposed reference intervals
overlapped the 95% confidence intervals (lower and upper limit) of the pediatric datasets and
were determined to be acceptable.
