III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Premier HpSA Flex enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is an in vitro qualitative procedure for the
detection of Helicobacter pylori antigens in human stool. The test is intended for use with
unpreserved stool specimens or preserved stool specimens in transport media. Test results are
intended to aid in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection and to monitor response during and post-
therapy in patients. Accepted medical practice recommends that testing by any current method, to
confirm eradication, be done at least four weeks following completion of therapy.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Visual determination of Assay endpoint needs no special instrument. However, if the optional
spectrophotometric determination is chosen, endpoint reading of the assay requires a generic
spectrophotometric microplate reader capable of recording absorbance values at 450 nm and
optionally at 630 nm for wavelength correction.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Premier HpSA Flex assay represents a modification of the sponsor’s previously FDA-cleared
Premier Platinum HpSA PLUS assay (K182559). The modification is the addition of a new sample
type claim (i.e., human stool specimens preserved in specific transport media, namely, Cary-Blair
or Culture and Sensitivity (C&S) transport media) to the intended use of the previously cleared
device (K182559). Both the subject and predicate devices are qualitative, in vitro diagnostic tests
for the detection of Helicobacter pylori antigens present in human stool specimens.
B Principle of Operation:
The Premier HpSA Flex test is a microwell-based enzyme immunoassay that detects H. pylori
antigens from human stool specimens. Stool specimen may be either unpreserved or preserved in
Cary-Blair or Culture and Sensitivity (C&S) transport media. The test utilizes a plurality (mixture)
of monoclonal anti-H. pylori capture antibodies adsorbed to microwells. Diluted patient samples
and an enzyme conjugate reagent are added to the microwells and incubated for one hour at room
temperature. A wash is performed to remove unbound material. Substrate is added and incubated
for 10 minutes at room temperature. Color develops by reaction with the bound enzyme, indicating
the presence of H. pylori antigen. Stop solution is added and the results are interpreted visually or
spectrophotometrically. No calculations are required, and the visible change from colorless to
K230901 - Page 2 of 14

--- Page 3 ---
yellow makes the interpretation of results objective and simple. The yellow color may be read with
a spectrophotometer at 450 nm wavelength with or without correction at 630 nm. In addition, the
HpSA test permits assessment of established or novel anti-H. pylori treatment during and post-
therapy to monitor for treatment effectiveness, relapse, or eradication.

VII Performance Characteristics:
A Analytical Performance:
Analytical performance of the subject assay (Premier HpSA Flex) was evaluated using contrived
samples. Briefly, a Bulk Negative Stool (BNS) matrix was prepared by pooling unpreserved stool
specimens from five (5) donors or fewer into small, pooled lots. Purified and pre-quantified H.
pylori flagellar antigen (HpSA) was used to spike the negative stool matrix with known
concentrations to create contrived positive samples. Sample matrix alone served as true negative
samples. The contrived positive and negative samples were then preserved in Remel Cary Blair
(“CB”; ThermoFisher, cat. #R21925) or Para-Pak Culture & Sensitivity transport media (“C&S”;
MBI, cat. #900612) at a volumetric ratio of 1:4 (i.e., 1 part sample in negative stool matrix + 3
parts transport media, respectively).
1. Limit of Detection (LoD) / Analytical Sensitivity:
Analytical sensitivity of the subject assay was estimated in two steps, (i) by estimating the
Limit of Detection (LoD) of the assay using contrived positive human stool samples preserved
in either CB or C&S transport media, and (ii) by determining that the performances of the
assay with either medium are equivalent at near LoD antigen concentrations in samples.

Contrived samples (positives and negatives) were tested in the assay following instructions in
labeling using three (3) kit lots and twenty (20) replicates per sample.
LoD was defined as the lowest concentration of HpSA (calculated as ng of antigen per mL of
preserved stool) that produced positive results ≥ 95% of the time. The LoD for the subject
assay was conservatively determined to be 12 ng HpSA per mL of preserved stool. The
previously established LoD using unpreserved (raw) stool was 4.66 ng/mL.
Further, the equivalence between CB and C&S TM was assessed at LoD and below LoD
antigen concentrations in contrived samples using three (3) kit lots with 20 replicates at each
of these Lot × Concentration (total of 10 testing conditions) for each transport media. CB and
C&S were determined to be equivalent for the preservation of specimens intended to be used
with the subject assay, as shown below in Table 1.

2. Precision/Reproducibility:
A multi-site, blinded study was conducted at three (3) external clinical sites to evaluate the
reproducibility and repeatability of the Premier HpSA Flex device. The testing panels of
contrived stool samples were preserved in C&S transport media. Each panel consisted of
negative stool matrix alone (true negative sample, TN) or matrix spiked with known
concentrations of HpSA to generate high negative (<1X LoD, HN), low positive (2X LoD,
LP), and moderate positive (5X LoD, MP) samples. The panels were stored at ≤ −70oC and
shipped frozen to the study sites.
Three (3) independent sites tested the panels in a blinded fashion, with each site evaluating:
ten (10) panels x four (4) members/panel x three (3) replicates/member = a total of 120
samples. In total, therefore, the study evaluated 360 samples at the three sites combined. Two
(2) technicians participated in the testing at each site. Along with each panel (of 24 samples),
each technician tested a positive and negative control per day, for five (5) days.
Precision assessments evaluated the variabilities of consecutive measurements of the same
sample input between sites, within sites, and within run, as well as the reproducibility of
measurements of each sample over time and experimental conditions. Setting the expected
results to be a qualitative negative or positive, total percent agreement amongst all sites was
for 360 out of 360 samples, i.e., 100% (95% CI: 98.9–100%). Similarly, the total percent

Considering all data points as recommended by the FDA-recognized consensus standard CLSI
EP05-A3 (2014), the Within-Run % CV ranged 14.9–107% and Reproducibility (total % CV)
ranged 29.6–121% across all sites. As expected, the data variability was higher at lower Ag
concentrations (TN and HN). However, there was no instance recorded of unexpected
conversion of a presumed negative to positive or vice versa. All concentrations tested met the
predefined acceptance criteria.
3. Linearity:
Not applicable
4. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Studies were conducted to determine whether substances that may be present in human stool
specimens preserved in CB or C&S TM interfere with results generated by the subject assay
(Premier HpSA Flex). Substances evaluated were those that may reasonably be expected to be
present within patient samples and those that were determined to have the potential to affect
test results.
True negative (negative stool matrix alone) and low positive (2X LoD) specimens were
contrived in triplicate. The target interferent was added to each replicate. Where necessary,
stock solutions of interferent substances were prepared in a diluent (sterile 0.85% saline) prior

to combining with stool samples; the stock concentrations were prepared such that the diluent
volume did not exceed 10% of the stool matrix when combining. Specimen replicates with
added interferents were preserved in C&S transport medium at a ratio of 1:4 (v/v).
The same chemical or biological substances were previously evaluated for interference with
the predicate assay (K182559). Table 3 below lists the potential interferents with their target
concentrations (per 500 µL of patient stool) evaluated with specimens preserved in C&S
transport media.

Each microwell plate of samples tested was analyzed spectrophotometrically at dual
wavelength (A ). External controls (Positive and Negative) were included with each
450−630nm
plate tested. All positive samples (preserved in C&S transport media) tested gave the expected
results indicating that none of the substances evaluated in this study showed interference in the
subject assay at the concentrations tested. All negative samples were also negative.
5. Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity:
Studies were conducted to determine whether micro-organisms that may be present human
stool specimens preserved in CB or C&S transport media non-specifically reacted with the
subject assay. The microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, fungus, and viruses) evaluated in this study
are those that are most likely to be or are possibly present within patient stool specimens and
those could potentially affect assay results.
True negative (negative stool matrix alone) and low positive (2X LoD) specimens were
contrived in triplicate. Relevant bacterial organisms or fungus were tested at final
concentrations of ≥1.0 x 107 CFU/mL, whereas viruses were tested at ≥1.0 x 105 TCID /mL.

For cross-reactivity, the target micro-organisms were added to preserved true negative
replicates; for microbial interference, target micro-organisms were added to preserved low
positive replicates. Where necessary, microbial stock solutions were prepared in sterile 0.85%
saline prior to combining with stool samples; the stock concentrations were prepared such that

All spiked samples (preserved in C&S transport media) were observed to be negative in the
assay, indicating that none of the micro-organisms evaluated in this study showed cross-
reactivity or microbial interference in the subject assay at the concentrations tested. External
controls (Positive and Negative) that were included also produced the expected results.

Storage stability studies:
Analytical storage stability studies were performed with a panel of contrived stool specimens
preserved in CB or C&S transport media to determine acceptable limits for storage and
handling of such preserved specimens. For each transport media type, the panel included a true
negative (TN) sample with unpreserved negative stool matrix, a moderate positive (MP)
sample (5X LoD), three low positive (LP) samples (2X LoD), and a high negative (HN) sample
with antigen at <1X LoD. Antigen concentration for HN sample (7.5 ng/mL) was determined
by testing various dilutions until testing generated results with 10–90% positivity (i.e., 1–9
positives out of 10 replicates) at the given concentration in each transport media. Prior to the
study, all panel members were preserved in CB or C&S transport media at 1:4 (v/v) ratio.
Testing was performed following the instructions for use for the subject device. These
analytical studies are listed below.
a) Preserved specimen storage stability:
An analytical study determined the acceptable limits for storage and handling of human stool
specimens when preserved in CB or C&S transport media and tested with the subject assay.
This study used the contrived and preserved specimens indicated above (i.e., TN, HN, LP, and
MP samples) as a “reference” panel. A separate panel of contrived “clinical” positives was
prepared using archived, preserved clinical positive stool samples with pre-quantified analyte
(HpSA) levels as measured by the assay. These archived preserved stool samples were serially
diluted in cognately preserved (CB or C&S) negative stool matrix and tested to arrive at assay
signals that were equivalent (within ± 2 SD of mean) to those of the reference panel members
LP (designated “2X”) and MP (designated “5X”). Similarly, another archived preserved
clinical positive specimen was serially diluted in cognately preserved negative stool matrix to
create a contrived “clinical” high negative (designated “HN”) sample for which replicates

generated results with 10–90% positivity (i.e., 1–9 assay positives out of 10 replicates in a set)
in each transport media. Finally, archived clinical negative specimens were screened and
preserved in CB or C&S transport media to create a negative (designated “NS”) “clinical”
sample.
After baseline testing (time 0), each preserved sample was subjected to different storage
temperatures and time conditions, and the stored sample aliquots were tested in the subject
assay at designated time points (~106 and 130.5 hours for refrigerated or ambient storage; 10
and 75 days for storage in −20oC and −80oC freezers) using a minimum of 10 replicates per
sample.
When subjected to different temperature conditions as indicated above and then tested in the
assay, the MP, LP, and NS preserved in CB or C&S transport media produced acceptable
results at all timepoints and reliably demonstrated assay signal outputs in alignment with
expectations. For preserved NS samples, baseline results met all acceptance criteria; prolonged
storage at several timepoints resulted in the low analyte (HpSA antigen) content in these
samples being variably detected by the subject immunoassay, as expected. Results from this
study are shown in Table 5.

* Note: samples were stored at 2–8oC for 108 hours and at 19–27oC for 106 hours prior to testing
at these time points.
In summary, specimen stability testing of a panel of clinical specimens diluted in negative stool
matrix and preserved in CB or C&S transport media demonstrated reliably detectable assay
signals when the preserved stool specimens were stored at ambient (19–27oC) or cold (2–8oC)
temperatures for up to 120 hours or at frozen conditions (−20oC and/or −80oC) for up to 14
days. The collective data from this study supported the acceptable storage times and conditions
and demonstrated analyte stability in frozen specimens, which served as the basis for
supporting the use of frozen, archived specimens for the Method Comparison study.
b) Freeze/Thaw:
An analytical study determined the acceptable limits for the freeze / thaw cycling of human
stool specimens when preserved in CB or C&S transport media for testing with the subject
assay. The panel (Neg, HN, LP, and MP) of contrived, preserved stool samples was tested at
baseline (“Time 0”), then subjected to a series of freeze/thaw cycles using a low temperature
(−20oC) freezer (range: −28 to −16oC) or an ultralow (−80oC) freezer (range: −84 to −66oC)
followed by ambient (19–27oC) thawing, and finally tested in the assay with 10–30 replicates
per sample. For preserved Negative, LP (2X LoD), and MP (5X LoD) samples in either
transport media and cycled up to 3 times through freeze/thaw cycles in low-temperature and
ultralow freezers, all samples showed acceptable signal outputs aligned with expectations, and
no significant trend was observed in the average ODs (A ) compared to baseline results.
450-630
For HN samples, whereas the baseline ODs remained within the sponsor’s acceptance criteria
of 10–90% positive signals, when subjected to up to 3 freeze/thaw cycles, the low amount
(<1X LoD) of analyte present in the preserved HN samples (6.5 ng/mL of HpSA in negative
stool matrix) produced only low or no signals as expected. The results are summarized in Table
6 below.

In summary, freeze/thaw stability testing of contrived specimens preserved in CB or C&S
transport media demonstrated no challenges in signal acquisition in the assay when the
preserved specimens were stored frozen (in −20oC and −80oC freezers) and thawed up to a 3rd
time for testing.
Expected Values:
Studies on the epidemiology of H. pylori have shown that this organism is present worldwide.
Gastritis caused by H. pylori has been shown to correlate with age, ethnic background, family
size and socioeconomic class. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in a given population can
vary from 20% to 90%. In patients diagnosed with duodenal ulcers, however, it has been shown
in every age group to be approximately 80%. Currently recommended eradication treatments
have an efficacy rate between 75% and 90%.
The proposed subject assay “Premier HpSA Flex” assay is intended to detect the presence of
H. pylori antigens in unpreserved and preserved human stool specimens. Expected values for
a given population should be determined for each laboratory. The rate of positivity may vary
depending on geographic location, method of specimen collection, handling and
transportation, test employed and general health environment of the patient population under
study.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Comparator Device:
A method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the agreement of the subject assay (i.e.,
Premier HpSA Flex) with an FDA-cleared comparator assay, for use with human stool
specimens preserved in CB or C&S transport media. All specimens enrolled in this study were
de-identified, left-over samples of liquid, semi-solid, or formed human stool, that were
previously collected from symptomatic patients with suspicions of gastroenteritis and
submitted to a clinical laboratory for H. pylori antigen testing under order from a prescribing
healthcare provider as a part of the patients’ medical care. Each specimen was sourced from
one individual patient. De-identified frozen preserved clinical specimens were acceptable for
use in this study since the subject device represents a modification to an existing device. Of
note, originally cleared assay used fresh prospective specimens and provided support for use
of frozen specimens.
From the time of receipt, the specimens were stored frozen, randomized, relabeled, and pre-
screened against both the current clinical diagnostic Standard of Care (SoC) and with an FDA-
cleared device. A total of 182 specimens with 50 positives and 132 negatives successfully
passed pre-screening (with matching SoC and pre-screen device results) and were assigned one
preservative transport medium (CB or C&S). The unpreserved (raw) specimens were
transferred to the transport medium (N=90 in C&S and 92 in CB) prior to being tested with the
subject assay and the comparator.
The study was carried out at a single US site using three (3) kit lots of the subject assay (Lots
601396P167, 601396P168, and 601396P169) following the instructions in the Package Insert.
In parallel, the FDA-cleared comparator assay was performed with the same preserved
specimens on any given day by a separate technician following the assay’s Package Insert. The
results are summarized in Table 7.
