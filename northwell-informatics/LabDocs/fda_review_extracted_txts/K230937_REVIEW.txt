The Alinity ci-series is a System comprised of individual Alinity i or Alinity c
analyzers/processing modules that may be arranged into individual or multimodule
configurations including up to four Alinity i processing modules, up to four Alinity c processing
modules, or a combination of up to four of Alinity i and Alinity c processing modules with a
shared system control module to form a single workstation.
The Alinity c System is a fully automated, random/continuous access, clinical chemistry analyzer

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The GLP systems Track is a modular laboratory automation system (LAS) used to perform
multiple pre-analytical and post-analytical steps to automate sample preparation and distribution
processes in clinical laboratories. These processes include bar code identification of samples,
decapping of samples, centrifugation, aliquoting of samples, transport of samples between
processes (modules), and delivery of samples to one or more Abbott and third Party
commercially available laboratory analyzers, capping of samples, and storage of samples. Each
module includes a built-in touchscreen, a user interface that functions as a central operating
and display element. Due to the modular nature of the LAS, customers may select modules and
configurations to fit their laboratory needs.
Alinity i Total β-hCG Reagent Kit
The Alinity i Total β-hCG Reagent Kit consists of magnetic microbeads coated with anti-β-hCG
monoclonal antibody in TRIS buffer with protein (bovine) stabilizers and anti-hCG monoclonal
antibody labeled with acridinium in MES buffer with protein (bovine) stabilizers. The Reagent
Kit is composed of two cartridges, and each cartridge contains two vials (microparticle antibody
and conjugate antibody) and a spacer (empty cartridge).
B Principle of Operation:
The Alinity i Total β-hCG assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative and qualitative
determination of β-hCG in human serum and plasma using chemiluminescent microparticle
immunoassay (CMIA) technology. Sample and anti-β-hCG coated paramagnetic microparticles
are combined and incubated. The β-hCG present in the sample binds to the anti-β-hCG coated
microparticles. The mixture is washed. Anti-β-hCG acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to
create a reaction mixture and incubated. Following a wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger
Solutions are added. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units
(RLUs). There is a direct relationship between the amount of β-hCG in the sample and the RLUs
detected by the system optics.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
GLP systems Track
2. Specimen Identification:
Barcode identification of patient samples. GLP systems Track reads sample bar codes and
electronically communicates sample identification number to the analyzers.
K230937 - Page 3 of 9

--- Page 4 ---
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The patient’s sample tubes are loaded onto the GLP systems Track Input/Output Module
(IOM) or BulkLoader Module to be centrifuged, de-capped, aliquoted, recapped and stored.
The sample bar codes are read to direct the sample to a specific analyzer.
4. Calibration:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed based on recommendations in CLSI EP09c. The
method comparison study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between results
from specimens that were loaded using the GLP systems Track (investigational method) and
on the same Alinity ci-series where specimens were loaded in the front (comparator method).
A total of 117 native human serum samples spanning the measuring range of the Alinity i
Total β-hCG (beta human chorionic gonadotropin) assay were tested. For both methods (i.e.,
investigational and comparator), samples were tested in singlicate using one lot of reagents,
calibrators, and controls on one Alinity ci-series instrument over the course of three non-
consecutive days. Only samples with results that were within the measuring interval of the
Alinity i Total β-hCG assay were included in the analysis. A Deming regression analysis was
performed using all samples by comparing the result from the investigational method versus
the result from the comparator method. The regression analysis result is summarized in the
table below:
