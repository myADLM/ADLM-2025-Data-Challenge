IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The MeMed BV (“BV Test” or the “Test”) is an In Vitro Diagnostic device that measures in
parallel the concentrations of three non-microbial (host) proteins (TRAIL, IP-10 and CRP) in
serum and venous whole blood samples from adult and pediatric patients presenting to the
emergency department, urgent care center, and with samples collected at hospital admission from
patients with suspected acute bacterial or viral infection. The test consists of an automated
analyzer with built-in hardware and software that conduct chemiluminescence based analyte
measurements of patient serum and venous whole blood samples and their computational
integration (MeMed Key), and a disposable cartridge that contains the reagents and controls
needed to detect the analytes of interest (MeMed BV cartridge). The Test generates an answer to
each sample, with a test run time of approximately 15 minutes.
B Principle of Operation:
The test system is composed of the analyzer (MeMed Key) and the cartridge, and their respective
sub-components. The product is designed to allow straightforward sample-to-answer testing,
with a test run time of approximately 15 minutes.
The patient’s serum or venous whole blood specimen is dispensed by the user into the designated
cartridge area. The users are instructed to fill 100 μL of serum sample or 150µl of venous whole
blood sample, using a pipette. Each single-use cartridge is provided in a package that contains all
K230944 - Page 2 of 17

--- Page 3 ---
necessary components for conducting a single patient test. This consists of the cartridge itself, all
disposables (pipette tips), reagents and a waste collection well. The cartridge assembly contains
both the reagents for the different assays and the pipette tips. The cartridge is a multi-cavity
plastic container that is sealed off with foil and covered with a label on the foil that indicates the
sample type, the test name, indication to the user where to input the sample, required sample
volume, lot number, cartridge expiry date and a barcode with test data and parameters that are
intended to be read by the analyzer.
The cartridge contains the several reagents in separate cavities, which are required to perform the
test. Upon insertion of the cartridge, the analyzer conducts three immunoassays on a single
serum or venous whole blood sample. The cartridge also securely stores all waste materials
collected during the test.
The user inserts the cartridge with sample into the analyzer and is guided by the carriage caddy.
The analyzer auto-reads the cartridge's barcode and verifies that the requested test matches the
cartridge type, cartridge expiration date, and that the calibration curve matches the cartridge lot
number. The analyzer notifies the user when specimen processing is initiated and when the user
should expect the test result.
After the cartridge has been inserted, the carriage caddy system locks and guides the cartridge
during the insertion phase. Once loaded, the cartridge holder is driven by the robot to the left, in
position for processing.
The liquids are handled through the pipettor, which operates through measurement of displaced
air volumes by means of a flow sensor, integrated directly in the pipetting head that is connected
to a high-speed solenoid valve. The flow sensor is based on a differential pressure measurement
across flow restriction. The cartridge is then heated through the heater block. A software-driven
Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control system is used to set and regulate the temperature
of the heater block, using the center thermistor for feedback.
Once the sample has been diluted and mixed with magnetic particles, it is processed by the bead
immobilizer magnet, which generates a high magnetic field strength, and allows both the
reduction of immobilization time and a high percentage of bead retention per immobilization to
be achieved. The sample is then washed and the chemiluminescence step takes place.
The chemiluminescence of the assay is measured by a Photo Multiplier Tube (PMT) Module, a
highly sensitive light detection device. The selected PMT Module has a spectral range which
matches the expected wavelength generated by the chemistry luminescence. When a PMT
reading is required, the software then turns the PMT Module on and a reading is taken. Once
readings have been completed, the software automatically turns the PMT Module off.
Each RLU measurement for each of the analytes is processed and translated to a concentration
measurement using a calibration curve that is generated using calibration materials provided by
MeMed. The process of generating a calibration curve for the modified MeMed BV device can
be accomplished by using a Master curve calibration (MCC); where the 4-parameter logistic (for
IP-10 and CRP) or linear (for TRAIL) calibration is created during cartridge lot manufacturing
and is adjusted periodically based on the measurement of the 3 calibrator solutions as part of the
standard calibration process (utilized for serum and venous whole blood sample types),
compared to the expected RLUs based on the (factory defined) master curve.
K230944 - Page 3 of 17

--- Page 4 ---
When a clinical sample is run, the resulting concentrations are processed to apply a clinical
correction factor, which is pre-determined for each of the analytes. This clinical correction factor
takes care of any matrix-effects (in the serum or venous whole blood) which may impact the
generated signal compared to the calibration curve which is run on recombinant proteins. This
difference is fixed for each of the analytes and is applied as a simple linear correction factor.
When the matrix- effect correction does not follow a simple linear model (as evidenced by
goodness of fit metrics), a piecewise linear model is employed.
For venous whole-blood testing, the clinical correction factor includes a precalculated whole-
blood to serum conversion process, whereby the raw concentrations (in whole-blood) are
converted to serum- equivalent values and corrected using the clinical correction factor. This
process of conversion and correction is applied in one step, encompassing both actions.
Final concentrations for each analyte are then processed to generate a Score result which places
the specimen into one of five distinct bins, with higher score values corresponding to increasing
likelihood of a bacterial infection.
The MeMed BV test result is a score between 0 and 100 derived from computational integration
of the measurements of the three proteins TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP, where low scores are
indicative of viral infection and high score of bacterial infection.
• 0 ≤ score ≤10: High likelihood of viral infection (or other non-bacterial etiology)
• 10 < score <35: Moderate likelihood of viral infection (or other non-bacterial etiology)
• 35 ≤ score ≤65: Equivocal
• 65 < score <90: Moderate likelihood of bacterial infection (or co-infection)
• 90 ≤ score ≤100: High likelihood of bacterial infection (or co-infection)

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Serum:
To evaluate the precision of the MeMed BV assay for serum samples under the new master
calibration scheme, raw data from the reproducibility study conducted to support previous
clearance of the MeMed BV device (K222332) was re-analyzed.
Repeatability, intermediate precision, and reproducibility were evaluated for each measurand
(TRAIL/IP- 10/CRP) of the MeMed BV Test on the MeMed Key Analyzer using a panel of
specimens collected as part of a clinical study representing either infectious bacteria, infectious
virus, equivocal or noninfectious scores.
The ‘infectious’ specimens were collected from non-U.S. individuals recruited to an infectious
cohort as defined by the MeMed BV test intended use/indications for use under “Artemis” study
protocol. The samples were collected, centrifuged within 1 hour after blood withdrawal,
aliquoted (120 μL) and frozen at -80°C. Prior initiation of the reproducibility study, the aliquots
were sent on dry ice to the participating laboratories. Each aliquot was thawed 10-15 min on a
roller prior to measurement on the MeMed Key instrument.

1CV analysis was not considered for the logistic scale of the MeMed BV Score. The acceptance
criterion for the score was set to be SD < 12.5 score units which reflects a small probability of scores
falling into nonadjacent bins.
An additional study was performed to estimate lot-to-lot variance for each measurand and the
test result for four panel members using serum samples under the new master calibration scheme,
raw data from the lot-to-lot variability study conducted to support clearance of the original
MeMed BV device (K222332) was re-analyzed.

Venous whole blood (WB):
Since, whole Blood (WB) specimens are unstable and prone to hemolysis when undergoing a
freeze-thaw cycle, the evaluation of MeMed BV precision with WB specimens evaluated fresh
samples prepared at a single site and on a single day.
The ‘infectious’ specimens were collected from non-U.S. individuals recruited to an infectious
cohort as defined by the MeMed BV test intended use/indications for use. Each specimen was
analyzed in four runs on five different analyzers (in total 20 repeats) using one cartridge lot. The
study was performed in one laboratory in Israel (MeMed Lab) with a single operator. Calibration
was performed on the first day on each analyzer; one calibrator lot was used.

2. Linearity:
A study was performed to assess the linearity of measurement for each of the three measurands
(TRAIL/IP-10/CRP) in serum and venous whole blood with acceptance criteria for bias due to
non-linearity or less than 15% or 10mg/L for CRP, 15% or 10 pg/mL for TRAIL and 20% or 50
pg/mL for IP-10 of the value corresponding to the linear fit (predicted). The study was performed
in one laboratory with two MeMed Key analyzer (one analyzer per cartridge lot), two lots of
cartridges, one lot of calibration reagents and one lot of External Control reagents. Calibration
was performed before initiating the study for each cartridge lot. External Controls were run daily.
Five replicates of eleven dilutions of each MeMed BV test measurand were measured in the
linearity study. The order of measurement of the dilution series was randomized. The range of
concentrations tested spanned the applicable range for determination of the MeMed BV score
and were 100-2000 pg/mL for IP-10, 15-300 pg/mL for TRAIL, and 1-250 µg/mL for CRP.
Linearity for all MeMed BV measurands fell within the study acceptance criteria for the serum
as well as the venous whole blood sample testing.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interfering substances and cross-reactants were evaluated as part of the prior 510(k) submission
(K222332). Since there is no change in cartridge reagents (antibody or assay formulation), this
study was not repeated.

(K222332). A Hook effect study for venous whole blood specimens evaluated contrived samples
containing high levels of each measurand (at the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ and higher
concentrations) and prepared by spiking protein rich buffer with recombinant proteins. For each
concentration level, three runs were measured on one analyzer on the same day.

No significant loss of signal was observed for the evaluated specimens containing high analyte
concentrations. Therefore, no Hook effect was observed for the MeMed BV test with WB
specimens.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Calibrators
The calibration is a process used to generate the calibration curve and must be repeated every
four weeks and/or when introducing a new test cartridge lot. The calibration curve translates
RLU measurements to concentration of each analyte. A calibration is unique to a device and a
cartridge lot. The calibrators are in effect synthetic samples which can be measured by the device
using the normal cartridge. Each calibrator is a solution of the 3 analytes introduced as
recombinant proteins. Each calibration set includes three vials that represent high, medium, and
low values of the analyte ranges that impact the MeMed BV test score. Calibrators are provided
by MeMed in vials which need to be stored in normal refrigerators (2-8°C). All three analytes are
traceable to a standard. The TRAIL analyte is traced to international biological reference
standard, NIBSC code: 04/166. The CRP analyte is traced to international standard,
IFCC/BCR/CAP CRM 474. The IP-10 analyte is traced to an internal standard prepared by
R&D Systems (Cat. #890836) due to the unavailability of international standards for IP-10. The
material was produced following ISO Guide 34:2009. Value assignment is validated and tested
by a contract manufacturer (MicroCoat) for the quantification of secondary internal standard and
for the quantification of master lot and user calibrators using MeMed Key analyzer.

The quality indicators (i.e., max/min slope, max/min intercept, min slope, and R2) represent
specifications for calibration curves created with released cartridges. These thresholds are
established for each lot of cartridges during manufacturing (based on actual performance of the
produced lot). The data is then encoded to the cartridge barcode, to be read by the analyzer when
running a calibration. Failure to meet these thresholds (during run-time of a calibration) will fail
the calibration. In case of a calibration failure the device will issue a failure message to the user
and will prevent the failed cartridge-lot from running. The device will only run with cartridges
from a lot which has a valid calibration. It is possible to calibrate more than one cartridge lot.
Calibration equivalency study:
Updates to the MeMed BV assay included changes to the assay calibration scheme. A study was
conducted to evaluate correlation between the new calibration scheme (MCC) and the legacy
calibration method. Briefly, one hundred serum specimens with known TRAIL, CRP and IP-10
concentrations were evaluated using both calibration methods on three separate analyzers, 1
repeat per analyzer.

None of the scores for samples evaluated in the study shifted to a non-adjacent reporting bin due
to change in calibration curve scheme. The legacy calibration and the MCC methods can be
considered equivalent methods for producing BV Scores.
Controls
The MeMed BV External controls are intended for quality control testing in clinical laboratories.
The control set includes two control vials containing purified TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP antigens
in a protein buffer. One vial corresponds to a bacterial MeMed BV test score (expected score 90-
100) and one vial corresponds to a viral MeMed BV test score (expected score 0-10). The

software evaluates each control and notifies the user whether the evaluation is completed
successfully.
Reagent Stability
Real-time, in use, and shipping stability of the test cartridge, calibrator and external control were
validated to support the original clearance K210254. Since there is no change to these
components, the stability studies were not repeated.
Specimen Stability
Serum specimen stability and freeze-thaw stability were evaluated under the original clearance
K210254 and was not re-evaluated due to no change in serum specimen processing workflow.
A study was conducted to demonstrate the appropriate handling conditions from venous whole
blood draw to sample input into the cartridge. The study was conducted in one laboratory on four
days, one day per panel member using four WB samples representing two samples with ‘low’
scores and two samples with ‘high’ scores. Two MeMed Key analyzers and one lot of cartridges
were used. Calibration was performed at the beginning of the study using one lot of calibration
reagents. Stability was assessed for each MeMed BV Test measurand (TRAIL/IP-10/CRP) as
well as the MeMed BV Test resulting score.

No significant deviations were observed over the course of the study. These data support
specimen storage for up to 120 mins at room temperature before testing.
6. Detection Limit:
For evaluated specimens with analyte levels below the limit of quantitation, the limit of
quantitation value will be used to generate the MeMed BV score. Therefore, a limit of detection
and a limit of blank was not evaluated.
Limit of Quantitation
To establish equivalence between the new calibration scheme, raw data collected in a previous
LoQ study to support the original clearance of the MeMed BV device (K222332) was re-
analyzed using the new master calibration curve scheme. No significant differences in study
results were observed when relying upon the new calibration scheme.
Additionally, a new study was conducted using two cartridge lots (per each test script) with one
MeMed Key analyzer. Each sample was tested three times on three non-consecutive days.
Because there are no serum or whole blood specimens with residual analyte levels for each of the
three measurands one order of magnitude lower than the analytical range of the measurement
procedure, a protein buffer (calibrator matrix) was employed as the blank samples. Four target
concentrations were prepared as represented in table below.

3 X1.0 of LLOQ 15 100 1
4 X1.1 of LLOQ 16.5 110 1.1
The TE (total error) was calculated for each of the four concentration levels for three analytes as
2 x SD observed (Westgard model with bias=0) with acceptance criteria as TE < 30% for TRAIL
and CRP and TE < 40% for IP-10.

The results show that MeMed BV test passed the acceptance criteria of TE for all samples tested.
For the defined LLOQ concentration levels of TRAIL, CRP, and IP10 (TRAIL 15 pg/mL, CRP 1
mg/L, IP10 100 pg/mL) established in the original clearance (K210254) the results achieved the
following maximal TE values: TRAIL 10%, CRP 10%, and IP10 14%.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay cut-offs remain unchanged from the previously cleared version of the MeMed BV
Device. Please see the published decision summary for K210254 for additional details.
8. Carry-Over:
Carry over for serum specimen was evaluated under the original clearance K210254 and was not
re-evaluated due to no change in serum specimen processing workflow. A study was performed
to evaluate the risk of carry-over between multiple cartridges evaluated on the MeMed Key
instrument for venous whole blood specimen. Specifically, a low score (“L”) and high score
(“H”) clinical specimen were evaluated according to the following sequences:
1) H, H, H, H, H, L, H, L, H, L, H, L, H, L, H
2) L, L, L, L, L, H, L, H, L, H, L, H, L, H, L.
For both sequences evaluated, no significant difference was observed in assay score for either the
high or low clinical specimens. These data support that no carry over occurs in the MeMed Key
instrument with the MeMed BV assay cartridges.
Lead Reviewer or Consulting Reviewer Comments for Internal Discussion Only
The Carry-over study results are acceptable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The equivalency between whole blood and serum sample type for the MeMed BV test was
established by a prospective, multi-center study where matched serum and venous whole blood
specimens were collected from 216 prospectively recruited subjects from 5 medical centers (2 in
the US and 3 in Israel). The study population comprised hospital admitted, emergency
department, and urgent care center patients over the age of 90 days, with clinical suspicion of
acute bacterial or viral infection.

Results from paired sample testing were evaluated with Passing Bablok regression analysis and
the following pre-defined acceptance criteria was applied to the clinically relevant measure of
the test, BV score: a slope in the range of 0.9-1.1 and an intercept in the range of -5 to 5.

Score 216 1.00 [0.99 - 1.00] 0.00 [0.00 - 0.06]
The Passing Bablok regression analysis comparing the BV scores for the tested serum and
venous whole blood specimens yielded a slope of 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.00 and intercept of 0.00,
95% CI 0.00-0.06 which was well within the pre-defined acceptance criteria. Additional
regression analyses of individual measurand values for IP-10 and CRP assay indicated intercept
and slope values, respectively, outside of pre-defined acceptance criteria; however, no systemic
bias was observed in the overall score values which is the clinically relevant test result.
Therefore, the expected clinical impact of the observed bias is expected to be minimal.
Additional analyses were performed to calculate the estimated bias at each cutoff point and the
corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the bias at each point. Results are provided in Table
2 below. Bias was calculated based on regression analysis, with the ratio of error variances set at
λ=1. Confidence bands were computed using bootstrap samples and the accelerated bias
correction (BCa) method.

Further analysis of the study data was conducted to assess the potential impact of sample type on
score assignment to risk bins reported by the MeMed BV test was assessed. The acceptance
criteria were pre-defined as less than 5% of the paired serum and whole blood samples
demonstrating a score deviation that causes a patient to be assigned to a nonadjacent bin.
