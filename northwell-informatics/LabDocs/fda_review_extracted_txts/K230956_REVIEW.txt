A Purpose for Submission:
BD Respiratory Viral Panel (BD RVP)
The purpose of this submission is to demonstrate that the BD Respiratory Viral Panel (SARS-
CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV) for use on the BD MAX System, is substantially
equivalent to the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) (DEN200031) and to obtain clearance
for the BD Respiratory Viral Panel (SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV) Assay.
BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 (BD RVP-SCV2)
The purpose of this submission is to demonstrate that the BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2
(SARS-CoV-2) for use on the BD MAX System, is substantially equivalent to the BioFire
Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) (DEN200031) and to obtain clearance for the BD Respiratory
Viral Panel-SCV2 (SARS-CoV-2) Assay.
B Measurand:
BD Respiratory Viral Panel (BD RVP)
The BD Respiratory Viral Panel detects and identifies nucleic acids from the following
pathogens: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),
Influenza A, Influenza B, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).
For each specimen, the amplification and detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B,
RSV and the internal control, human RNase P, occurs in a single reaction with the use of
multiplexed primers and probes. The multiplexed primers and probes target RNA from the
nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene (N1 and N2 regions) of SARS-CoV-2, matrix (M1) gene of
influenza A, matrix (M1) gene and hemagglutinin (HA) gene of influenza B, N gene and M gene
from RSV and the RNase P gene from the human genome.
A total of eighteen (18) primers are involved in the DNA amplification process and nine (9)
molecular probes are involved in the detection process of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD
MAX System.
BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 (BD RVP-SCV2)
The BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 detects and identifies nucleic acids from the following
pathogens: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 is produced using the same manufacturing processes and
assay reagents as the Respiratory Viral Panel, but requires a different Assay Definition File
(ADF) which, via software-mediated masking, only reports results for the SARS-CoV-2 target.
C Type of Test:
Multiplex nucleic acid assay for use with the BD MAX System for the qualitative detection of
viral pathogens in individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection consistent
with COVID-19, Influenza A, Influenza B, or RSV.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
BD Respiratory Viral Panel (BD RVP) and BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 (BD RVP-
SCV2)
The BD Respiratory Viral Panel (BD RVP) and BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 (BD RVP-
SCV2) along with the BD MAX System comprise an instrument with associated hardware and
accessories, disposable microfluidic cartridges, master mixes, unitized reagent strips, and
extraction reagents. The instrument automates sample preparation including target lysis, Total
Nucleic Acid (TNA) extraction and concentration, reagent rehydration, target nucleic acid
amplification and detection using real-time PCR. The assay includes a Sample Processing
Control (SPC) that is present in the Extraction Tube. The SPC monitors RNA extraction steps,
thermal cycling steps, reagent integrity and the presence of inhibitory substances. The BD MAX
System software automatically interprets test results.
For the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System the analytes reported are SARS-CoV-2,
Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV. For the BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX
System, the analyte is SARS-CoV-2. The difference in analyte(s) reported is determined by an assay
definition file (ADF).
B Principle of Operation:
Test Principle
The BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System and BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2
for BD MAX System assays are designed for use with a nasopharyngeal or anterior nasal swabs
collected in BD Universal Viral Transport System (UVT) or Copan Universal Transport
Media System (UTM). Once collected, the UVT/UTM patient sample is vortexed and 750 ul is
transferred to the BD Molecular RVP Sample Buffer Tube (SBT) provided with the BD
K230956 - Page 4 of 39

--- Page 5 ---
Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System. placed in the BD MAX System. For all sample
types the SBTs are vortexed and then loaded into the BD MAX system along with the
Unitized Reagent Strips, Master Mix, Extraction Tubes, and PCR Cartridges. No further
operator intervention is necessary.
The BD RVP Unitized Reagent Strip contains a combination of lytic and extraction reagents
designed to perform cell lysis and TNA extraction. Nucleic acids released from the target
organisms are captured on magnetic affinity beads. The beads, together with the bound nucleic
acids, are washed and the nucleic acids are eluted by a combination of heat and pH variation.
Eluted TNA is added to neutralization buffer, mixed, and transferred to BD Respiratory Viral
Panel master mix for rehydration. After reconstitution, the BD MAX System dispenses a fixed
volume of RT-PCR-ready solution containing extracted nucleic acids into the PCR Cartridge.
Microvalves on the cartridge are sealed by the system prior to initiating PCR in order to
contain the amplification mixture and thus prevent evaporation and contamination.
The amplified cDNA targets are detected using hydrolysis (TaqMan) probes, labeled at one
end with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore), and at the other end, with a quencher moiety.
Probes labeled with different fluorophores are used to detect the target analytes in different
optical channels of the BD MAX System. When the probes are in their native state, the
fluorescence of the fluorophore is quenched due to its proximity to the quencher. However, in
the presence of target cDNA, the probes hybridize to their complementary sequences and are
hydrolyzed by the 5’–3’ exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase as it synthesizes the
nascent strand along the cDNA template. As a result, the fluorophores are separated from the
quencher molecules and fluorescence is emitted. The amount of fluorescence detected in the
optical channels is directly proportional to the quantity of the corresponding probe that is
hydrolyzed. The BD MAX System monitors these signals at each cycle of the PCR and
interprets the data at the end of the reaction to provide qualitative test results for each analyte.
Identification of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and RNAse P occurs by the use
of target-specific primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that hybridize to conserved regions in
the viral genomes (Table 1).

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Use of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel or the BD Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 requires
either a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) or anterior nasal swab (ANS) to be collected according
to standard procedures and expressed into BD Universal Transport System (UVT) or Copan
Universal Transport Media System (UTM). Note: the BD UVT and the Copan UTM are a
similar device with identical chemical formulations. See Section B. Comparison Studies/Matrix
Comparison.
750 uL of patient sample is transferred to the sample buffer tube (SBT) provided with the BD
Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System kit, which contains 4.5% Triton X-100
Reduced, and placed in the BD MAX sample rack. Unitized Reagent Strips are placed in the
sample rack and securely seated. Foil-sealed dried Extraction Tubes and Master Mix Tubes
are snapped into the appropriate positions on each Unitized Reagent Strip. The sample rack is
placed in the BD MAX instrument along with a BD PCR cartridge. The BD MAX System
automates running of the assay and result reporting.
The BD Respiratory Viral Panel Assay Extraction Tube and Unitized Reagent Strip (URS)
contain a combination of lytic and extraction reagents designed to perform cell lysis and
Total Nucleic Acid (TNA) extraction. 600 μL is transferred from the sample buffer tube into
the URS strip for cell lysis. Following cell lysis, the released nucleic acids are captured by
magnetic affinity beads. The beads with the bound nucleic acids are washed and the TNA is
eluted, and neutralization buffer added. 12.5 μL of eluted TNA is then transferred to BD
Respiratory Viral Panel Master Mix containing RT-polymerase, dNTPs, primers and probes.
This final rehydrated Master Mix is transferred to a BD PCR cartridge for the initiation of
reverse transcriptase PCR mediated conversion of RNA to cDNA and subsequent real-time
PCR.
4. Calibration:
The BD MAX system preventative maintenance is performed twice per year by a BD Field
Service Engineer.
5. Quality Control:
Control Materials
a) External Controls
External Control materials (assay run controls) are not provided as part of the BD
Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System. External Positive and Negative Controls are
not used by the BD MAX System software for the purpose of sample test result
interpretation. External Controls are treated as if they were patient samples. BD recommends
the use of Microbiologics controls (Table 2) which were utilized during assay validation.
Laboratories must establish the number, type and frequency of testing control materials
according to guidelines or requirements of local, provincial, state, federal, and/or country

b) Extraction and Internal Amplification Control
The human RNase P gene is present in all appropriately collected patient samples. It is co-
amplified with SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV gene targets (if present) and
will serve as both an endogenous nucleic acid extraction control and internal amplification
control. In the event that SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, RSV are negative, an
RNase P result must be positive for the SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, RSV results
to be valid negative results. When either SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and/or RSV
target results are positive, RNase P result is ignored. An Unresolved (UNR) result is
indicative of specimen-associated inhibition or reagent failure.

VII Performance Characteristics
A Analytical Performance:
Note: The BD Respiratory Viral Panel – SCV2 for BD MAX System (Panel detects SARS-
CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV) is comprised of the same formulation, composition, and
principle of operation as the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System; however, the BD
Respiratory Viral Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX System utilizes a different Assay Definition File
(ADF), which masks the results for influenza A/B and RSV and only reports the detection of
SARS-CoV-2. As such, the supporting analytical and clinical validation data generated for the
BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System also supports validation of the BD Respiratory
Viral Panel – SCV2 for BD MAX System.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a. Within-Laboratory Precision
Within-laboratory precision was evaluated for the BD Respiratory Viral Panel at one (1) site
with one (1) reagent lot. Testing was performed over twelve (12) days, with two (2) operators
performing two (2) runs per day for a total of forty-eight (48) runs. The viral materials used
to generate the positive panel members were contrived in simulated nasopharyngeal matrix
(See: B. Comparison Studies/Matrix Comparison, below) and included SARS-CoV-2,
Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV. Each panel member was tested in three (3) replicates.
The following target concentrations were used for each target organism contained in each
panel member:
• Moderate positive (MP): 3x LoD
• Low Positive (LP): 2x LoD
• True Negative (TN): No target
The results are shown in Table 5.

a For the True Negative category, the reported agreement indicates percent of negative results.
b. Reproducibility
For the Site-to-Site reproducibility study, three (3) sites (two external and one internal)
were provided the same panels as described above for the Precision study. Each site
performed testing on five (5) distinct days (consecutive or not), wherein each day, one (1)
panel was tested by two (2) technologists. Each panel member was tested in three (3)
replicates.
The qualitative reproducibility is presented below in Table 6 by target analyte. Ct,
internal criterion used to determine a final assay result, was selected as an additional
means of assessing assay reproducibility. Overall mean Ct values with variance
components (SD and %CV) are shown in Table 7.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
a. Wet-Testing
SARS-CoV-2, FluA, FluB, and RSV
This study was performed to determine the analytical reactivity of the BD Respiratory Viral
Panel BD MAX System assay to detect clinically relevant strains, serotypes, or subtypes of
the target species (i.e., SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV). The inclusivity panel was
prepared by spiking various heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 strains and purified cultures of
Flu A/Flu B/RSV virus serotypes/subtypes/strains encompassing temporal and geographical
diversity into negative clinical NP swab VTM/UTM matrix at a concentration of ~3x LoD
and testing in triplicate.
Strains that did not yield 100% reactivity at 3x LoD were prepared at higher concentrations
and tested until the minimum concentration that achieved 100% reactivity was reached. The
strains evaluated and the lowest concentration that achieved 100% reactivity are shown in
Table 10.

a-Positive result for SARS-CoV-2 amplification during the testing of strain A/H1N1(pdm09)/St. Petersburg/61/2015. Curve
analysis shows clear amplification of the influenza A target and RNaseP endogenous control, no amplification of the
influenza B and RSV targets, and weak/delayed amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 target. The curve is suggestive of a viral
titer below the limit of detection for SARS-CoV-2 target.
b-Amplification of targets other than RSV. Curve analysis shows clear amplification of the RNaseP endogenous control and
RSV targets, no amplification of the influenza A or B targets, and weak/delayed amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 target.
No root cause could be identified.
The results from this study demonstrate that the BD Respiratory Viral Panel BD MAX
System is capable of detecting multiple clinically relevant strains of SARS-CoV-2, Flu A,
Flu B, and RSV.
b. In-silico
The inclusivity of the BD MAX System BD Respiratory Viral Panel SARS-CoV-2/Flu
A/B/RSV assay was evaluated using in silico analysis of the forward primers, reverse
primers, and probes for the SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B and RSV target systems in relation
to sequences available in the NCBI GenBank and GISAID gene databases.
Database Retrieval and Alignments of RSV, FluA and FluB Primer/Probe Sets
Sequences were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank nucleotide database for each species. The
sequence coordinates of the RNA design regions were identified using blastn alignments
between a reference sequence and each species dataset. These regions were extracted from all
sequences and subsequently pairwise aligned using R Bioconductor, requiring global
alignments of each oligo against local alignments to the subject. Ambiguous bases were
called as a match when the paired nucleotide matched one of the corresponding bases,
outlined in standard IUPAC code conventions. (Dixon, Bielka, & Cantor, 1986) Primers were
grouped by sets and in the case of RSV, where there are two redundant detection systems;
results were compared across primer-sets to determine overall system capability to detect
each individual isolate.
NCBI accession numbers were used to retrieve associated meta-data from the GenBank files
for each, and the results were used to identify the lineage, type and/or host of each sequenced
isolate when available
Based on in silico analysis of all sequences available as of February 16, 2023 in GISAID
and NCBI databases, the BD MAX System BD Respiratory Viral Panel SARS-CoV-2/Flu
A/B/RSV assay is predicted to detect ≥99.8% Flu A, ~100% for Flu B, and ≥99.4% for
RSV A/B.
Database Retrieval and Alignments of SARS-CoV-2 Primer/Probe Sets
All available full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were retrieved from the EpiCoV
database at https://www.gisaid.org as of February 16, 2023. Sequences meeting internal
quality control criteria (n = 9,330,351), and the nucleocapsid N gene sequence was extracted
by comparison to reference sequence “SARS-CoV- 2/human/USA/WA-CDC-WA1/2020”
(NCBI Accession MN985325). To evaluate the potential impact of sequence variation on the
K230956 - Page 21 of 39

--- Page 22 ---
BD MAX SARS-CoV2 N1 and N2 PCR primer sets, all included sequences were compared
through alignment with the BD MAX SARS-CoV-2 primers and probes.
Based on the in-silico analysis of GISAID and NCBI sequences available up to February 16,
2023 for SARS-CoV-2, the BD MAX System BD Respiratory Viral Panel SARS-CoV-2/Flu
A/B/RSV assay, is predicted to detect ≥99.4% of the sequenced isolates (n = 9,330,351).
Cross-Reactivity/Microbial Interference
a. Exclusivity In-silico Assessment
The aim of this study is to perform an in-silico search for nucleic acid sequences from
species other than the intended targets that match the assay primers and probes. This analysis
serves to identify potential cross reactivity concerns due to primer and probe interactions
with genetic material from species other than the intended targets. The analyses for
primer/probe interactions for SARS-CoV-2, Flu A/B, and RSV were performed separately.
No clinically relevant cross-reactivity was identified for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A,
Influenza B, or RSV.
b. Wet-Testing
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the analytical specificity (cross-
reactivity) and microbial interference of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD
MAX System and BD Respiratory Viral Panel – SCV2 for BD MAX System.
Analytical specificity or cross-reactivity is defined as the ability to generate
negative results for the analytes (SARS-CoV-2, Flu A/B, RSV, and RNase P) in
the presence of viruses, yeasts, fungi, and bacteria that are phylogenetically-
related or likely to be found in respiratory tract clinical specimens, and potential
microbial interference is assessing whether the candidate device can generate
positive results for the analytes in the presence of viruses, yeasts, fungi, and
bacteria that are phylogenetically-related or likely to be found in respiratory tract
clinical specimens. Three (3) replicates in simulated nasopharyngeal matrix (See:
B. Comparison Studies/Matrix Comparison, below) with and without the target
analytes were tested for each potential cross-reactant/ microbial interferent listed
in Table 11 below and must give a negative SARS-Cov-2. Flu A, Flu B, and RSV
result in order to be deemed non-cross-reactive, and a positive SARS-CoV-2, Flu
A, Flu B, and RSV result in order to be deemed non-microbial interferent. No
cross-reactivity or microbial interference was observed at the concentrations
tested.

This study evaluated the performance of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX
System and BD Respiratory Viral Panel – SCV2 for BD MAX System in the presence of
medications, over the counter products, and other potentially interfering substances found in
a clinical respiratory specimen. Assay results were evaluated to determine if the presence of
potentially interfering substances in target analyte negative or target analyte positive samples
had an effect on assay performance. The study utilized simulated nasopharyngeal matrix
containing mucin and human DNA to establish the interference claims (See: B. Comparison
Studies/Matrix Comparison, for validation of equivalency between matrices).
Each interferent was tested with three (3) positive replicates containing SARS-CoV-2,
Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV and three negative replicates containing only the
interferent with the simulated nasopharyngeal matrix for a total of six (6) samples per
interferent level. Three (3) positive replicates containing SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A,
Influenza B, and RSV were run without interferent to demonstrate passing acceptance criteria
for positive samples. Whole blood (Human) at 2% v/v was found to interfere with the assay
of both SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza B. When the amount of blood was titrated downward to
0.2% v/v, it no longer interfered with either assay. Table 12.

Competitive Interference
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the ability of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel
and BD Respiratory Viral Panel – SCV2 for the BD Max system assay to detect the targeted
analytes in cases of simulated mixed infection, when three (3) viral targets are low and one
(1) target is high (competitive interference).
One (1) representative strain of each targeted organism (SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B and
RSV) was tested. Co-infection panels were made by spiking one (1) target organism at high

Traceability
This study was conducted in order to establish the limit of detection (LoD) of the SARS-
CoV-2 target using the WHO international standard [Heat inactivated, England/02/2020,
NIBSC code: 20/146] with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel and BD Respiratory Viral
Panel-SCV2 for BD MAX System. The data generated from this study will be used to
support the conformity of the assay to common specifications in the EU for SARS-CoV-2
assays. The LoD of the WHO international standard was determined in both clinical nasal
matrix and clinical nasopharyngeal matrix.
The LoD confirmation was performed with 20 replicates for each matrix type used, thus
aligning with CLSI 17-A2 Evaluation of the Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory
Measurement Procedures and WHO PQDx_347. The LoD of SARS-CoV-2
[England/02/2020, NIBSC code: 20/146] was determined to be 726 IU/mL. Results are
shown in Table 16.

a) Specimen Stability
Specimen stability studies were performed to support the following stability claims:
Table 17. BD Respiratory Viral Panel Assay for BD MAX System Specimen
Stability
Specimen Stability Temperature Duration
25 ± 2 °C 12 hours
In UVT/UTM
2–8 °C 72 hours
In BD Molecular RVP Sample Buffer 25 ± 2 °C 24 hours
Tube 2–8 °C 120 hours
Freeze/thaw specimen stability studies were performed and indicate that SARS-CoV-2, Influenza
A, Influenza B, and RSV are stable for up to two (2) freeze / thaw cycles in either clinical
nasopharyngeal matrix or clinical nasal matrix expressed in UVT/UTM (neat) or post transfer of
UVT/UTM matrix into sample buffer tubes (nested). Once thawed, samples are stable for up to
12 hours at 25 ± 2 oC. Specimens were constructed using natural clinical nasopharyngeal or
anterior nasal matrix spiked at 3X LoD for each analyte.
b) Reagent Kit Stability
To evaluate reagent kit stability, the reagents were refrigerated at (5±3°C) and stored at “room
temperature” (RT 25 ± 2°C) in parallel. At defined time points during the study, the Master Mix
(MM) and Extraction Tube (Tx) foil pouches are being 1) unsealed, 2) opened, 3) closed and
then, 4) refrigerated and stored at RT in parallel to simulate in-use conditions across the targeted
temperature range of 2-25°C. Reagent tubes are stable for up to 31 days at 2-25 oC after initial
opening and re-sealing of the pouch.
c) Reagent Kit Shipping Stability
The study also assessed reagent kit shipping stability. The purpose is to verify the stability of the
reagents throughout their stored shelf-life at 2-25°C after being exposed to conditions which
could reasonably be encountered during normal shipping conditions. Simulated shipping stability
was performed by subjecting reagents to shipping conditions. This is performed in an
environmental chamber that adjusts both temperature and humidity to mimic shipping
conditions. After shipping exposure, reagents are tested for a post-exposure baseline and
subsequently included in the real-time stability arm of the study.

The purpose of this study was to establish the Limit of Detection (LoD) for SARS-CoV-2 in
clinical nasopharyngeal (NP) and nasal (NS) matrices for the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for
BD MAX System.
LoD studies determine the lowest detectable concentration of virus at which approximately
95% of all (true positive) replicates test positive. LoD was estimated using probit analysis.
Confirmation of the estimated LoD with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA-
WA1/2020) was performed with one (1) reagent lot in replicates of 20 prepared in clinical
nasopharyngeal and clinical nasal matrix. Refer to Table 18 for the BD Respiratory Viral
Panel-SCV2 LoD for SARS-CoV-2 in clinical nasopharyngeal matrix in UVT/UTM. The
LoD for SARS-CoV-2 in NP matrix in UVT/UTM was determined to be 700 copies/mL.

7. Assay Cut-Off
This series of experiments was conducted in order to determine assay thresholds for
the SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV target assays by utilizing both contrived
positive and negative nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and simulated nasopharyngeal
(SIM) specimens in UVT/UTM. NP specimens were representative for both NPS and
anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimen types as NPS specimens are considered worst
case. NPS specimens provide the most amount of background material while simulated
matrix represents a specimen with the least amount of background material. Specimens
were tested over six (6) master mix (MM) reagent lots across fifteen (15) instruments
over three (3) test days.

The assay cut-off for the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX was established
based on PCR-based metrics taken together by the BD MAX software algorithm to
make the qualitative decision whether a curve is to be considered positive or negative.
These metrics (e.g., Ct, RFU endpoints, signal-to-noise ratios) are initially set by
default parameters defined by the instrument. As the product undergoes product
development, the data are supplemented, and the algorithm is adjusted (“trained”)
using viral cultures spiked into clinical background matrices at levels surrounding the
limit of detection and expected clinical range.

9. Carry-Over:
Carryover / Cross-Contamination
This study was conducted to investigate within-run and between-run carryover while
processing samples with high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in the BD Respiratory Viral Panel
for BD MAX System. High positive samples contained heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 spiked
into pooled nasal swab matrix at a concentration of ≥1.94E+07 copies/mL. The negative
samples consisted of simulated nasopharyngeal (NP) matrix without any target analyte.
Twelve (12) replicates of the high positive panel member and 12 replicates of the negative
panel member were tested in nine (9) runs by alternating negative and positive samples,
using three BD MAX Systems. A total of 108 positive and 108 negative samples were
tested. Of the 108 negative samples tested, one (1) false positive result was obtained (0.93%,
95% CI: 0.16–5.06%).

tested with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System at four (4) U.S. testing
sites.
The BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2
performance by comparing the candidate device testing results to a composite comparator
algorithm (CCA) consisting of three (3) highly sensitive U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2
molecular tests. A final CCA result was assigned when two of the three composite
comparator assays were in concordance. The comparator method utilized to establish
performance for the Flu A, Flu B, and RSV targets was a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular Flu
A/B/RSV assay. All comparator testing was performed in accordance with the respective
package inserts.
The BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System was evaluated with both Category I
specimens (i.e., prospectively collected, tested fresh) and Category II specimens (i.e.,
prospectively collected, tested frozen/thawed).
A total of 2005 paired NPS and ANS specimens were enrolled for the prospective clinical
study between January 2022 and August 2022. Category I specimens were collected from
April 2022 to August 2022, while Category II specimens were collected from January 2022 to
April 2022.
Of these 2005 subjects, 360 were excluded as non-compliant (protocol deviations, etc.). This
left a total of 1645 Compliant Subjects. A demographic summary of the compliant subjects is
shown in Table 23.
For the SARS-CoV-2 evaluation, an additional 100 NP specimens were excluded (protocol
deviations, etc.) leaving 1545 NPS specimens for performance evaluation. Similarly, an
additional 84 NS specimens were excluded (protocol deviations, etc.) leaving 1561 ANS
specimens for evaluation.
Of the 1545 valid NPS specimens, 1021 (66.1%) were tested fresh (Category I specimens)
and 524 (33.9%) were tested frozen/thawed (Category II specimens) with the BD Respiratory
Viral Panel for BD MAX System. Of the 1561 valid ANS specimens, 1021 (65.4%) were
tested fresh and 540 (34.6%) were tested frozen/thawed with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel
for BD MAX System.
For the Flu A, Flu B, and RSV evaluations, an additional 83 NS specimens were excluded
(protocol deviations, etc.) leaving a total of 1562 NPS specimens. For the NS specimens, an
additional 81 specimens were excluded (protocol deviations, etc.) leaving 1564 ANS
specimens for evaluation.
Of the 1562 valid NPS specimens, 1022 (65.4%) were tested fresh and 540 (34.6%) were
tested frozen/thawed with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX. Of the 1564 valid
NS specimens, 1025 (65.5%) were tested fresh and 539 (34.5%) were tested frozen/thawed
with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System.

A summary of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System assay prospective
clinical study performance is provided in Tables 24 & 25. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA)
was calculated as 100% × (TP / (TP + FN)). True positive (TP) indicates that both the BD
Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System assay and the comparator method had a
positive result for the specific analyte, and false negative (FN) indicates that the BD
Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System was negative while the comparator result was
positive. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was calculated as 100% × (TN / (TN + FP)).
True negative (TN) indicates that both the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System
assay and the comparator method had negative results, and false positive (FP) indicates that
the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System assay was positive while the
comparator result was negative.

Co-infections Detected by the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX Assay in the
Prospectively Collected Specimens
The BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System detected a total of 4 of the 5 co-
infections (3 ANS, 1 NP) in which SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A were detected by the
comparators. Only Flu A was detected by the candidate in the remaining sample (ANS).
The candidate assay detected 2 additional samples with SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A co-infections
(1 ANS, 1 NP) and 1 additional sample with SARS-CoV-2 and Flu B co-infection (NP).
However, the comparators detected only SARS-CoV-2 in all three samples.
Retrospective Clinical Study
Flu B and RSV were of low prevalence and were not encountered in sufficiently large
numbers during the prospective clinical study to adequately demonstrate assay performance.
To supplement the results of the prospective clinical study, an evaluation of 20 RSV standard
of care (SoC) positive and 14 Flu B SoC positive Category III ANS specimens was
undertaken. These specimens, in addition to negative specimens collected under a BD
collection protocol, in UVT/UTM, were collected between February 2021 and February 2023

provided by the source laboratory, that were not confirmed as positive by the comparator, are
included in the total N=187. They were counted as part of the Negative Percent Agreement
(NPA). One (1) specimen generated an Unresolved (UNR) assay result for both Flu B and
RSV and was excluded from the performance analysis. A summary of the demographic
information of the retrospective ANS samples is provided in Table 28.

1One specimen generated an Unresolved (UNR) assay result for both Flu B and RSV. An UNR is generated
when the target result and the Sample Processing Control (SPC) are both negative and no instrument error was
recorded.
In addition, clinical performance characteristics of the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD
MAX System were also assessed from a total of 240 frozen retrospective nasopharyngeal swabs
(NPS) in UVT/UTM obtained from two (2) external sources with historical positive or negative
results for either influenza B or RSV. The specimens were collected as part of routine patient
care between December 2019 and January 2022. All the specimens were tested in a blinded and
randomized fashion with the BD Respiratory Viral Panel for BD MAX System at least three
different testing sites and FDA-cleared high sensitivity RT- PCR assay as comparator at one
reference testing site. Table 30 summarizes the demographic information (gender and age
group) by percentage for compliant subjects for retrospective NPS specimens.

The BD MAX RVP SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay prospective clinical study included a
total of 1562 prospectively collected NPS specimens and 1566 prospectively collected ANS
specimens. The stratification of positivity rates by analyte (as determined by the BD MAX RVP
SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV test) and location for the prospective samples is shown in Table 32.
Sample collection was carried out at 8 geographic locations. For the CTMD site, the same
principal investigator had oversight of three clinics (two (2) in Florida and one (1) in North
Carolina). Data from those three (3) clinics were aggregated.
