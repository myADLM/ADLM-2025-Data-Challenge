laboratories and provides a rapid analytical screening procedure to detect 6-Acetylmorphine in
human urine. The assay is designed for use with a number of clinical chemistry analyzers. This
product is intended to be used by trained professionals only.
The semi-quantitative mode is for the purpose of enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate
dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as Liquid
Chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish
quality control procedures. The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more
specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.
Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly
when preliminary results are used. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
B Indication(s) for Use:
See Intended use above
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Performance characteristics studies were conducted on the Horiba Yumizen C1200 clinical
chemistry analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
CEDIATM Heroin Metabolite (6-AM) assay is supplied as a two liquid (1 and 2) and two
lyophilized reagents (1a and 2a) kit that is available in a kit configuration.
1. EA Reconstitution Buffer: Contains 0.32 mg/L mouse monoclonal antibodies to 6-
Acetylmorphine, buffer salts, stabilizer, detergent and preservative
1a. EA Reagent: Contains 0.171 g/L Enzyme Acceptor, buffer salts, detergent and preservative
2. ED Reconstitution Buffer: Contains buffer salts, stabilizer, and preservative
2a. ED Reagent: Contains 16.2 μg/L Enzyme Donor conjugated to 6- Acetylmorphine, 1.67 g/L
chlorophenol red-β-D galactopyranoside, stabilizer, detergent, preservative.
B Principle of Operation: CEDIA technology uses recombinant DNA technology to produce a
unique homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based on the bacterial enzyme
β-galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two inactive fragments. These
K231007 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
fragments spontaneously re-associate to form fully active enzymes that, in the assay format, cleave
a substrate. This generates a color change that can be measured spectrophotometrically.
In the CEDIATM Heroin Metabolite (6-AM), the analyte in the sample competes with 6-AM
conjugated to Enzyme Donor (ED) for antibody binding sites. If 6-AM is present in the sample, it
binds to antibody, leaving the ED-6-AM conjugate free to re-associate with Enzyme Acceptor
(EA) to form active β-galactosidase. If no 6-AM is present in the sample, antibody binds to the
ED-6-AM conjugate, inhibiting the re-association of inactive - galactosidase fragments, and thus
reducing the amount of active enzyme formed. The amount of active enzyme formed, and resultant
absorbance change are proportional to the amount of 6-AM present in the sample.

Approved Guideline – Third Edition.
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
All analytical performance studies were conducted on the Horiba Yumizen C1200 clinical
chemistry analyzer.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed based upon recommendations in CLSI Guideline EP05-A3, at
one site with one analyzer and two lots of reagents. Testing was carried out for 20 days with two
runs per day, at least two hours apart and two replicates per run in both qualitative and semi-
quantitative modes, giving a total of 80 determinants (n = 80). Drug-free negative urine was spiked
with 6- Acetylmorphine analyte to final concentrations of -100%, -75%, -50%, -25%, below cutoff,
cutoff, and +25%, +50%, +75% and +100%, above cutoff, and the concentrations were confirmed
by LC-MS/MS or GC/MS.
For qualitative and semi-quantitative mode results from a representative lot are summarized in the
tables below.

2. Linearity:
To demonstrate linearity of the assay throughout the calibration range of 0 to 20 ng/mL, a drug
free–urine pool spiked with 6-AM at 20 ng/mL was serially diluted with drug free urine to generate
ten intermediate levels. Each sample was run in replicates of five in semi-quantitative mode and
the average was used to determine percent recovery compared to the expected target value.
The observed result (y) and the target expected result (x) were compared using the least squares
regression method. The regression equation and correlation obtained are:
y = 0.9008x + 0.3445; R² = 0.997
The recovery of the samples from the linear range of the assay (2 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) prepared
by dilution ranged from 90.5% to 111.0%.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
A. Cross-reactivity (specificity) of the structurally related and unrelated compounds with the
performance of the candidate device was evaluated by adding known amounts of each compound
to drug-free negative urine. The samples were tested in duplicate with the candidate device in both
the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Percent cross-reactivity was calculated as follows:
% Cross-reactivity = (Cutoff concentration / Lowest concentration of cross reactant that gives a
positive result) x 100

controls. Structurally unrelated compounds were evaluated by adding each substance to 6-
Acetylmorphine spiked at low (7.5 ng/mL) and high (12.5 ng/mL) controls at the concentrations
indicated. As shown in the tables below, all the pharmacologic compounds evaluated exhibited no
cross-reactivity at the concentrations tested.
• Samples were tested in replications of five (n=5) in both qualitative and semiquantitative modes.

Effect of pH: Drug free urine spiked with 7.5 or 12.5 ng/mL of 6-Acetylmorphine was adjusted
to the indicated pH (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11). Samples were tested in replicates of five (n=5)
in both qualitative and semiquantitative modes. The results demonstrated that the tested range of
pH did not affect the performance of the candidate test.
Effect of Specific Gravity:
Urine that spanned a specific gravity range of 1.000–1.030 were spiked with 7.5 or 12.5 ng/mL of
6-Acetylmorphine (6-AM). Samples were tested in replicates of five (n=5) in both qualitative and
semiquantitative modes. The results demonstrated that the specific gravity range evaluated did not
affect the performance of the candidate test.

Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The device is traceable to a commercially available standard that was verified by LC/MS-MS
or GC/MS.

B Comparison Studies:
Method Comparison with Predicate Device: A Method comparison study was performed using
one hundred and twenty-three unaltered clinical samples analyzed using the candidate test in one
replicate, in both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. The results were compared to LC-
