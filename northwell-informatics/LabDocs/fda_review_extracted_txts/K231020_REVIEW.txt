A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Alinity c Tricyclic Antidepressants Reagent Kit is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay
intended for use in the qualitative and/or semiquantitative determination of the presence of
tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in human serum or plasma at a cutoff concentration of 300
ng/mL on the Alinity c system in patients suspected of drug overdose.
The semiquantitative mode is for the purpose of enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by confirmatory method such as Liquid
Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), or for permitting laboratories to
establish control procedures.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Liquid Chromatography/Tandem
Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method.
Clinical and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly
when preliminary positive results are used.
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Abbott Laboratories Alinity c System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Alinity c Tricyclic Antidepressants Reagent Kit is an enzyme immunoassay using the
following ready-to-use liquid reagents.
The Alinity c Tricyclic Antidepressants Reagent Kit is supplied as a two liquid
reagent kit (R1 and R2). They are included within the same kit, as follows:
• Antibody/Substrate Reagent (R1): Contains polyclonal anti-tricyclics antibodies (sheep),
glucose-6- phosphate (G6P), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in Tris buffer
with sodium azide as a preservative.
• Enzyme Conjugate Reagent (R2): Contains glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PDH) labeled with nortriptyline in Tris buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.
K231020 - Page 2 of 16

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The assay is based on the competition between an enzyme-labeled drug and the drug from the
serum or plasma for a fixed number of specific antibody binding sites. In the absence of drug
from the sample, the specific antibody binds to the drug labeled with glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and the enzyme activity is inhibited. This phenomenon creates a direct
relationship between the drug concentration in the serum or plasma and the enzyme activity. The
G6PDH enzyme activity is determined spectrophotometrically at 340/416 nm by measuring its
ability to convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.

Linearity
A linearity study was performed in which drug-free serum was spiked with nortriptyline at
the concentration of the high calibrator and then diluted with drug-free serum to generate 9
intermediate levels.
Five (5) replicates of each sample using one (1) lot of reagent, calibrator, and control were
run in semi-quantitative mode and the average was used to determine percent recovery
compared to the expected target value. The results are presented in the table below:
Linearity - Semi-quantitative mode

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Specificity (Cross-Reactivity)
A specificity (cross-reactivity) study was performed using one lot of reagents, calibrators,
and controls.
Test samples were prepared by spiking the potentially cross-reacting compounds at the
concentrations in the table below into drug-free serum. The test samples were run in
duplicate on one analyzer in the semi-quantitative mode. The cross-reactivity was then
calculated from the semi-quantitative result.
The results are summarized in the tables below.

None of the compounds in the table above caused positive or negative interference at the
concentrations tested.
*The sponsor performed additional testing and determined that Carbamazepine
concentrations of 4000 ng/mL and higher caused positive results at a TCA concentration of
253 ng/mL (approximately 25% below the cutoff concentration of 300 ng/mL).
The sponsor also provided documentation from the literature supporting that Carbamazepine
in the presence of TCA will cause a falsely elevated TCA result with some immunoassays.
This limitation is included in the sponsor’s labeling.
The sponsor also performed a study to evaluate potential positive or negative interference
with the candidate assay from common endogenous and exogenous substances. Potentially
interfering substances were spiked into the low control, 225ng/mL (-25% of the cutoff
concentration of 300 ng/mL) and high control, 375 ng/mL (+25% of the cutoff concentration
of 300 ng/mL).
No positive or negative interference was seen in the presence of the compounds listed in the
table below:

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay reportable range for neat samples extends to 500 ng/mL and higher concentrations
will be reported as >500 ng/mL. If a semi-quantitative value greater than 500 ng/mL is
required, a 1:5 or 1:10 manual dilution may be performed, as specified in the labeling. The
sponsor providing the results of a manual dilution study demonstrating that accurate results
could be obtained with 1:5 and 1:10 dilutions.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability: The assay is traceable to the certified reference material (nortriptyline
purchased from a commercial source).
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration is described in the precision section, VII.A.1. above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The sponsor evaluated 50 negative and 50 positive samples in both qualitative and semi-
quantitative modes by comparing the results to LC- MS/MS (Liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectroscopy). The testing was performed using one lot of reagents, one lot of
calibrators, and one lot of controls.

*these samples detected positive by immunoassay contained Carbamazepine at
concentrations of 4275 ng/mL and 5285 ng/mL, respectively. Carbamazepine has been
shown to interfere with this immunoassay at these concentrations.
2. Matrix Comparison:
The sponsor performed a study in which patient samples were run in both qualitative and
semi-quantitative modes in accordance with CLSI Guidelines EP12-A2, EP35 and EP39.
For comparison between serum, K EDTA, K EDTA, and lithium heparin samples, 50
2 3
matched samples with concentrations covering the measuring range were analyzed. For the
comparison between serum and sodium heparin, a different set of 50 matched samples with
concentrations covering the measuring range were analyzed. The study demonstrated that
nortriptyline concentrations obtained in different test plasma matrices with different
anticoagulants are equivalent to those measured in the primary or control matrix (serum)
across the assay’s measuring range. Results are presented in the table below.
