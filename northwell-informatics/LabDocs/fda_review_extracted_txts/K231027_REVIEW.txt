B Principle of Operation:
KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans consists of modified Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented
with bovine serum albumin, cysteine, glutamic acid, sucrose and HEPES. The HEPES buffer
protects against pH changes. Phenol red is used as a pH indicator. Sucrose aids in the
preservation of organism viability. To minimize the contamination of commensal organisms,
Vancomycin, Econazole Nitrate, and Polymyxin B are incorporated into the medium formula.
Specimens need to be placed into the tube containing transport medium immediately after
sample collection and submitted to the laboratory as soon as possible. It is recommended that 2-
8°C is the most appropriate temperature for specimen transportation.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Shelf-life Stability:
The shelf life for the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media was determined to be 12 months
from the date of manufacture when stored at temperature 2-8oC and 20-25oC. The shelf-life
of the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media was established using real-time aging
performance test at time points T= 0, 6, 9, 11, and 12 months. Three lots each of the KaiBiLi
Extended ViralTrans media in the 1 mL and 3 mL configurations (a total of 6 lots) were
evaluated for appearance, net volume, pH value, bacteriostasis, and sterility at each time
point in the real-time aging performance test.
a. Shelf-life, Appearance, Bacteriostasis, Net volume, and pH value:
The shelf-life stability was conducted by visual inspection with the following criteria:
the media should be a clear transparent pink liquid; the media should have no
turbidity, sediment, or color change. All lots tested at each time point passed the
criteria for appearance.
The bacteriostasis ability of the transport media was evaluated by measuring for
growth of microorganisms, spiked into the transport media, after 48 hours at 37oC. No
microorganism growth was observed and all lots tested at each time point passed the
criteria for bacteriostasis.
Net volume stability was evaluated by measuring the volume of the transport media.
The net volume should not fall outside the range of 2.7-3.3 mL for the 3 mL media
configuration or 0.9-1.1 mL for the 1 mL media configuration. All lots tested at each
time point passed the criteria for net volume.
The pH stability of the transport media was determined by measuring the pH of the
transport media. The pH value for each transport media at each time point should be
within the pH range of 7.1-7.5. For all tubes at each time point, the pH value was
within the predefined pH range and had an average of 7.22 ± 0.2.
b. Sterility:
The KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans tube and media are not sold as sterile nor are they
intended to be sterilized by the user. These vials are single use devices. To minimize
contamination, the tubes are filled aseptically under control conditions. The swabs
provided with the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media are individually packaged and
are sold as sterile.
The results for appearance, net volume, and pH value collectively support the claim for 12
months of storage for the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media at 2-8oC and 20-25oC.
6. Detection Limit:
Performance Testing- Recovery Studies:
K231027 - Page 6 of 10

--- Page 7 ---
Performance of the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media was evaluated using culture-based
recovery studies for viruses and bacteria at different incubation times and temperatures.
For Recovery Studies, virus titer (TCID /mL) was quantified to evaluate the recovery of the
50
following viruses in the corresponding matrices listed in Table 1 below: Herpes Simplex
Virus Type 1 (ATCC VR-733; HSV-1), Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (ATCC VR-734;
HSV-2), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (ATCC VR-26; RSV), Cytomegalovirus (ATCC VR-
977), Adenovirus (ATCC VR-3), Parainfluenza 3 (ATCC VR-93), Influenza A (ATCC VR-
822; Flu A), and Varicella Zoster Virus (ATCC VR-1832; VZV). Recovery of
Chlamydophila pneumoniae (ATCC VR-2282) was evaluated using Fluorescent Foci Count
method (IFU/mL). Recovery of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (ATCC 15531) and Ureaplasma
urealyticum (ATCC 27618) was evaluated using the Swab Elution and Roll Plate methods
(CFU/mL). Performance evaluation was carried out in three lots of media that represent
newly manufactured, middle-aged, and recently expired media. Negative clinical matrix
pools were contrived from a minimum of five donors. Matrix pools were determined to be
negative prior to use in the specimen stability recovery studies.

25oC for 0, 24, and 48 hours. At each incubation time point, the sample was vortexed and a
200µL aliquot was removed for the recovery study. The recovery study was conducted using
suitable host cells and tissue culture media. For tissue culture, host cells were plated in a
microwell plate and allowed to adhere for 48-72 hours prior to recovery testing. Hep-2 cells
were used for HSV-1, RSV, and C. pneumoniae; Vero cells were used for HSV-2; MRC-5
cells were used for Cytomegalovirus and VZV; A549 cells were used for Adenovirus; LLC-
MK2 cells were used for Parainfluenza 3; MDCK cells were used for Flu A.
Bacterial stocks were diluted into four different dilutions into the corresponding pooled
negative clinical matrix and 100 µL of each dilution was transferred onto a dry sterile swab
and placed into the KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media tubes in duplicate and stored at 2-
8oC and 20-25oC for 0, 24, and 48 hours. For the swab elution method, at each incubation
time point, each sample was vortexed, serially diluted and a 100µL aliquot was removed for
the recovery study. The recovery study was conducted using Mycoplasma pneumoniae
culture medium for M. pneumoniae and Ureaplasma urealyticum culture medium for U.
urealyticum. For the roll-plate method, a single dilution was tested in triplicate by streaking
the swab from the various KaiBiLi Extended ViralTrans media tube incubation time point
over the agar media specified above and incubating for CFU enumeration.
Viral titer for the viruses and foci counts for C. pneumoniae were evaluated, and CFU was
enumerated for M. pneumoniae and U. urealyticum. The average recovery was calculated as
mean viral titer (TCID /mL), mean foci count (IFU/mL), or mean CFU/mL, respectively, for
50
each storage temperature and time points. The changes (any increase or decrease) in the
recovery between time points (each time point compared to time point 0) were presented in
percent values or log change (negative for decrease and positive for increase). Any change
10
that was within one log difference (+/-90%) was considered acceptable. Results were
combined for all the lots, irrespective of age, as all changes were acceptable. The results are
presented in Tables 2 and 3 below.
