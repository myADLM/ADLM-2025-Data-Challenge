The ACL TOP Family 70 Series (ACL TOP 370, ACL TOP 570 and ACL TOP 770 / 770s / 770
LAS) are bench top, fully automated, random access analyzers designed specifically for in vitro
diagnostic clinical use by health care professionals in the hemostasis laboratory for coagulation
and/or fibrinolysis testing in the assessment of thrombosis and/or hemostasis. The systems
provide results for both direct hemostasis measurements and calculated parameters.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ACL TOP Family 70 Series are fully automated coagulation analyzers that utilize the same
intuitive software, the same consumables, reagents, calibrators and controls, and provide the
same analytical methodology for routine and specialty assay result reporting as the predicate
ACL TOP Family 50 Series.
The ACL TOP Family 70 Series instrument performs the following types of tests, using the same
optical measuring wavelengths and test parameters as the predicate ACL TOP Family 50 Series:
• Coagulometric (Turbidimetric) Measurements
• Chromogenic (Absorbance) Measurements
• Immunological Measurements
The ACL TOP Family 70 Series also offers the same pre‐analytical features available on the
ACL TOP Family 50 Series. These features alert the instrument operator to a potential HIL
(Hemoglobin, Icteric and Lipemia) interference situation specific to the assays requested for a
sample, underfilled sample tubes or a detected clog.
B Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
ACL TOP Family 70 Series (ACL TOP 370, ACL TOP 570, ACL TOP 770, ACL TOP 770s,
ACL TOP 770 LAS)
2. Specimen Identification:
Samples, reagents, and diluents are identified by a barcode reader.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Draw blood into a light blue top tube containing 3.2% sodium citrate. Using other
anticoagulants may cause invalid results. Fill to the proper level, indicated by a fill line on
the tube. Gently invert six times to mix. Process immediately.
4. Calibration:
The ACL TOP instrument makes dilutions, adds reagents, and takes readings, then generates
a calibration curve. The instrument can store the ten most recent calibrations. However, only
one calibration can be validated at any time.
K231031 - Page 2 of 14

5. Quality Control:
The ACL TOP instrument provides a Quality Control (QC) program that allows user to
monitor performance characteristics of an analytical system for precision and accuracy as
well as alert user to sources of unacceptable analytical performance.

Fibrinogen Precision Study
Precision testing was performed for fibrinogen with one reagent lot of HemosIL
RecombiPlasTin 2G using representative ACL TOP Family 70 Series models (ACL TOP
370, ACL TOP 570, and ACL TOP 770). For each material, testing was executed for 20 days
at two runs per day, 2 replicates per run (n=80) per material per instrument model. Two
control levels, as well as two sample pools, were tested. All acceptance criteria for
repeatability and within-laboratory precision were met.

Method Comparison Studies
D-Dimer Method Comparison
A method comparison study for D-Dimer was performed with one lot of HemosIL D-Dimer
HS 500 to compare the performance on representative ACL TOP Family 70 Series models
(ACL TOP 370, ACL TOP 570, and ACL TOP 770) to a representative ACL TOP Family 50
Series model (ACL TOP 750 CTS). The study included 138 native clinical patient samples,
spanning the assay’s analytical measuring range (AMR) to demonstrate equivalent
performance between the subject device and predicate device. The first replicate result on the
candidate device (ACL TOP Family 70 Series models) was compared to the duplicate mean on
the predicate device (ACL TOP Family 50 Series).

Factor VIII Method Comparison Study
A method comparison study for factor VIII was performed with one lot of HemosIL Factor
VIII deficient plasma (run with HemosIL SynthASil) to compare the performance on
representative ACL TOP Family 70 Series models (ACL TOP 370, ACL TOP 570, and ACL
TOP 770) to a representative ACL TOP Family 50 Series model (ACL TOP 750 CTS). The
first replicate result on the candidate device (ACL TOP Family 70 Series models) was
compared to the duplicate mean on the predicate device (ACL TOP Family 50 Series). The
study included 148 samples spanning the assay’s AMR to demonstrate the equivalent
performance between the subject and predicate devices.
