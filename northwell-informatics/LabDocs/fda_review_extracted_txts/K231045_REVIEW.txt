C Type of Test:
Qualitative and semi-quantitative urinalysis
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Healgen URS Test Strips are for the qualitative detection of Leukocytes (white blood cells)
and nitrite in urine as an aid in the screening of a Urinary Tract infection (UTI). It is intended for
over-the-counter home use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Healgen URS Test Strips are an in vitro diagnostic device that use reagents for qualitative
detection of leukocyte and nitrite in urine.
The device is composed of two-color pads aligned on a strip. One pad is employed for testing
leukocyte and the other for nitrite by visually reading the color change of the pad and comparing
with the corresponding blocks on a color chart.
B Principle of Operation:
The Healgen URS Test Strips measure the color developed in 2 reaction zones (leukocytes and
nitrite pads) on the test strips following application of a urine sample. The developed colors are
then compared to calibration colors located on the Healgen color chart card and the result for
each pad is determined based on the minimum color distance between the developed colors and
calibration colors.
The leukocytes test uses the hydrolysis of an indoxyl ester derivative through the action of
leukocyte esterase. The liberated indoxyl ester reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a colored
compound (pink to purple).
K231045 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
The nitrite test uses the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of p-arsanilic acid to form a
diazonium compound in an acid medium. This compound then couples with 1, 2, 3, 4-
tetrahydrobenzo (h) quinoline to produce a pink color.

High glucose levels (≥1000 mg/dL) and high ascorbic acid (≥150 mg/dL) may decrease
leukocyte readings. High ascorbic acid (≥150 mg/dL) may cause a false negative nitrite
reading.
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples with specific
gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.035 and urine samples with pH ranging from pH of 5 to 9
were tested at different leukocyte and nitrite concentrations. The test results show that pH
>8.0 may cause false positive leukocyte readings, and specific gravity ≥1.035 may cause
false negative leukocyte readings. There is no effect of both pH and specific gravity on nitrite
testing.
To address the observed interference, the labeling indicates that dehydration (high specific
gravity), high glucose, and high vitamin C (ascorbic acid) may interfere with results. The
labeling also describes that urine with abnormal color (e.g., bright yellow or green) should
not be tested.
Sample Carryover
A sample carryover study was performed. Three (3) lots of test strips were used for testing.
The study was performed by dipping the test strip into the sample and holding the test strip
vertically upward or downward for 10 seconds to allow the sample flow from one pad to the
other pad (e.g., run-over for the leucocyte pad to the nitrite pad with a sample with a high
concentration of leukocyte and a normal concentration of nitrite and runover for the nitrite to
the leukocyte pad with a sample with a high concentration of nitrite and a normal
concentration of leukocyte). Testing was also repeated in the other direction. The study
demonstrated that carryover (run-over) does not impact the test results.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The results of the analytical studies support the following measurement ranges:
Analyte Measurement range
qualitative: Negative, Trace, +, ++, +++
Leukocytes
semi-quantitative: Negative, 15, 70, 125, 500 (cells/µL)
Nitrite qualitative: Negative, Positive
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The nitrite test is traceable to NIST SRM 8040 and the leukocyte pad is traceable to a
commercially available solution.
Stability
The sponsor provided information to support that the device is stable for 24 months when
stored at 2-30 ℃ based on real-time stability studies. The package insert recommends that
users store the strips at 15-30°C (59-86°F).

The sponsor instructs the user to use the test strip immediately after the foil pouch is opened
based on the results of the open-pouch stability study that demonstrated an open-pouch
stability of 1 hour.
6. Detection Limit:
See Assay cutoff section below.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
A sensitivity study was performed to evaluate the lower limits of detection for each analyte
on the URS Test Strips. Urine samples were spiked to known concentrations of each analyte.
These samples were then diluted to the lowest positive concentrations that are indicated on
the color chart. Each sample was tested in duplicate (2) with three (3) device lots by five (5)
different operators. The sponsor defined the LOD as the concentration of analyte that
produces positive URS Test Strip results approximately 50% of the time. The results support
the claim that the sensitivity of the leukocyte test is 15 cells/µL and the sensitivity of the
nitrite test is 0.05 mg/dL.

The sponsor provided studies to support the recommended wetting time (1-2 seconds) and
the recommended reading time (2 minutes).
B Comparison Studies:
1. Lay User study:
Three (3) sites were selected to perform the lay-user studies. One hundred fifty (150) lay
users with UTI symptoms were recruited to test their own urine sample using the Healgen
URS Test Strips. Laypersons performed one test with the Healgen URS Test Strips according
to the product insert and then collected a sample of their urine for comparison testing by
