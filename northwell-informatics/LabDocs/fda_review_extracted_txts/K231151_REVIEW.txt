*LoQ: Limit of Quantification
B Principle of Operation:
The Kenota 1 Total IgE is a lateral flow immunoassay test system that measures total IgE in
human capillary whole blood on the Kenota 1 instrument. After an operator loads the fingerstick
(FS) sample into the Kenota 1, the instrument dispenses a set amount of the fingerstick sample
(4.5 µL) onto the Kenota 1 Total IgE Cartridge and adds the Kenota 1 Developing Solution to
allow the sample to flow along the membrane to the test line containing immobilized mouse anti-
human IgE that captures the human IgE in the test sample. This immune complex is captured by
mouse anti-(human IgE) IgG bound to the fluorescent reporter. The fluorescent test signal is
directly proportional to the level of IgE in the sample. Excess fluorescent reporter conjugates are
captured at the control line, which consists of immobilized rat anti-mouse kappa light chain IgG.
The Kenota 1 instrument provides a printout of the patient result upon completion of each
sample analysis. The operator presents this report to the allergist.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Kenota 1
2. Specimen Identification:
Kenota 1 instrument automatically prompts the user to enter the appropriate patient and test
request information.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Kenota 1 processes fresh fingerstick whole blood samples collected in a blood collector
coated with lithium heparin anticoagulant (Minivette POCT lithium-heparin green plunger

(100 µL, Sarstedt) and transferred to the syringe assembly of the Kenota 1 sample collection
kit (SCK) for the Kenota 1 Total IgE. The syringe assembly is manually loaded into the
Kenota 1 by the operator.
4. Calibration:
There is no calibration required to be performed by the end user. Calibration is performed by
Kenota, and each lot of cartridges are calibrated by Kenota staff at the manufacturer’s site.
The calibration of the Kenota 1 Total IgE is directly traceable to the 3rd International
Standard for serum IgE (11/234) from the World Health Organization (WHO), using a set of
nine working calibrators with values assigned to 0, 2.17, 6.2, 18.6, 37.2, 93, 310, 620, and
930 kU/L.
5. Quality Control:
Performance of the Kenota 1 Total IgE is verified with the Kenota 1 Total IgE External
Controls. The external controls are stabilized control material used for verifying the
performance of the Kenota 1 Total IgE and intended users’ operational procedures. Results of
the external control sessions are not interpreted by the operator but by the Kenota 1
instrument. If both controls fail, the Kenota 1 is automatically locked out and the operator is
instructed to contact Kenota Support. The external controls are required to be run when a
new lot of Kenota 1 Total IgE cartridge is used, or a new operator is qualified, or when a
monthly (every 30 days) maintenance session is performed.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Kenota 1 Total IgE was evaluated according to CLSI document EP05-A3
and included four studies: (a) Variability of cartridge lots, (b) Variability of Instruments, (c)
Repeatability of Fingerstick Whole Blood Samples, and (d) Multi-site Reproducibility.
a. Variability of cartridge lots
The study was performed using three cartridge lots of Kenota 1 Total IgE on a single
Kenota 1 instrument using four fresh venous whole blood samples collected in lithium-
heparin anticoagulant-coated blood collection tubes. The total IgE for each sample was
measured in five replicates for each of three Kenota 1 Total IgE cartridge lots, two times
per day for five days by a single trained operator on one Kenota 1 instrument, resulting in
a total of 150 replicates per sample. The results are summarized in the tables below:

c. Repeatability of Fingerstick Whole Blood Samples
An estimate of repeatability of the Kenota 1 Total IgE test was determined using 355
fresh fingerstick whole blood samples covering the analytical measuring interval (AMI)
that were collected in the Minivette POCT lithium-heparin tubes. The study was
conducted in three CLIA-waived sites in the U.S. and the testing was performed by a
total of 11 untrained operators (three untrained operators at Site 1, three untrained
operators at Site 2, and five untrained operators at Site 3). Two different operators each
collected a separate fingerstick whole blood specimen from the same patient and tested
the sample on two or three Kenota 1 instruments at each site with a single lot of Kenota 1
Total IgE cartridge. The variability of two fingerstick numerical results was calculated
for each patient in five semi-quantitative categories. The SD for each semi-quantitative
category was calculated as the SD2 averaged over patients from the category. The results
of the repeatability evaluation are presented in the table below.

d. Multi-site Reproducibility
Multi-site reproducibility of the Kenota 1 Total IgE was evaluated at three CLIA-waived
sites using a single lot of Kenota 1 Total IgE external controls. The low and high controls
were tested by three untrained operators per site in two external control (EC) sessions per
day over seven different days using a single lot of Kenota 1 Total IgE cartridge, resulting
in a total of 126 data points per control. The result for different components of numeric
values is summarized below.

b. Hook Effect
The dynamic range of the Kenota 1 Total IgE for hook effect was evaluated using a series
of venous whole blood samples (1102–6300 kU/L) above the upper limit of the test’s
AMI prepared from a high contrived sample that was tested in five replicates per sample.
Samples with concentration of 1102 kU/L have: 20% (1 out 5) “Very High” results (541–
900 kU/L) and 80% (4 out 5) “>900 kU/L” results. Samples with concentrations of 1323,
2319, 3314, 4309, 5305, and 6300 kU/L had 100% (5 out 5) “>900 kU/L” results. No
hook effect was observed up to 6300 kU/L.
3. Interference and Cross-Reactivity:
a. Interference
Interference was evaluated according to CLSI document EP07-Ed3 and EP37-Ed1 by
testing human lithium-heparin venous whole blood samples at two IgE levels (low and

high category) for potential interfering substances. Each test sample was spiked with a
known amount of potentially interfering substances and analyzed at a minimum of six
replicates. The interference was calculated by comparing test samples spiked with the
potential interferents to control samples spiked with the same volume of diluent. When
interference was detected at the initial single dose testing, a dose-response assessment
was conducted to identify the amount of the interfering substance within ±10% difference
between the test and control sample. No significant interference was observed (within
±10% difference between the control and spiked sample) for the Kenota 1 Total IgE up to
the concentrations of the potential interfering and cross-reacting substances tested as
shown in the tables below.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range is the same as the analytical measuring interval (AMI) for the Kenota 1
Total IgE of 5–900 kU/L.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a. Traceability
The Total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) working calibrators are traceable to the primary
reference material WHO 3rd International Standard Human IgE (11/234).
b. Stability
A real-time stability study for the Kenota 1 Total IgE was performed in accordance with
the CLSI guideline EP25-Ed2.
Kenota 1 Total IgE (cartridge) stability
A real-time stability study was performed by testing three human plasma samples (low,
medium, and high) using three lots of Kenota 1 Total IgE cartridges paired with
Developing Solution on four Kenota 1 instruments (1 to 3 instruments per storage time
point) to evaluate performance of the Kenota 1 Total IgE at multiple time points. As a
worst-case scenario, each reagent lot was pre-stressed to environmental test conditions
that simulated potential winter (-20°C) and summer (40°C) transport profiles for 24 hours
and then stored at 21°C throughout the duration of the stability period. Results support
the claimed reagent shelf-life stability for the cartridge up to 5 months at 2–8°C.
Kenota 1 Total IgE external controls stability
A real-time stability study was performed by testing three lots of the Kenota 1 Total IgE
external low and high controls using one lot of the Kenota 1 Total IgE cartridge on one
Kenota 1 instrument at multiple time points. Each lot of the Kenota 1 Total IgE external
controls was stored at -20°C (recommended storage condition) or under pre-stressed
environmental test conditions at 18–25°C for 24 hours and then stored at -20°C
throughout the duration of the stability period. Results support the claimed shelf-life
stability of the Kenota 1 Total IgE external controls up to 5 months at -20°C.
Kenota 1 sample collection kit (SCK) and Kenota 1 Developing Solution (DS) stability
A real-time stability study was performed by testing two human venous whole blood
samples (low and high) using four lots of SCK and four lots of DS with one lot of the
Kenota 1 Total IgE cartridge on one Kenota 1 instrument at multiple time points. Two
SCK-DS lot pairs were stored at 31°C (recommended storage condition at 15–30°C) or

under pre-stressed environmental test conditions that simulated potential winter (-20°C)
and summer (40°C) transport profiles for 24 hours and then stored at 31°C throughout the
duration of the stability period. Results support the claimed SCK and DS shelf-life
stability up to 5 weeks at 15–30°C.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
studies were conducted in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
a. Limit of Blank (LoB)
The LoB was determined by testing three venous whole blood samples with low total IgE
concentrations <3 kU/L and one blank sample using whole blood matrix with no IgE.
Each blank /very low sample was tested in 10 replicates on two Kenota 1 instruments for
three days (one run per day), using two lots of Kenota 1 Total IgE cartridges to obtain a
total of 120 replicates per reagent lot. The LoB was estimated as the 95th percentile of the
measurements for each of the lots tested and determined to be the higher estimated LoB
from the two lots of Kenota 1 Total IgE cartridges. The LoB of Kenota 1 Total IgE was
determined as 1.8 kU/L.
b. Limit of Detection (LoD) / Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The LoD and LoQ were determined using four individual low venous whole blood
samples. Each LoD sample was tested in 10 replicates, for each of the two lots of Kenota
1 Total IgE cartridges, one run per day for three days to obtain a total of 30 replicates per
sample in each reagent lot. The LoD was calculated as the LoB + 1.645/ (1 - [1/4(B-K)])
x SD of the replicates for the low-level samples and determined to be the higher
estimated LoD from the two lots of Kenota 1 Total IgE cartridges. The LoD of Kenota 1
Total IgE was determined as 5.0 kU/L. The LoQ was calculated as a concentration with
allowable total error of |Bias|+2*SD≤5 kU/L and determined to be the higher estimated
LoQ from the two lots of Kenota 1 Total IgE cartridges. The LoQ of Kenota 1 Total IgE
was determined as the same as LoD of 5.0 kU/L.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable
8. Accuracy (Blood Collector / Instrument):
The performance of the blood collector was evaluated by recovery of test samples run on the
Kenota 1 instrument. Fresh venous whole blood was collected using two lots of Minivette
POCT Lithium-heparin, 100 μL (Sarstedt). Five blood collectors in each lot were used to
collect venous whole blood and prepare two test samples (low at ~ 50 kU/L and high at ~ 450
kU/L) for measuring recovery of IgE. The Standard IgE (3rd International Standard for serum
IgE, 11/234) was spiked into the test samples and the recovery was analyzed by the
‘measured increase of IgE’ over ‘expected increase of IgE’. The recovery bias was within ±
10% across two blood collector lots for the samples run on six Kenota 1 instruments.

9. Carry-Over:
Control and test carryover conditions were evaluated across four Kenota 1 instruments that
tested a venous whole blood sample in the ‘very low’ category (11.4 kU/L) immediately after
testing a sample in “>900 kU/L” category (1875 kU/L measured by the predicate). The IgE
level was measured in five consecutive cycles of testing ‘above measuring range sample –
very low sample’ for each instrument. No carry-over effect across four Kenota 1 instruments
was observed.

Devices (2014)) volunteer donors. All test samples were collected from individuals with no
known allergies or eczema and listing no allergy medications on Donor Information Forms, with
two replicates per sample. The reference interval was determined by calculating 2.5th and 97.5th
percentiles per CLSI EP28-A3c. The results are summarized in the table below.

climate change.”
F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
The Kenota 1 Total IgE is intended to be used at Point-of-Care (POC) sites, including allergist /
immunologist offices with a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Certificate
of Waiver. Operational limits of the Kenota 1 Total IgE were tested in the following series of
studies:
1. Temperature and Relative Humidity
A study was performed to evaluate whether performing tests using a Kenota 1 instrument and
Kenota 1 Total IgE cartridges at a wide range of temperature and relative humidity (RH)
conditions could lead to erroneous results. If the room temperature and/or humidity
conditions exceed the instrument’s limit (17–28°C, 10–90% RH) the instrument’s failure
alert check is triggered. The instruments and cartridges were exposed to seven test conditions
(see Test condition 2 to 8 below) and the test was performed using two fresh venous whole
blood samples (~ 45 kU/L and ~450 kU/L) in 10 replicates:
1) Control condition: 22°C, RH 37%
2) Test condition: 17°C, RH 6%
3) Test condition: 17°C, RH 88%
4) Test condition: 28°C, RH 11%
5) Test condition: 27°C, RH 86%
6) Test condition: 16°C, RH 32%
7) Test condition: 29°C, RH 22%
8) Test condition: 22°C, RH 96%
The test results were within ± 5% bias in Test Condition 2, 3, and 4 compared to Control
condition 1 above. The run was not initiated when the instrument detected the room
temperature and/or humidity conditions exceeding the instrument’s limit (17–28°C, 10–90%
RH) in Test condition 6, 7, and 8 above and the tablet screen displayed an error message
(e.g., ‘Room Temperature Too High’). This study demonstrates that the test reports valid
results only when the testing room temperature and/or relative humidity conditions are within
the instrument’s operating specification (17–28°C, 10–90% RH) based on the instrument’s
failure alert check.
2. Instrument on vibrating surface
A study was performed to evaluate whether performing tests using the instrument in
environments subject to vibrations leads to erroneous results. A fresh venous whole blood
sample (~ 200 kU/L) was tested in 24 replicates each on a surface with no/minimal
environmental vibrations and a surface with extreme environmental vibration. An unbalanced
K231151 - Page 14 of 16

--- Page 15 ---
centrifuge was run at 3000 RPM. A vibration meter was used to detect the vibration for one
minute at specific locations that were measured at 0.33g on the top of the centrifuge, 0.09g
on the table next to the centrifuge, 0.07g on the side of the instrument, and 0.16g on the top
of the instrument. This study demonstrates the test is unaffected (within ±5% bias) by
running a test on vibrating surface.
3. Instrument on tilted surface
A study was performed to evaluate whether performing tests using the instrument in
environments subject to tilted surface leads to erroneous results. If the tilted surface beyond
its specification limit is detected, the instrument’s failure alert check is triggered. A fresh
venous whole blood sample (~ 175 kU/L) was tested in a control condition (no tilt / 0 degree,
24 replicates), slight tilt (2 degrees, 24 replicates), moderate tilt (4 degrees, 3 replicates), and
high tilt (8 degrees, 3 replicates). The test results were within ±5% bias on front/back and
left/right tilt at ±2 degrees. The run was not initiated when the instrument detected a
front/back and left/right tilt at ±4 degrees and ±8 degrees, showing an error message “Tile
Error” on the tablet screen. This study demonstrates that the test reports valid results only
when the instrument is placed up to 2-degree tilted angle.
4. Sub-optimal lighting conditions
A study was performed to evaluate test performance when operators perform testing under
varying lighting conditions. A fresh venous whole blood sample was (~ 200 kU/L) tested in
48 replicates in each of the following conditions:
1) Control condition: office lighting ( 500 lux)
2) Test condition: direct sunlight ( 10000 lux)
3) Test condition: dark ( 5 lux) ≅
≅
The test results were with≅in ±5% bias in Test condition 2 and 3 compared to Test condition 1
above. This study demonstrates that the test operators were able to perform the tests in
various lighting conditions.
5. Mechanical impact on instrument
A study was performed to evaluate whether mechanical impacts (100g object dropped five
times from 30 cm) to the instrument could lead to biased results. A fresh venous whole blood
sample (~ 220 kU/L) was tested in 24 replicates in each of the following conditions:
1) Control condition: no mechanical impact
2) Test condition: mechanical impact during run initialization failure alert checks
3) Test condition: mechanical impact during sample dispensing
4) Test condition: mechanical impact during cartridge imaging
The test results were within ±5% bias in Test condition 2, 3 and 4 compared to Control
condition 1 above. This study demonstrates that the test is unaffected by mechanical impacts
on the instrument during different stages of testing.
K231151 - Page 15 of 16

--- Page 16 ---
6. Samples with air bubbles
A study was performed to determine the ability of the instrument’s failure alert check to
detect the presence of air bubbles in the sample after the instrument mixes the sample in the
sample collection kit (SCK). Air bubbles introduced into the SKC syringe are typically
resolved by the sample mixing performed by the instrument and unresolved bubbles are
assessed by a failure alert check, preventing SCK with large bubbles from beginning a run. If
air bubbles exceeding the size limit are detected by the instrument, the failure alert check is
triggered. A fresh venous whole blood sample (~ 194 kU/L) was tested in 24 replicates with
(Test condition) and without (Control condition) induced air bubbles. For the test condition,
air bubbles were intentionally introduced until two sample syringes passed the run
initialization failure alert checks (approximately 1–4 µL air bubble size). The test results
were within ±5% bias in Test condition compared to Control condition. This study
demonstrates that accurate results can be obtained if operators introduce air bubbles in the
test sample up to approximately 4 µL size.
7. Different cartridge positions within the sleeve
A study was performed to determine if the test results are affected by the location within the
stack of cartridges in the sleeve. Each sleeve holds up to 15 cartridges. A fresh venous whole
blood sample (~ 200 kU/L) was used to evaluate using cartridges in three different location
categories (Low: position 1–5, Middle: position 6–10, High: position 11–15). The sample
was tested in 12 runs with 5 replicates per run that generated a total of 60 replicates per
location category (e.g., 60 results from Low category). The average of test results was < ±5%
bias in comparison by the location category (Low, Middle, and High). This study
demonstrates that the test results are unaffected by different cartridge positions within the
sleeve.
