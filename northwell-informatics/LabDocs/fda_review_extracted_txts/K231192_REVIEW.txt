IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel is designed to quantitatively measure
the glucose concentration in fresh capillary whole blood from fingertip, palm or forearm.
K231192 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel consists of RIGHTEST Blood Glucose
Meter Max Tel, Blood Glucose Test Strip Max, RIGHTEST Control Solution GC700 (Level 1,
Level 2 and Level 4), RIGHTEST Lancing Device and Sterile Lancets (K221062). The
RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Test Strip Max is the same as Test Strip Max cleared in K173638.
The test strips, control solutions and Lancing Device can be purchased separately.
B Principle of Operation:
The RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel is designed to quantitatively
measure the glucose concentration in fresh capillary whole blood. The glucose measurement is
achieved by using the amperometric detection method that uses glucose dehydrogenase flavin-
adenine dinucleotide (GDH-FAD) based chemistry. When a drop of blood is applied to the test
strip it is pulled into the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with test
strip chemistry generating electrons and producing a current that is proportional to the glucose
concentration in the sample. After the reaction time, the detected current is calculated by the
meter and the resulting glucose concentration is displayed by the meter. The RIGHTEST Blood
Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel system reports glucose results as plasma glucose.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Meter Max Tel
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Fresh capillary whole blood from user’s fingertips, palm, or forearm. Samples are to be
tested immediately upon collection. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test
strip by capillary action.
4. Calibration:
No user calibration is required. The meter is automatically coded.
5. Quality Control:
Three levels of control solution (Level 1, Level 2, Level 4) are for use to perform quality
control testing to check whether the system is working properly. Instructions on when to
perform a control test, details about the control solution, performing a control test,
understanding out-of-range control results are provided in the labeling. User needs to enter
the control solution mode (CS mode) on the meter to perform a quality control test. Control
solution ranges are printed on the test strip vial label.

comparator method YSI 2300 Analyzer), 3 lots of test strips and 3 meters. Test procedures
were performed in 3 replicates per lot per concentration level. Blood glucose concentration
values obtained on the RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel were
compared to those obtained using comparator method YSI 2300 analyzer. The results of
linear regression analysis are summarized below:
Test Strip Lot # Slope y-intercept R2-value
Lot 1 1.0193 -0.145 0.9998
Lot 2 1.0202 0.1988 0.9998
Lot 3 1.0163 0.3926 0.9997
Combined 1.0186 0.1488 0.9998
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range from 50 -
550 mg/dL. The meter displays “LO” with glucose values below 50 mg/dL and “HI” with
glucose values over 550 mg/dL. The LO and HI functions were validated and were
demonstrated to function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To assess potential interference, studies were performed by spiking 31 exogenous and
endogenous substances into venous whole blood with three glucose levels (50-70, 110-130,
and 225-270 mg/dL; as measured on the comparator YSI 2300 Analyzer). Each of these
samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool, with the potential endogenous and
exogenous interfering substances added to the test pool. Each sample was tested in replicates
of 10. The difference between the test sample (with interferent) as measured on the meter and
the control sample (without interferent) as measured on the meter were calculated. The
highest tested concentrations of each substance tested with no significant interference
(defined by the sponsor as ≤ 10% between test and control mean) are summarized in the
following table:

of uric acid to rise to more than 12 mg/dL, the results from your meter may not be
correct.
• If you are taking a high level of vitamin C (ascorbic acid level in your blood > 3 mg/dL),
your blood glucose results may not be reliable. If you are unsure, ask your doctor.
• If you have a condition, such as jaundice, that may cause your blood levels of Conjugated
Bilirubin to rise to more than 30 mg/dL, the results from your meter may not be correct.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit Study
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max
Tel, venous blood samples were adjusted to 12 hematocrit levels of 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%,
30%, 35%, 42%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65% and 70%. Each hematocrit level was tested at five
glucose levels (~40 mg/dL, ~100 mg/dL, ~120 mg/dL, ~200 mg/dL, and ~340 mg/dL).
Results from the meter were compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based
comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results support the labeled hematocrit claim of
10-70%.
2. Altitude Study
To evaluate the effect of altitude on the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel,
meters were tested at 0 ft (m), 3280 ft (1000 m), 6561 ft (2000 m), and 10,745 ft (3275 m)
above sea level. Venous blood samples were prepared at three glucose concentration levels
(~45 mg/dL, ~130 mg dL, and ~350 mg/dL) and tested at each altitude. Results were
compared to results obtained using a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI 2300
analyzer) and demonstrated that altitudes up to 10,745 ft (3275 m) above sea level have no
significant effect on blood glucose measurements.
3. Sample Volume Study
To verify the minimum sample volume claim, venous whole blood samples with nine
volumes (0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 1.00, 1.25, 2.00, and 3.00 μL) were tested using three
meters and three test strip lots. Sample concentrations included three glucose levels (61
mg/dL, 106 mg/dL, and 237 mg/dL) and were tested at each volume. Values obtained with
the candidate device were compared to values obtained using the comparator method (YSI
2300 analyzer). Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.75 μL. The meter
displays and error message when insufficient sample volume is applied to the test strip. The
sponsor provided validation studies demonstrating that this error feature functions as
intended.
4. System Operating Conditions Study
The effect of temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated using venous
blood samples to evaluate temperatures ranging from 6°C (42.8°F) to 44°C (111.2°F) and
relative humidity from 10% to 90%. Six temperature and humidity combinations were tested
including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high
temperature/low humidity, and high temperature/high humidity. Values were compared to
results from the comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results support the sponsor’s

claimed operating conditions in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 43-
111℉ (6-44℃) and relative humidity from 10-90%.
5. Flex Studies
The following additional flex studies were performed with the Rightest Blood Glucose
Monitoring System Max Tel: intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, drop and vibration,
testing with used test strips and interruption of testing. The testing demonstrated that the
device is robust to these conditions.
6. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Testing
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and EMC
testing was performed and the system was found to be compliant.
7. Infection Control Studies
The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel is intended for single-patient use
only. Disinfection efficacy testing on the external surface materials of the meter
demonstrated complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant,
CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA Registration Number 46781-8). Robustness studies
were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance
or in the external materials of the meter after 550 cleaning and disinfection cycles using the
CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5
years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8. Test Strip Lot Release Protocol
The test strip lot release protocols and criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
