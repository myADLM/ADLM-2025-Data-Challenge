previous infection of varicella-zoster virus. The test must be performed on the LIAISON XL
Analyzer. The assay performance in detecting antibodies to VZV in individuals vaccinated with
the FDA-licensed VZV vaccine is unknown. The user of this assay is responsible for establishing
the performance characteristics with VZV vaccinated individuals.
B Indication(s) for Use:

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The LIAISON XL Analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The LIAISON VZV IgG HT assay requires the use of reagents specific for VZV IgG
immunoassay and the recommended LIAISON Control VZV IgG HT. The reagent and
calibrators are packaged together in the LIAISON VZV IgG HT kit, while the LIAISON Control
VZV IgG HT is packaged separately. The assay is performed on the LIAISON XL Analyzer, a
fully automated system with continuous loading system that performs the complete sample
processing (sample pre-dilutions, sample and reagent dispensing, incubations, wash processes)
and the measurement and evaluation.
The assay contains different components: reagent integral (magnetic particles, conjugate, assay
buffer, and calibrator), and external controls (positive and negative).
B Principle of Operation:
The LIAISON VZV IgG HT assay is an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) used
for the qualitative detection of specific IgG antibodies to varicella-zoster virus (VZV). During
the first incubation with the magnetic particles, anti-VZV antibodies, if present in calibrators,
samples, or controls, bind to VZV antigen coated on magnetic particles (solid phase). During the
second incubation, the antibody conjugate (anti-human mouse monoclonal antibody conjugated
to isoluminol derivative) reacts with any human anti-VZV IgG already bound to the solid phase.
After each incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the
starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light
signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate in the sample, is measured by a
photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is indicative of the presence of absence of anti-
VZV IgG antibodies in calibrators, samples, or controls.
Interpretation of Results: The presence or absence of VZV IgG antibodies in the specimens is
determined by comparing the chemiluminescence reaction signal to the cut-off value provided by
the assay calibration. The LIAISON XL analyzer automatically calculates the signal-to-cutoff
(S/CO) ratios, and interprets the results as presented in Table 1.

antibodies to VZV below the threshold.
A result above or equal to 1.00 S/CO generally indicates exposure of the
≥1.00 Positive
subject to VZV.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
LIAISON XL Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is automated using LIAISON XL Analyzer. The assay is intended
for use with the following matrices: Serum (with gel and without gel-SST), dipotassium
EDTA (K2- EDTA), lithium heparin and sodium heparin plasma.

Potential cross-reactivity for the LIAISON VZV IgG HT assay was determined by testing
specimens (serum, K2 EDTA plasma and Li Heparin plasma samples) from individuals with
antibodies to different microorganisms or with other medical conditions unrelated to VZV
(bacterial and viral infections as well as autoimmune disorders). No false positive results
were observed. The data provided showed no cross-reactivity with the potential cross-
reactants tested.

b. Endogenous and Exogenous Interfering Substances:
The LIAISON VZV IgG HT assay was evaluated for potential interference caused by
endogenous and exogenous substances using VZV IgG antibody-negative, high negative,
around the cut-off, low positive, and high positive samples. No interference was observed
with the endogenous and exogenous interference substances at the concentration listed in the
table below.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not Applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Not Applicable.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The study was performed to determine the LIAISON VZV IgG HT assay S/CO cutoff. A
total of 90 samples with 42 VZV IgG antibody negative samples, and 48 VZV IgG antibody
positive samples were included. A receiver-operator curve analysis showed a clear separation
of the non-reactive and reactive results using a cut-off of 1.00 S/CO value.
8. Analytical Sensitivity at cutoff:
The analytical sensitivity of the LIAISON VZV IgG HT assay was determined using a series
of serial dilutions of the WHO First International Standard for varicella zoster
immunoglobulin (1987), NIBSC code: W1044 in negative serum matrix. Three lots of the
LIAISON VZV IgG HT assay were used. The data was analyzed by regression analysis,
considering the best fit. The cut-off in mIU/mL was identified as the corresponding to 1.00
S/CO on the regression analysis. The analytical sensitivity at the cutoff is the higher
concentration among the 3 lots for the reference standard that corresponds to the cut-off
value of 1.00 S/CO for LIAISON VZV IgG HT assay is 0.1524 IU/mL (152.4 mIU/mL).
9. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable
10. Sample Carry-Over:
The LIAISON VZV IgG HTis not susceptible to within-assay sample carry-over.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison Study:
Clinical Agreement Study:
A multisite clinical agreement study was conducted to evaluate the clinical performance of the
LIAISON VZV IgG HT test. One thousand five hundred and forty-four (1544) clinical human
serum samples were used for this study, including 125 known positive specimens, 200 known
K231214 - Page 10 of 13

negative specimens, 135 pregnant women specimens and 1084 specimens sent to the laboratory
for testing.
The samples were collected within the United States and tested at three independent external
laboratories. Each sample, was tested with the LIAISON VZV IgG HT test and the comparator.
The positive and negative percent agreements were calculated and presented below for normal
laboratory routine (all), normal laboratory routine pediatric, and pregnant women. Specimens
which were repeatedly equivocal by the predicate device were graded against the performance of
the LIAISON VZV IgG HT assay which does not have an equivocal zone. The results for all
populations are shown in the tables below.

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix equivalency study was conducted including 87 sets of matched reactive and
nonreactive samples of different matrices (serum, with and without gel STT, dipotassium
EDTA plasma, lithium-heparin plasma, and sodium heparin plasma) that were evaluated with
the LIAISON VZV IgG HT assay. Data was analyzed using Passing Bablok fit regression
comparing mean value results of all matrices to serum.
The following tube types are acceptable for use with the LIAISON VZV IgG HT assay:
• Serum (with and without gel STT)
• Plasma (dipotassium EDTA, lithium heparin, sodium heparin).
