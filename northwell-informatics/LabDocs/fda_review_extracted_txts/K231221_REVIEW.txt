were tested on different days (2 vials x 1 lot x 1 day, for 10 days and 3 different lots) for a
total of 180 runs (90 runs per MDx-Chex for BC-GP positive and negative control) were
generated for data analysis from all testing sites and all MDx-Chex for BC-GP lots.
All samples were prepared and analyzed on the Luminex VERIGENE System Instrument per
the control Instructions for Use. This resulted in a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100%
(90/90) for the MDx-Chex for BC-GP Positive Control (Table 1) and a negative percent
agreement (NPA) of 100% (90/90) for the MDx-Chex for BC-GP Negative Control (Table

The results support the reproducibility of the MDx-Chex for BC-GP across three separately

Repeatability
An internal repeatability study was conducted to assess performance of MDx-Chex for BC-
GP using at least two Luminex VERIGENE systems. The testing schedule consisted of
evaluating MDx-Chex for BC-GP positive and negative controls across three lots for over 20
days for a total of 120 runs. Samples were prepared according to MDx-Chex for BC-GP
control instructions. Samples were analyzed on the Luminex VERIGENE System per the
Instructions for Use. Five to six operators tested each control using 3-4 Luminex BC-GP
panel lots and 4 Luminex VERIGENE systems. This resulted in a PPA of 100% (60/60) for
the MDx-Chex for BC-GP Positive Control (Table 3) and a NPA of 100% (60/60) for the
MDx-Chex for BC-GP Negative Control (Table 4).

Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility
Lot-to-lot reproducibility was demonstrated by testing three lots of MDx-Chex for BC-GP.
Samples were prepared per the control Instructions for Use (IFU) prior to testing with the
same Luminex BC-GP panel lot on one Luminex VERIGENE System over multiple days.
Ten positive and negative MDx-Chex for BC-GP control tubes were tested on the same
VERIGENE System for 60 data points total (30 per lot per positive and negative control). All
MDx-Chex for BC-GP positive and negative control lots passed with ≥ 90% positive or

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Closed-vial Stability
A real-time closed-vial stability study is ongoing using three lots of MDx-Chex for BC-GP
with currently available data summarized below. Twenty positive and negative control
samples representing three different lots of MDx-Chex for BC-GP were stored at room
(25˚C) and refrigerated temperatures (2-8˚C) and collected at different timepoints for testing.
Samples were tested at day zero (ship date) and later time points for each lot and storage
condition. Samples were prepared and analyzed on the Luminex VERIGENE systems per
MDx-Chex for BC-GP assay Instructions for Use.
The study is ongoing and will support the use of the MDx-Chex for BC-GP control kit
throughout their labeled shelf life.
Shipping Stability
A shipping stability study was performed to validate the stability of MDx-Chex for BC-GP
during shipment. One of the MDx-Chex for BC-GP lots from each storage temperature (2°C
and 25°C) was subjected to simulated winter and summer shipping temperature profiles over
5 days. Data was collected from 20 samples per positive and negative control for each
simulated shipping profile within the 60-day closed-vial stability testing period. Temperature
stress conditions for summer and winter include a 120-hour exposure period with the
following temperature profile presented in Table 7:

The matrix of MDx-Chex for BC-GP is made of stabilized blood components (erythrocytes
and leukocytes) in a simulated blood culture media. Since the matrix is not identical to that of
the routine Luminex BC-GP assay sample, blood culture media, a test was performed to
investigate the effect of the matrix on the assay.
To confirm that the simulated blood culture matrix does not impact performance of the
