III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes are evacuated, sterile, single use, in vitro
diagnostic medical devices available with Sodium Fluoride/Potassium Oxalate or Sodium
Fluoride/Na2EDTA. They are intended to be used by trained healthcare professionals for the
collection, containment, preservation, transportation, and centrifugation of venous blood
specimens as required for in vitro diagnostic testing. Plastic BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood
Collection Tubes are used to collect whole blood for the generation of plasma samples.
Blood collected in BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes containing Sodium
Fluoride/Potassium Oxalate are used for glucose and lactate determinations. Blood collected in
BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes containing Sodium Fluoride/Na2EDTA are
used for glucose determinations.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Do not use if foreign matter is present or if tube is damaged.
Fluoride powdered additives may be white to pale pink. Do not use if it is any other color.
Follow your facility’s procedures if clots or other visible obstructions are present in the sample
as this could lead to the inability to test the sample.
Any change in blood collection tube type, size, handling, processing, or storage condition for a
particular laboratory assay should be evaluated by the laboratory for each instrument/reagent
system per the laboratory's standard procedures.
BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes may contain trace levels of tert‑butanol,
ethylbenzene, formate, hexane, 2‑methylpentane, 3‑methylpentane, and xylene. It has not been
determined if the presence of trace levels of these compounds will affect test results in
chromatography‑based assays.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable. Specific analyzers used to evaluate the device are listed in the labeling and in
section VII.B.1. Method Comparison, below.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
K231237 - Page 2 of 8

--- Page 3 ---
The BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes are evacuated, sterile, single use tubes
intended to be used in settings where venous blood samples would be collected by trained
healthcare professionals for the collection, containment, preservation, transportation, and
centrifugation of blood in a closed tube.
BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes are available in plastic13 x 75mm and 13 x
100mm configurations with draw volumes from 2.0 to 6 mL. The configurations contain various
additive combinations in a blended powder mixture, including the additives Potassium Oxalate
(kOx) and Na -EDTA which provide an anticoagulated specimen when used according to the
2
instructions for use. The tubes containing Na -EDTA can be used to produce plasma samples to
2
measure glucose. The tubes containing kOx can be used to produce plasma samples to measure
glucose or lactate. The blended powder mixture contains sodium fluoride (NaF), which acts as an
antiglycolytic agent. Tubes include a gray color‑coded BD Hemogard™ Closure indicative of the
NaF additive. Tube stoppers are lubricated with silicone to facilitate stopper insertion.
B Principle of Operation:
The BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes are intended to be placed inside any BD
Vacutainer® Needle Holder of the standard size or an adapter of a blood collection system. Once
the vein of the patient has been penetrated using a standard needle, center the collection tube in
the holder and push the tube fully onto the needle, puncturing the stopper of the tube. The tube
uses a controlled vacuum to pull a specific volume of blood into the sterile interior of the tube.
Once the pressure is equalized, the blood flow ceases, and the tube is removed from the needle
holder or needle. Immediately after the blood has been drawn, the tube is gently inverted 8 times
to mix the blood with the anticoagulant and antiglycolytic. The BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood
Collection Tubes are centrifuged at 2000 RCF (relative centrifuge force or g’s). The whole blood
is then processed to plasma for various clinical laboratory testing.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two studies were conducted to evaluate the repeatability (within-tube), lot-to-lot (between
lots), and tube-to-tube (between tube) variation in the BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood
Collection Tubes. Sodium Fluoride/ Potassium Oxalate (NaF/KOx) tubes were tested and
evaluated using glucose and lactate, and Sodium Fluoride EDTA (NaF/Na EDTA) tubes
2
were tested and evaluated using glucose. The study designs included subjects from the
clinical settings. Three lots of each of the BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood Collection Tubes
(candidate device) were used in the study. The study was performed using samples collected
from 25 subjects for glucose and 40 subjects for lactate, and all samples were run in duplicate
on two instrument platforms. One representative platform with precision results is
summarized in the tables below:

Benchtop studies were conducted to evaluate interference from stopper materials over the
sample storage time. Study protocols, acceptance criteria, and results for this study were
provided and found to be acceptable.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
A. Within-Tube Stability (sample stability):
Glucose (GLU) and lactate stability studies were conducted to assess within-tube
stability for BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood Collection tubes using NaF/ Na EDTA
2
13x75 2mL tubes for glucose determinations and NaF/KOx 13x75 4mL for glucose
and lactate determinations. Stability studies were assessed for glucose up to 24hr.
Lactate studies were assessed up to 45 minutes while the samples were stored in tubes
on ice, followed by refrigerated storage and centrifugation. Analyte stability was
tested on a minimum of two instrument platforms. The study protocols and
acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. These studies
support the storage of samples for measurement of lactate up to 45 minutes when held
on ice and glucose up to 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours when refrigerated.
B. Shelf-Life
Real Time stability testing of the BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood Collection tubes
showed that the candidate device is stable for 15-16 months when stored at 4 to 25°C.
The stability study protocol and acceptance criteria has been reviewed and found to
be acceptable. The claimed shelf-life of each tube is shown below:
Fluoride Blood Tube Claimed Shelf-life Volume
NaF/Na EDTA 16 months 2 mL
2
NaF/KOx 15 months 2 mL
NaF/KOx 16 months 4 mL
NaF/KOx 15 months 6 mL
C. Additional bench testing on the candidate device
Benchtop studies were conducted to assess draw volume, X-value, 2nd stopper
pullout, stopper/shield separation, stopper leakage, tube leakage, breakage resistance
during drop testing, breakage resistance during centrifugation testing, barrier
formation and packaging performance during shipping and handling. The study
protocols were reviewed, and performance was considered acceptable.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
A study was conducted to evaluate equivalence between the BD Vacutainer® Fluoride Blood
Collection Tubes (6 mL BD Vacutainer® Sodium Fluoride / Potassium Oxalate and 2 mL
BD Vacutainer® Sodium Fluoride / Na2EDTA) and a cleared comparator tube (NaF/K
Oxalate Blood Collection Tubes, 2 mL) for testing glucose and lactate. All samples were
collected by routine venipuncture using standard phlebotomy techniques. In addition,
contrived samples were prepared to obtain results that spanned the analytical measurement
range for the tested analytes. Glucose and Lactate were evaluated on two instrument
platforms each and demonstrated comparable results between the candidate tubes and the
comparator tubes.
Immediately after collection and prior to centrifugation, tubes were inspected for complete
fill, clot formation and stopper leakage. After centrifugation, additional visual assessments
were performed. Tubes were then handled and processed according to manufacturer’s
recommended handling conditions for tube inversions and centrifugation time and force.
Biases between tube types were estimated with 95% confidence intervals. Regression
analyses for a representative tube using each instrument platform are provided in the tables
below:
