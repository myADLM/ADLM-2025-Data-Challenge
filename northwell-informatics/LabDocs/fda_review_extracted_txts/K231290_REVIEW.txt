III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Optilite Freelite Kappa Free Kit is intended for the quantitative in vitro measurement of
Kappa free light chains in serum using the Binding Site Optilite analyzer. Measurement of free
light chains aids in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma, lymphocytic neoplasms,
Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, AL amyloidosis, light chain deposition disease and
connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and aids in the
evaluation of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Results of the
free light chain measurements should always be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory
and clinical findings.

Precaution:
Evaluation of monoclonal gammopathy of undertermined significance (MGUS):
• The performance has not been sufficiently studied in Light Chain MGUS patients.
• Patients with renal disease or inflammation may have elevated levels of kappa and lambda
free light chains (FLC).
• Sample populations excluded MGUS populations that were further diagnosed with a
disease/disorder in subsequent testing with another medical device such as neoplasia, and
infectious diseases including human immunodeficiency virus. Thus, the specificity of the test
may be inflated.
• The performance has not been fully evaluated on all race/ethnicity in the intended use
population.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Optilite Analyzer (K141100)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
No modification is made to the kit components for the Optilite Freelite Kappa and Lambda Free
Kits cleared in K150658. The assays are comprised of the following reagents:
• Latex Reagent: Consisting of polyclonal monospecific antibody coated onto polystyrene latex
with preservatives, supplied in stabilized liquid form.
• Calibrator and Controls: Pooled human serum with preservatives, supplied in stabilized liquid
form.
• Reaction Buffer: Containing 0.099% sodium azide as a preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
No modification is made to the principle of operation for the Optilite Freelite Kappa and Lambda
Free Kits cleared in K150658.
The concentration of the soluble antigen is assessed by turbidimetry. The test sample is added to
a solution containing the appropriate antibody in a reaction cuvette. A beam of light is passed
through the cuvette and is increasingly scattered by the formation of insoluble immune
complexes. Light scatter is monitored by measuring the decrease in intensity of the incident
beam of light. The antibody in the cuvette is in excess so the amount of immune complex formed
is proportional to the antigen concentration. A series of calibrators of known antigen
concentration are assayed to produce a calibration curve of measured light scatter versus antigen
concentration. Samples of unknown antigen concentration can then be assayed, and the results
read from the calibration curve.

C Clinical Studies:
MGUS is a clinically asymptomatic premalignant clonal plasma cell or lymphoplasmacytic
proliferative disorder. The performance of the Optilite Freelite Kappa and Lambda Free Kits as
an aid in the evaluation of MGUS was investigated from the following retrospective clinical
studies:
Study 1:
A retrospective study was performed by testing a total of 234 samples from clinically confirmed
MGUS patients (with IFE positivity) and a total of 140 samples from clinically defined non-
MGUS patients with polyclonal immunostimulation (confirmed with SPEP/SIFE). Clinical
diagnostic criteria and classification for MGUS and related plasma-cell disorders were, as
practiced clinically, fulfilled, but were not limited to the criteria outlined by the ‘International
Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)’ consensus. The result of the device was compared to the
clinical diagnosis for each sample.
The cohort of 234 MGUS samples included 174 non-IgM MGUS, 24 IgM MGUS, 12 light chain
(LC) MGUS and 24 Biclonal. All samples were tested for FLC kappa and lambda levels with the
Optilite Freelite Kappa and Lambda Free kits on the Optilite Analyzer. FLC ĸ/λ ratios were also
calculated for each sample. The test result for MGUS positive or negative were based on the
following criteria:
• For Non-LC MGUS, the test was considered as “MGUS Positive” or “Abnormal” when
abnormal FLC ĸ/λ ratio (outside reference interval, i.e., <0.26 or >1.65) with IFE positivity
was determined.
• For LC MGUS, the test was considered as “MGUS Positive” when abnormal FLC ĸ/λ ratio
(outside reference interval, i.e., <0.26 or >1.65) with elevated FLC kappa (>19.40 mg/L) or
elevated FLC lambda FLC (> 26.30 mg/L) was determined.
One hundred thirty-nine (139) out of 234 MGUS cases were tested positive by the Optilite
Freelite Kappa Free Kit and Optilite Freelite Lambda Free Kit with a positive rate of 59.4%
(95% CI: 53.0 – 65.5%). The distribution of the cohort and the positivity rate for each clinical
type of MGUS are summarized in the following table:

have been categorized as non-IgM MGUS based on associated IFE and FLC results
generated for these samples.
The 140 samples from patients with confirmed non-MGUS polyclonal stimulation (polyclonal
hypergammaglobulinemia) were comprised of autoimmune diseases (27); diabetes (21);
cardiovascular diseases (12); liver diseases (11); renal diseases (8); infection/inflammation (5);
endocrine disorders (4); respiratory diseases (3); cancers (2); and other diseases/conditions
(anemia, arthralgia, back pain, thigh pain, bone pain, elevated globulin levels, hypocalcemia,
iron deficiency, joint pain, leg pain, low Hb, low sodium, malaise, morning stiffness, night
sweats, neutrophilia, raised calculated globulin, raised CRP, rash and itch, recurrent UTIs,
TATT- tired all the time, tiredness, weight loss) (47). Among 140 non-MGUS samples, 121 of
these were determined as negative by the Optilite Freelite Kappa Free Kit and Optilite Freelite
Lambda Free Kit, indicating a negative agreement of 86.4% (95% CI: 79.8–91.1%) in this
sample cohort. The 19 false positive samples were from patients with the following disorders:
diabetes (2); renal diseases (3); infection/inflammation (2); liver diseases (1); autoimmune
diseases (6); endocrine disorders (1) and other diseases/conditions (4).
Study 2:
Another retrospective study was performed by testing 45 subjects with clinically stable MGUS
and four subjects with progressive clinical status converting from MGUS to multiple myeloma
(MM). Among 45 MGUS stable subjects, 39 patients were diagnosed with non-IgM MGUS (20
IgG K, 14 IgG L, two IgA K, and three IgA L), and six patients with IgM MGUS (four IgM K
and two IgM L). All four subjects with progressive disease status were initially diagnosed with
non-IgM MGUS (one IgG K, and three IgG L).
At least four serial draws were collected from each patient and tested with the Optilite Freelite
Kappa Free Kit and Optilite Freelite Lambda Free Kit. FLC κ/λ ratio was calculated for each
blood draw sample. Since the MGUS has been identified as a precursor to malignant diseases
(multiple myeloma or amyloidosis), but not as a disease which requires treatment, no defined
criteria in how to interpret consecutive FLC results are available. Therefore, for device
evaluation purposes only, the criteria for stable MGUS and progressive MGUS based on test
results in this study is defined as follows:
• FLC stable: Stable MGUS defined as < 25% increase in the concentration of the involved
FLC in two assessments taken at least 6 months +/- 2 months apart where possible. This
analysis included MGUS patients with and without abnormal FLC κ/λ ratio.
• FLC progressive: Progressive MGUS defined as the FLC κ/λ ratio outside of the
reference interval of 0.26 –1.65, and an increase of ≥ 25% in the concentration of the

involved light chain at or preceding the diagnosis of MM, compared to a previous sample
taken at least 6 months +/- 2 months where possible.
Forty-two (42) out of 45 clinically stable MGUS subjects except LC MGUS, were determined as
stable by the test and two out of four clinically progressive subjects were determined as
progressive by these tests.
Limitations
• The performance has not been sufficiently studied in Light Chain (LC) MGUS patients – 12
LC MGUS patient samples were tested in Study 1, no LC MGUS patient samples were tested
in Study 2.
• The performance has not been fully evaluated on all race/ethnicity in the intended use
population.
• The study included time points of blood draws not indicative of clinical practice. The
algorithm using only FLC has not been validated for progression of disease. Furthermore, a
small sample size (4 patients) with only one specific subtype (i.e., IgG MGUS only) was
used to study progression in Study 2. Risk mitigation strategies include that this test is not a
stand-alone test for the evaluation of patients with MGUS and the test is to be utilized in
conjunction with serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation blood tests.
