IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Aptima Trichomonas vaginalis (Aptima TV) assay is a nucleic acid amplification test,
intended for the in vitro qualitative detection of ribosomal RNA from Trichomonas vaginalis
(TV) in clinician-collected and patient-collected vaginal swabs, clinician-collected endocervical
swabs, male and female urine, and specimens collected in PreservCyt solution. The assay
involves the technologies of target capture, transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), and
hybridization protection assay (HPA). Assay test results are automatically interpreted by the Panther
system Aptima TV assay software. A test result may be negative, positive, or invalid as determined
by total RLU in the detection step. The current Aptima TV assay is similar to the assay cleared
earlier (K122062) for use on the Panther System. There are no changes to the Aptima TV assay
reagents and accessories. The Aptima Urine Specimen Collection Kit is required for the collection
of male or female urine specimens. The Aptima Multitest Swab Specimen Collection Kit is
intended to be used for collection and transport of clinician and patient collected vaginal swabs.
K231316 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The Aptima TV assay utilizes target capture, transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), and
hybridization protection assay (HPA). The TMA reaction amplifies a specific region of the small
ribosomal subunit from TV via DNA and RNA intermediates and generates RNA amplicon
molecules. Detection of the rRNA amplification product sequences is achieved using nucleic acid
based HPA. A labeled DNA probe combines with amplicon to form stable RNA: DNA hybrids.
During the detection step, light emitted from the labeled RNA: DNA hybrids is measured as
photon signals in a luminometer and are reported as Relative Light Units (RLU). Please refer to
the decision summary of K122062 for detailed description.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Panther System
2. Specimen Identification:
By handheld barcode reader and manual entry.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Fully automated
4. Calibration:
The Aptima TV assay requires no calibration. The PANTHER System undergoes Preventive

For this submission, Aptima TV assay reproducibility on the Panther system was evaluated by
testing panel members created using unique pools of negative urine specimens with Urine
Transport Medium (UTM) spiked with varying concentrations of a stock solution of lysed TV
organisms diluted in UTM. Final TV concentrations ranged from 0.003 TV/mL to 1 TV/mL. The
study was conducted at two external US laboratories and at Hologic, using two lots of assay
reagents and a total of six operators (two at each site), testing each sample in three replicates.
At each site, testing was performed over at least 6 days. The summary of reproducibility results
is presented in Table 1 below.

2. Linearity:
Aptima TV assay is a qualitative assay, therefore a linearity study is not applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical Specificity-Cross Reactivity and Microbial Interference
Analytical specificity of the Aptima TV assay was evaluated for cross-reactivity by testing
various microorganisms, including common flora of the genitourinary tract, opportunistic
organisms, and closely related organisms. Testing was conducted in urine in UTM with 25
replicates of each panel comprising of three different microorganisms per panel. The list of
organisms and the concentrations tested are provided in Table 2. The Aptima TV Assay was also
evaluated for microbial interference by testing the same organisms (Table 2) in urine in STM
spiked with TV lysate to a final concentration of 0.01 TV/mL This microorganism is found in the
gastrointestinal tract and not likely to be found in cervical, urine, or vaginal samples. Please refer
to K122062 for the cross-reactivity/microbial interference studies conducted for previously
claimed matrices in support of Aptima TV assay.

Interfering Substances
The analytical performance of the Aptima TV assay was evaluated in the presence of a panel of
potentially interfering substances that may be found in urine samples. Each potential interferent was
organized in panels comprising of representatives of personal lubricant, personal deodorant, anti-
fungal agents, and representatives of spermicide and intravaginal hormone (Table 3). Additionally,
porcine mucin (used to simulate the major biological component of cervical mucus), seminal fluid
from 25 subjects, whole blood, glacial acetic acid and commercially prepared Kova-Trol I were used
to evaluate the interference from endogenous substances (commercially available Kova-Trol I is a
ready-to-use liquid control at clinically high concentrations). Each potential interferent was spiked
into urine/ UTM diluted samples, containing TV organisms at the concentration of 0.01 TV/mL, to
a final indicated concentration (vol/vol, V/V or wt/vol, W/V), as shown in Table 3. Additionally,
each interferent was spiked into urine/ UTM with no TV present. Tests for all interference
substances, with the exception of glacial acetic acid, mucin and astroglide lubricant, generated
expected results, demonstrating that the substances listed at the concentrations shown in Table 3, do
not interfere with the Aptima TV assay. Glacial acetic acid, mucin and astroglide lubricant interfered
with performance of TV detection at concentration of 0.01 TV/mL causing false negative results.
However. these substances did not interfere with TV detection when tested at higher concentrations,
i.e., of 0.3 TV/mL when tested in the presence of astroglide lubricant, and 1 TV/mL when tested in
the presence of mucin and glacial acetic acid. Please refer to K122062 for the interference studies
conducted for previously claimed matrices in support of Aptima TV assay.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The stability of urine specimens was evaluated in an analytical study which used individual
negative female urine specimens spiked with freshly cultured TV and replicates tested at baseline
and after storage. The study results demonstrated urine samples are stable when stored neat for 24
hours at 30°C and when stored in UTM for 30 days at 30°C or up to 24 months at -20°C.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) for the Aptima TV assay was determined by testing two quantified
(TV/mL) strains of TV spiked into negative pools of female urine matrix. One batch of each
cultured TV strain, ATCC #30236 (metronidazole-sensitive strain) and ATCC #50138
(metronidazole-resistant strain) were used in this study. Results demonstrated greater than 95%
positivity for both strains of TV at 0.01 TV/mL in urine specimen matrix. Please refer to K122062

Clinical Performance
The clinical performance of the Aptima TV assay on the Panther system with urine (male and
female) and self-collected vaginal specimens, was evaluated in a prospective, multicenter clinical
study.
Symptomatic and asymptomatic men and women were enrolled at 11 geographically and
ethnically diverse US clinical sites, including obstetrics and gynecology, family planning, and STI
clinics.
Up to five specimens were collected from each female subject (four patient-collected vaginal
swabs, one first-catch urine), and one first catch urine specimen was collected from each male
subject. All specimens were collected by the subject at the clinical sites.
Of the specimens collected, 5922 were processed in valid Aptima TV assay runs. Of these, 225
samples generated invalid results upon initial testing (invalid rate of 3.8%, 95% CI: 3.3%-4.3%);
after retesting, 89 samples remained invalid.
The clinical performance of the Aptima TV assay with vaginal swabs and female and male urine
was evaluated testing each sample with up to three FDA-cleared NAATs for detection of TV.
Specimens were categorized as “infected” (patient infected status, PIS) for vaginal swabs and
male urine and as “positive” (composite comparator algorithm, CCA) for female urine if a
positive result occurred in at least two of the comparator NAAT results, and as “not infected”/
K231316 - Page 9 of 11

--- Page 10 ---
“negative” if at least two of the comparator results were negative; the third (tie-breaker) NAAT
was only required if the first two NAAT results were discordant. Specimens that could not be
categorized as infected/positive or not infected/negative due to missing results from the
comparator assays were excluded from the performance analyses.
A total of 5502 specimens from 3820 evaluable subjects were included in the analyses comparing
Aptima TV assay results to the PIS or CCA interpretation: 1785 patient- collected vaginal swabs,
1782 female urine specimens, and 1935 male urine specimens.
Performance characteristics of the Aptima TV assay, are shown below in Table 4 and 5.

FU = female urine, TP = true positive, FP = false positive, TN = true negative, FN = false negative,
PPA = positive percent agreement, NPA = negative percent agreement. ATV= Aptima TV assay
The sensitivity of the Aptima TV assay on the Panther system in female urine specimens was also
assessed compared to three comparator NAAT results obtained by testing patient-collected vaginal
swabs (PIS). The data showed that the detection of TV infection in female urine specimens by the
Aptima TV assay is up to 2.4% lower than when testing vaginal swab specimens when compared to
PIS.
