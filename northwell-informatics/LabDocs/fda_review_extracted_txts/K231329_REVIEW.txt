IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Aptima Neisseria gonorrhoeae Assay is a nucleic acid amplification test that utilizes the
target capture (TC), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) and hybridization protection
assay (HPA) technologies for the qualitative detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Male urine is
collected and transferred using the collection kit. The transport solution in the kit tube releases
the rRNA target that are then captured by magnetic microparticles. A unique set of primers is
used to amplify the target and the amplicon is detected by nucleic acid hybridization. Assay test
results are automatically interpreted by the Panther System Aptima GC assay software.
This assay is similar to the Aptima Assay for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (K063664) in that the target
organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The primary differences between the two assays are the
platform on which the assay is performed. There are no modifications to assay reagents.
B Principle of Operation:
The Aptima Neisseria gonorrhoeae Assay combines the technologies of target capture, TMA,
and HPA. Male urine is collected and transferred using the collection kit. The transport solution
in these tubes releases the rRNA target and protects it from degradation during storage. The
target rRNA molecule is isolated from the specimens by use of a capture oligomer via target
capture that utilizes magnetic microparticles. The capture oligomer contains a sequence
complementary to a specific region of the target molecule, as well as a string of deoxyadenosine
K231329 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
residues. During the hybridization step, the sequence specific region of the capture oligomer
binds to a specific region of the target molecule. The capture oligomer: target complex is then
captured out of solution by decreasing the temperature of the reaction to room temperature. This
temperature reduction allows hybridization to occur between the deoxyadenosine region on the
capture oligomer and the polydeoxythymidine molecules that are covalently attached to the
magnetic particles. The microparticles, including the captured target molecule bound to them, are
pulled to the side of the reaction vessel using magnets and the supernatant is aspirated. The
particles are washed to remove residual specimen matrix that may contain amplification reaction
inhibitors. After the target capture steps are completed, the specimens are ready for
amplification. Target amplification assays are based on the ability of complementary
oligonucleotide primers to specifically anneal and allow enzymatic amplification of the target
nucleic acid strands. The Hologic TMA reaction replicates a specific region of the 16S rRNA
from GC via DNA intermediates. A unique set of primers is used for the target molecule.
Detection of the rRNA amplification product sequences (amplicon) is achieved using nucleic
acid hybridization. A single-stranded chemiluminescent DNA probe, which is complementary to
a region of the target amplicon, is labeled with an acridinium ester molecule. The labeled DNA
probe combines with amplicon to form stable RNA:DNA hybrids. The Selection Reagent
differentiates hybridized from unhybridized probe, eliminating the generation of signal from
unhybridized probe. During the detection step, light emitted from the labeled RNA:DNA hybrids
is measured as photon signals in a luminometer and are reported as Relative Light Units (RLU).
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Reproducibility Study
Reproducibility study was done using three panels, one negative and two GC positive members.
The positive samples were clinical samples selected based on the RLU values of the result
interpretation range. The reproducibility study was conducted in three sites (2 external and one
internal) on TIGRIS and Panther system by two operators at each site. For each instrument at
each site each operator performed 2 runs per day over 3 days for a total of 12 runs performed
over a period of 6 days. At each of three sites approximately 108 samples were tested on each
instrument. Three hundred twenty-four samples were tested on each instrument across the sites.
The percent agreement with expected results for all panels was 100%. The summary of the
results is shown in Table 1 below.

urine specimen transport tube is stable at 2°C to 30°C for 30 days for testing. If longer
storage is required urine sample in the transport tube can be stored at –20°C to –70°C for 12
months after collection.
7. Detection Limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) was tested and confirmed with dilution panels prepared using
two strains of GC organisms spiked into pooled negative urine. Testing evaluated one
antibiotic susceptible strain, Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 (GP1803), and one
antibiotic resistant stain, Neisseria gonorrhoeae WHO X/NCTC 13820 (GP2730). The
dilution panels were tested on three Panther instruments with two reagent lots. At least 20
replicates were run for each concentration for each reagent lot for each strain. The LoD for
urine specimens, defined as the target concentration that can be detected in 95% of the
replicates tested, was determined to be 0.04933 CFU/mL for ATCC 49226 and 0.03986
CFU/mL for stain X/NCTC 13820.

8. Assay Cut-Off:
Assay test results are automatically interpreted by the Aptima assay software. A test results
may be negative, equivocal, positive, or invalid as determined by the toral RLU in the
detection step as shown in Table 7.
Table 7: Result Interpretation
Test Interpretation Total RLU (x1000)
Negative 0* to < 50
Equivocal 50 to < 100
Low RLU positive 100 to < 2,000
Positive 2,000 to < 12,000
Invalid 0* or > 12,000
*A zero (0 x 1000) RLU result on the run report represents a value between zero and 999 RLU. RLU values less
than 690 on the Panther System will be reported as invalid. 1 In the low positive range, data suggest positive results
should be interpreted carefully, with the understanding that the likelihood of a false positive may be higher than a
true positive.
9. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not Applicable
10. Carry-Over:
A multi-run analytical study was conducted using spiked panels on three Panther systems.
Carryover was assessed using approximately 20% high titer GC samples (>2x 105 cells/mL
or rRNA equivalent) dispersed between negative samples. Testing was carried out using five
(5) runs on each of three Panther systems with a total of 2941 negative samples. The overall
carryover rate was 0.07% with a 95% confidence interval of 0.02-0.25%.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Performance:
Aptima GC clinical performance was evaluated in a clinical comparison study, using fresh
and frozen prospective patient-collected first catch male urine specimens. Overall, 2085
males were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter study. Participants were sexually active
individuals at least 14 years of age, attending one of eleven (11) participating clinical
collection sites, with or without symptoms of an STI infection.

One first-catch urine specimen was collected from each male subject. Four urine samples
were prepared from each first-catch urine specimen to be processed for testing with the
investigational assay and three FDA cleared NAAT comparator assays. Three clinical testing
sites performed Aptima GC testing; all comparator testing was completed at a single central
laboratory. The results of the Aptima GC Assay were compared to a patient infected status
(PIS), based on results from three FDA-cleared NAATs. Specimens were categorized as
infected if a positive result occurred in at least two of the comparator NAATs, and as not
infected if at least two of the comparator results were negative; the third (tiebreaker)
comparator assay was only required if the first two comparator results were discordant.
The calculated performance estimates are shown below.
Among 2085 collected samples, 1958 were evaluable and 127 samples were excluded from
the calculation (12 samples were withdrawn, 50 withdrawn Aptima MU, 13 AGC
missing/final Invalid results, 51 PIS cannot be determined and 1 equivocal by AGC result).
The total invalid rate with Aptima GC assay is 0.6%.
