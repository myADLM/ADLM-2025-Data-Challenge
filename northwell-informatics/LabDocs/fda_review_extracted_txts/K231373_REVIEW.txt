III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes are evacuated, sterile, single use, in vitro
diagnostic medical devices. They are intended to be used by trained healthcare professionals for
the collection, containment, preservation, and transport of human venous blood specimens used
for in vitro diagnostic testing.
BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes are used for Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
testing.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
• Rx - For Prescription Use Only
• In vitro diagnostic use only
• Do not use if foreign matter is present or if tube is damaged.
• Examine tubes prior to use. K2EDTA is visible in the tube and should appear as clear and
colorless dots. K2EDTA spray coated additives may have a white to slightly yellow
appearance; this does not affect the performance of the EDTA additive. Do not use the tube if
the additive is missing, discolored, or if foreign matter or precipitate is present.
• BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes have been validated for use with HbA1c
and hemotology analytes. They have not been evaluated for Chemistry or Molecular testing
in whole blood or plasma.
• Do not use BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes with lavender caps for trace
element testing. Use only BD Vacutainer® Trace Element Tubes with royal blue caps for
trace element testing.
• Samples collected in BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes are known to have
interferences with Magellan Diagnostics LeadCare® assays employing the Anodic Stripping
Voltammetry (ASV) methodology, and should not be used with assays employing ASV
methodology.
• Venous blood gas samples collected with plastic tubes made from polyethylene terephthalate
(PET), including BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA tubes, should not be used when testing
carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). A clinically significant positive bias with COHb results may
occur.
• BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes should not be used to measure divalent
cations (e.g. calcium and magnesium) because the EDTA additive may bind to divalent
cations and may cause interference in their measurement, depending on the test methodology.
• Do not use BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes containing K2EDTA for
potassium measurement.
• Follow your facility’s procedures if clots or other visible obstructions are present in the
sample as this could lead to the inability to test the sample.
• Any change in blood collection tube type, size, handling, processing or storage condition for
a particular laboratory assay should be evaluated by the laboratory for each
instrument/reagent system per the laboratory's standard procedure.
• BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Tubes may contain trace levels of Acetone, tert Butanol,
Ethylbenzene, Hexane, 2 Methylpentane, 3 Methylpentane, and Xylene. It has not been
K231373 - Page 2 of 8

--- Page 3 ---
determined if the presence of trace levels of these compounds will affect test results in
chromatography-based assays.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable. Several FDA cleared test systems with different technologies were used in the
validation studies.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes are plastic, evacuated, sterile, single use, in
vitro diagnostic medical devices. The tube consists of a Vacutainer® Hemogard™ Closure
Assembly, a plastic tube, and EDTA (dipotassium) additive. The EDTA anticoagulant is spray
coated in the dipotassium (K2) form. The EDTA additive prevents specimen coagulation. The
tube closure is lavender color-coded to indicate the presence of the EDTA additive. Tube
stoppers are lubricated with silicone to facilitate stopper insertion. The tubes are available in
13x75mm, 13x100mm and 16x100mm configurations with draw volumes ranging from 2.0 to
10.0 mL. The same BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes for hematology testing
were cleared in K213670.
B Principle of Operation:
The BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes use controlled vacuum to draw a
specific volume of blood into the sterile interior of the tube. The interior of the tube wall is spray
coated with K2EDTA which binds calcium ions thus blocking the coagulation cascade. The
presence of a surfactant is intended to reduce adhesion of red blood cells and fibrin to the tube
walls. The tubes are compatible with BD Vacutainer® Blood Collection Needles, Blood
Collection Sets, Transfer Devices, Holders and Adapters. Once the vein of the patient has been
penetrated using a standard needle, the collection tube is centered in the holder and pushed onto
the needle, puncturing the stopper of the tube. Once the pressure is equalized, the blood flow
ceases and the tube is removed from the needle holder or needle. Immediately after the blood has
been drawn, the tube is gently inverted 8-10 times to mix the blood with the anticoagulant.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
This study was conducted to evaluate the repeatability (within tube) and reproducibility (lot
to lot and tube to tube) of BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes for
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing.
The study included fifty-two participants from clinical settings. Blood was collected from
each subject into six BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes. Specimens were
tested for HbA1c in duplicate per tube with 2 tubes per lot across 3 lots of tubes and 2 tubes
per lot within two hours of collection on two FDA cleared HbA1c test systems with different
technologies. Results are summarized in the table below.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
A. Within-Tube Stability (Analyte stability):
Stability studies were conducted to assess analyte within-tube stability in the BD
Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes. Stability studies were assessed for up
to 24-hour storage at room temperature and 72-hour storage at refrigerated temperatures
(2-8°C) for HbA1c testing. Analyte stability was tested on a FDA cleared instrument
platform. The study protocols and acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be
acceptable. These studies showed that the samples are stable up to 24 hours when stored
at room temperature and 72 hours at 2-8°C.
B. Shelf-Life
Real Time stability testing of the BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood Collection Tubes
showed that the candidate device is stable for 12-16 months when stored at 4 to 25°C.
The stability study protocol and acceptance criteria has been reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The claimed shelf-life of each tube is shown below:
K2EDTA Blood Tube Size Draw Volume Claimed Shelf-life
13x75 2 mL 15 months
13x75 3 mL 16 months
13x75 4 mL 16 months
13x75 4 mL 16 months
13x100 6 mL 15 months
16x100 10 mL 12 months
C. Additional bench testing on the candidate device
Benchtop studies were conducted to assess draw volume, X-value, 2nd stopper pullout,
stopper/shield separation, stopper leakage, tube leakage, breakage resistance during drop

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
A study was conducted to evaluate equivalence between BD Vacutainer® K2 EDTA Blood
Collection Tubes and the cleared comparator tube for Hemoglobin A1c testing.
A total of 209 participants were enrolled in the study. Blood was collected from each
participant into the required study tubes using standard phlebotomy techniques. HbA1c was
evaluated on three FDA cleared test systems and demonstrated comparable results between
the candidate tubes and the comparator tubes. HbA1c testing data was analyzed using
Deming regression. Biases at the MDLs between tube types were estimated with 95%
confidence intervals and determined to be acceptable. Regression analyses for a
representative tube using each instrument platform are provided in the table below:
