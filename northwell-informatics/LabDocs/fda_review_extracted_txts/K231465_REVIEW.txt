insert, and instructions needed to collect, package, and mail the DBS Collection Strips to Qvin
Labs for HbA1c testing using the Q-Pad A1c Test.
Once the DBS Collection Strips are received at Qvin Labs, the Q-Pad A1c Test is performed A
sample is punched and eluted from a strip with the Beckman HbA1c Hemolyzing Reagent, then
tested using FDA-cleared A1c reagents on the Beckman Coulter AU480 Chemistry Analyzer
(k120199) according to the Q-Pad A1c Test laboratory standard operating procedure.
B Principle of Operation:
The Q-Pad Kit contains a menstrual pad that collects menstrual blood onto the DBS Collection
Strip (“Q-Strip”), which can then be shipped to Qvin Labs for testing. The user removes the Q-
Strip from the menstrual pad prior to shipping the sample. Once the dried blood sample is
received by the designated laboratory, a trained professional performs the Q-Pad A1c Test by
taking a circular punch from the strip, which is eluted with Beckman HbA1c Hemolyzing
Reagent (k120199). Once eluted, the sample is assayed using FDA-cleared A1c reagents on the
Beckman Coulter AU480 Chemistry analyzer.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor provided multiple analyses to support the substantial equivalence of their
device. The results from the following studies (except precision/reproducibility and method
comparison) each reflect an assessment of 2-5 aliquots of a single eluent from the test strip.
The sponsor also provided additional assessments that only included a single result from each
test strip as per the Q-Pad A1c Test’s instructions for use.
Menstrual Blood:
Precision was evaluated by testing menstrual blood samples obtained from 3 subjects with
low, medium, and high HbA1c levels. Samples were collected per the Q-Pad Test System’s
instructions for use, following which samples were punched, extracted, and measured on the
Beckman Coulter AU480 Chemistry analyzer at the designated laboratory according to the
Q-Pad A1c Test instructions for use. Samples were run by one operator in duplicate for 5
days and 2 runs per day on one Beckman AU480 analyzer for a total of 60 measurements per
sample. One Q-Pad Kit lot and one reagent lot was used. Results are shown below:
Repeatability Repeatability Total Within-
Mean

High 60 12.35% 0.09 0.72 0.14 1.11 0.20 1.60
Venous Blood:
The sponsor provided a precision study using venous blood, a validated surrogate for the
intended use sample, that measured the imprecision of patient samples and operator-to-
operator variability over a 20-day time period.

The sponsor additionally provided data per CLSI EP35 to support that venous blood samples
did not behave differently from menstrual blood samples.
Inter-strip and Intra-Strip Precision:
Inter-strip and intra-strip precision were each evaluated separately by testing menstrual blood
samples obtained from 9 subjects with varying HbA1c levels (3 subjects <6.5%, 3 subjects
between 6.5-8.5%, and 3 subjects >8.5%). Two Q-Strips were tested per subject for the inter-
strip study, and three punches from a single Q-Strip were tested per subject for the intra-strip
study. The results were as follows:
Mean Repeatability Mean Repeatability
A1c Level %HbA1c (within-strip) %HbA1c (between-strip)
(within-strip) SD* %CV (between-strip) SD %CV
< 6.5% 5.20% 0.49 1.15 5.32% 0.31 0.44
6.5-8.5% 7.29% 1.01 1.75 7.10% 0.21 2.59
> 8.5% 10.11% 0.49 1.08 11.67% 0.39 0.44
Lot-to-Lot Precision
The sponsor evaluated lot-to-lot reproducibility of the Q-Pad Test System through the use of
3 Q-Pad lots in their method comparison study. Samples were collected by users at home and
shipped to the designated laboratory where they were eluted and tested according to the Q-
Pad A1c Test instructions for use. Results from this analysis demonstrate acceptable lot-to-
lot performance.
2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted to evaluate the linear range of HbA1c measurements from
the Q-Pad Test System. Menstrual blood samples collected onto Q-strips were collected at 2
levels, then eluted and mixed to obtain 9 levels: 4.37%, 5.64%, 6.91%, 8.18%, 9.45%,
10.72%, 11.99%, 13.26%, and 14.53% HbA1c. The samples were eluted and measured on
the Beckman Coulter AU480 Chemistry analyzer at the designated laboratory according to
the Q-Pad A1c Test instructions for use, and the results were compared to the expected
values (previously measured values for high and low; calculated values based on dilution
factor for all others). The expected values were plotted versus the observed values. The
results using standard linear regression analysis were as follows:
y = 0.987x - 0.0365; R2 = 0.997
The study supports the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 4.0-15.0%.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
i.) Endogenous and exogenous substances:
Potential interference from endogenous and exogenous substances was evaluated using
menstrual blood samples at four levels of HbA1c (< 5.5%, 5.5-7.0%, 7.1-9.5%, and
≥9.5%). Menstrual blood samples were spiked with potential interferents. After drying,
each sample and un-spiked controls were resuspended from the Q-strips, and %HbA1c
was measured on the Beckman Coulter AU480 Chemistry Analyzer at the designated
laboratory according to the Q-Pad A1c Test instructions for use. Results from the spiked
test samples were compared to the results from the control samples. Significant
interference was defined by the sponsor as greater than ± 10% difference between test
and control results. The highest concentrations at which no significant interference was
observed are summarized below:
Highest Concentration
Substances Without Significant
Interference
Acetaminophen 20 mg/mL
Acetylsalicylic Acid 65 mg/dL
Azo-Standard Phenazopyridine HCL 0.0195 mg/dL
Bilirubin, conjugated 40 mg/dL
Bilirubin, unconjugated 40 mg/dL
Clindamycin 5.1 mg/dL
Glyburide 0.2 mg/dL
Ibuprofen 50 mg/dL
Liraglutide 0.0168 mg/dL
L-Ascorbic Acid 5.25 mg/dL
Metformin 4 mg/dL
Metronidazole 12.3 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 600 IU/mL
Sitagliptin 0.115 mg/dL
Tinidazole 15.3 mg/dL
Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins 1640 mg/dL
ii.) Bodily fluids:
Potential interference from bodily fluids was assessed using the same protocol and
acceptance criteria as described above for the endogenous and exogenous substance
evaluations. Urine (at pH 5.45 and pH 7.5 and urine from people with Type-I and Type-II
diabetes), semen, sweat, and vaginal fluid were applied to the Q-Pad in various amounts
(up to 75%) relative to the amount of menstrual blood (as volume/volume percentage).
Results demonstrated no significant interference of bodily fluids at amounts expected
when samples are collected per the device’s instructions for use; at higher bodily fluid
concentrations, the Beckman Coulter AU480 Chemistry Analyzer identified the sample
as unreadable, and no result was returned.

Samples contaminated with feces or excessive urine are visually recognizable as such,
and the Q-Pad A1c Test includes instructions for laboratory operators to identify and
reject these samples. Additionally, the labeling advises patients to identify and reject their
own samples if they may be saturated with urine.
iii.) Topically applied substances:
Potential interference from substances topically applied to the vaginal area was assessed
using the same protocol and acceptance criteria as described above for the endogenous
and exogenous substance evaluations. Twenty potential interferents were chosen based
on the most commonly used topical products, including a variety of active ingredients,
and were evaluated by applying the amount recommended for use in the respective
product instructions to the Q-Pad after the application of menstrual blood: vaginal
lubricant, vaginal moisturizer, spermicide gel, yeast infection treatment, anti-itch cream,
deodorant spray, feminine powder, feminine wipes, and douche.
No significant interference was observed from any of the products evaluated.
Additionally, the labeling for the home user contains the following statement:
Use of any products such as creams, lubricants, moisturizers, wipes, or deodorants,
in or on your vagina before or during the use of the Q-Pad may cause inaccurate
results. Ensure your intimate area is clean before using the Q-Pad.
iv.) Hemoglobin variants
Potential interference from common hemoglobin variants (HbC, HbD, HbE, HbF, HbS)
was evaluated using validated venous surrogate samples. Fifteen samples with varying
levels of %HbA1c and hemoglobin variants were applied to Q-strips, eluted, and
measured on the Beckman Coulter AU480 Chemistry Analyzer at the designated
laboratory according to the Q-Pad A1c Test instructions for use. Test results were
compared to known %HbA1c values obtained by a commercial reference laboratory. The
sponsor defined significant interference as greater than ±10% difference between the
candidate test result and the known result. The results of the study support the sponsor’s
claim that there is no significant interference from hemoglobin variants HbC, HbD, HbE,
and HbS. Samples containing >10.9% HbF show a significant negative bias with the Q-
Pad A1c Test. The following is a table of samples that were measured:
% Content of Variant
Hemoglobin Variant Range in %HbA1c
in Sample
HbC 31.5-34.4 5.5-7.6
HbD 39.0-39.7 5.1-6.5

http://www.ngsp.org. The Q-Pad A1c Test System is traceable to the International Federation
of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Reference Method for Measurement
of HbA1c.
Sample Stability
Several stability studies using menstrual samples were conducted to assess the performance
of the Q-Pad Test System to collect and measure quality samples after undergoing simulated
extreme shipping and distribution conditions (combinations of extreme cold, extreme heat,
extreme humidities). Study protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The study
results support the sponsor’s claim that the Q-Pad Test System performs as indicated when
collected patient samples are shipped from the site of home collection, in the return sample
container and provided mailing pouch, to the designated laboratory following the provided
instructions.
Q-Pad Stability
Q-Pad stability was assessed using accelerated and real-time stability studies. Stability
protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable. The Q-Pad Kit
labeling includes claims that the Q-Pad is stable for up to 60 days once the pouch is opened
and until the expiration date printed on the packaging when unopened kits are stored between
59-86°F.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted according to the instructions for use for the Q-
Pad Test System. One hundred and ninety-eight (198) patients self-collected menstrual
samples (4.6-14.2% HbA1c) at home using one of three lots of the Q-Pad. Samples were
shipped per the instructions for use, then measured on the Beckman Coulter AU480
Chemistry Analyzer (k120199) at the designated laboratory. HbA1c results obtained with
menstrual blood were compared to results from matched venous blood samples using the
same Beckman Coulter HbA1c reagents. All samples were tested in singlicate.
Study enrollment was as follows:
%HbA1c Interval Total %
< 5.5% 21.7%
5.5-7.0% 29.8%

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Not applicable.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The sponsor performed a reference range study according to CLSI EP28-A3c in which 128
healthy participants self-collected menstrual samples according to the Q-Pad Kit instructions for
use demonstrating a reference interval of 4.0%-6.0% HbA1c.
The sponsor includes the following in the labeling:
In 2023, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended a reasonable A1c goal for
many non-pregnant adults is < 7% (53 mmol/mol) without significant hypoglycemia. On the
basis of health care professional judgment and patient preference, achievement of lower A1c
levels than the goal of 7% may be acceptable and even beneficial if it can be achieved safely
without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Less stringent A1c goals
(such as <8% [64 mmol/mol]) may be appropriate for patients with limited life expectancy or
where the harms of treatment are greater than the benefits. Health care professionals should
consider deintensification of therapy if appropriate to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in patients
with inappropriate stringent A1c targets.1
