IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The TRUENESS and TRUENESS AIR Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems consist of the
TRUENESS or TRUENESS AIR Blood Glucose Meter and the TRUENESS Blood Glucose Test
Strips. The TRUENESS Blood Glucose Control Solutions (level 1 and level 2), and the
TRUEdraw Lancing Device with TRUEPLUS lancets are for use with the system and are sold
separately.
The TRUENESS AIR Blood Glucose Meter and TRUENESS Blood Glucose Meter differ only
in Bluetooth functionality which is present only in the TRUENESS AIR Blood Glucose Meter.
B Principle of Operation:
The TRUENESS and TRUENESS AIR Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems measure the amount
of glucose in whole blood quantitative using fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip and
reports the plasma equivalent glucose results. The glucose measurement is achieved by using an
amperometric detection method that uses glucose dehydrogenase flavin-adenine dinucleotide
(GDH-FAD) based chemistry. When a drop of blood is applied to the test strip it is pulled into
the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with test strip chemistry
generating electrons and producing a current that is proportional to the glucose concentration in
the sample. After the reaction time, the detected current is calculated by the meter and the
resulting glucose concentration is displayed by the meter.

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the glucose measurement was evaluated using venous whole blood spiked
with glucose. Eleven whole blood samples were adjusted to the following glucose
concentrations (as measured by the ABL90 FLEX analyzer as the comparator method): 31.1,
85.9, 149.5, 208.6, 261.9, 315.6, 377.9, 444.6, 502.4, 554.4, and 614.0 mg/dL. The summary
of the linear regression analysis for each lot was as follows:
Test Strip
Slope y-intercept R2 value
Lot #
Lot 1 1.0003 -3.2540 0.9994
Lot 2 1.0026 -3.1289 0.9987
Lot 3 0.9970 -3.7063 0.9991
Combined 0.9999 -3.3630 0.9990
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 40-600
mg/dL. If a sample result is less than 40 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as
“Lo”. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as
“Hi”. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated by the sponsor and were demonstrated to
function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To assess potential interferences, the sponsor used venous whole blood samples adjusted to 3
glucose concentration ranges: 50-70, 110-130, and 225-270 mg/dL. Each of these samples
was divided into a test pool and a control pool, with each of the potential endogenous and
exogenous interfering substances added to the test pool. The % difference between the test
sample and the control sample was calculated using mean of 10 replicates for each of the 3

Method Comparison/Lay User Performance Study
To assess the performance of the TRUENESS AIR Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the
hands of lay users, the sponsor performed a study with 354 lay user participants who
collected and tested their own fingertip capillary blood samples. The glucose concentrations
in the samples ranged from 42-460 mg/dL including 11 native samples < 80 mg/dL and 33
native samples > 250 mg/dL as measured by the laboratory comparator method, the ABL90
Flex Plus (k160153). Results were analyzed by comparing blood glucose results obtained
from the TRUENESS Blood Glucose meter by the lay user against the laboratory comparator
value obtained by healthcare professionals. Results are summarized in the tables below:

Usability:
At the end of the study, each participant was asked to complete a usability questionnaire
regarding ease of understanding of information in the user manual and the ease of use when
performing a blood glucose test. From the sponsor’s analysis of the questionnaire responses,
the participants overall were satisfied with the ease of operation by following the instructions
for use in the User’s Manual and the overall performance of the subject blood glucose
monitoring system.
Labeling Readability
The readability of the over-the counter, home use labeling was evaluated using a Flesch-
Kincaid analysis and demonstrated that the readability grade level scores were less than an
8th grade level.
Extreme Glucose Study
System accuracy at extreme glucose levels was evaluated by measuring 51 samples with
glucose concentrations below 80 mg/dL and 50 samples with glucose concentrations greater
than 250 mg/dL on the TRUENESS AIR Blood Glucose Monitoring System using 3 lots of
test strips. Results on the candidate device were compared to the results obtained using the
comparator method (ABL90 FLEX Plus Analyzer). Results are summarized below:

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit study
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood samples
with hematocrit levels of 15-60% (15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 42, 50, 55 and 60%) at five levels of
glucose (40–50, 51–110, 111– 50, 151– 250, and 251–400 mg/dL). Each sample was tested
in replicates of 10 using 10 meters and three test strip lots. Results from the candidate system
were compared to results obtained using the comparator method (ABL90 FLEX analyzer) a
laboratory-based comparator measurement and to the candidate system results of samples
with normal hematocrit (~42%). The results demonstrated acceptable performance across the
claimed hematocrit range of 15-60%.
2. Altitude Effects
To evaluate the effects of altitude on the TRUENESS AIR Blood Glucose Monitoring
System results, contrived venous whole blood samples were altered to 6 glucose
concentrations (45-55, 76-84, 124-136, 190-210, 338-362, and 507-548 mg/dL) and tested at
10,000 ft feet above sea level. The meter results were compared to those obtained with the
comparator method (ABL90 FLEX analyzer). The results support the labeling claim that the
system functions as intended at altitudes up to an altitude of 10,000 feet.
3. Sample Volume
The sponsor performed a study to support the claimed minimum sample volume of 1.0 μL for
the TRUENESS and TRUENESS AIR Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems. Venous whole
blood samples with three levels of glucose concentrations (approximately 55, 110, 215
mg/dL) were tested at five sample volumes (0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 μL) using 3 lots of the
test strips and 10 meters. Values obtained with the candidate system were compared to those
obtained using the comparator ABL90 FLEX method. The meter has an error message
displayed, E-7, if enough blood is not added to the test strip. The results of the study support
the claimed sample volume of 1.0 μL and that the insufficient sample volume error message
functions as intended.
4. System Operating Conditions Testing
The sponsor performed operating condition studies using venous whole blood samples with 5
glucose levels (40-50, 51-110, 111-114, 151-250, and 280-400 mg/dL) to evaluate
temperatures ranging from 50-104°F (10-40°C) and relative humidity from 10% to 90%.
Candidate system results obtained at the following temperature and humidity combinations
were compared to candidate system results obtained at ambient conditions (23℃/50%RH):
low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low
humidity and high temperature/high humidity. The results support the claims in the labeling
that the system can be used in conditions of 50-104°F (10-40°C) with relative humidity of 10
to 90%.

5. Flex studies
The following additional flex studies were performed with the TRUENESS AIR Blood
Glucose Monitoring System: sample perturbation, intermittent sampling, used test strips,
drop, and shipping testing. The testing performed demonstrated that the device is robust
under these conditions.
6. Electrical Safety and EMC Testing
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed, and the system was found
to be compliant.
7. Infection Control Testing
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the external materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing
laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen
disinfectant, SUPER SANI-CLOTH ® Germicidal Disposable Wipes (EPA Registration
#9480-4). A robustness study was also conducted by the sponsor demonstrating that there
was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 520 cleaning and
disinfection cycles using the SUPER SANI-CLOTH ® Germicidal Disposable Wipes. The
robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient device use. Labeling
was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection
procedures.
8. Glucose test strip lot release
Glucose test strip lot release protocols and criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
