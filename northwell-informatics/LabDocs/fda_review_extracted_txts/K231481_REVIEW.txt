III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test, performed on the GeneXpert Dx and GeneXpert
Infinity Systems, is an automated multiplexed real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) test intended for use in the simultaneous in vitro qualitative detection and
differentiation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A,
influenza B, and/or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swab and
anterior nasal swab specimens collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory
tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection due to SARS-CoV-2,
influenza A, influenza B, and RSV can be similar.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus is intended for use in the differential detection of SARS-
CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and/or RSV RNA and aids in the diagnosis of COVID-19,
influenza and/or RSV infections if used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological
information, and laboratory findings. SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral
RNA are generally detectable in nasopharyngeal swab and anterior nasal swab specimens during
the acute phase of infection.
Positive results are indicative of the presence of the identified virus, but do not rule out bacterial
infection or co-infection with other pathogens not detected by the test. The agent(s) detected by
the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test may not be the definite cause of disease.
Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and/or RSV infection.
The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other
patient management decisions.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
GeneXpert Instrument Systems:
• GeneXpert Dx Systems (GX-I, GX-II, GX-IV, GX-XVI)
• GeneXpert Infinity Systems (Infinity-48s and Infinity-80)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test, performed on the GeneXpert Instrument
(GeneXpert Dx, GeneXpert Infinity-48s and GeneXpert Infinity-80 systems), is a multiplex
nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2,
influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral RNA from NPS and NS swab specimens.
K231481 - Page 2 of 33

--- Page 3 ---
To perform the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test, NPS and NS swab specimens from
patients are collected with nylon flocked swabs and placed into either 3 mL viral transport
medium (VTM) or 2 mL eNAT. With a supplied transfer pipette, eluted NPS and NS swab
specimens are loaded into the sample chamber of a single-use, self-contained Xpert Xpress CoV-
2/Flu/RSV plus cartridge. Each assay cartridge contains separate chambers for sample loading,
sample processing, and target amplification by real-time RT-PCR, and contains all the reagents
necessary to carry out these processes. Because the cartridges are self-contained, and specimens
never contact working parts of the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is
minimized.
The assay cartridge containing the patient sample is inserted into the GeneXpert Instrument
System, which performs fully automated and integrated sample preparation and real-time RT-
PCR for the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test in approximately 36 minutes. The Xpert
Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test can be run in one of five different modes, varying in the
number of target analyte(s) tested for and reported. The five modes are: SARS-CoV-2 only;
SARS-CoV-2 and Flu; SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV; Flu only; or Flu and RSV. For the SARS-CoV-2
only and Flu only modes, there is an option to activate an Early Assay Termination (EAT)
function, which will provide earlier time to results in high titer specimens if the signal from the
target nucleic acid reaches a predetermined threshold before the assay has finished running.
When EAT is activated, the earliest time to a positive result is ~ 25 minutes. The GeneXpert Dx
and Infinity Systems have one to 80 randomly accessible modules that are each capable of
performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR and RT-PCR tests. Each module
contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that
works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an
ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE thermocycler for performing
real-time PCR and RT-PCR detection.
After completion of the test, the assay results are interpreted by the GeneXpert software from
measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms and are shown in the “View
Results” window.
B Principle of Operation:
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test is a nucleic acid-based test using real-time RT-PCR.
After addition of the specimen to the Sample Chamber of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus
test cartridge, the cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert Instrument System platform. The
instrument then performs automated sample processing including RNA extraction, followed by
reverse transcription, amplification, detection, and reporting of results. The results are interpreted
automatically by the GeneXpert System and are shown in the View Results window.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
• GeneXpert Dx Systems: GeneXpert Dx software version 4.7b or higher
• GeneXpert Infinity Systems: Xpertise software version 6.4b or higher
2. Specimen Identification:
To perform a test, the user selects the “Create Test” (Dx Systems) or “Orders” (Infinity
Systems) icon, scans the cartridge barcode, enters the sample ID, or scans the sample ID, and
K231481 - Page 3 of 33

--- Page 4 ---
loads the cartridge into the instrument module that has the green blinking light (for the Dx
Systems) or onto the conveyor belt (for the Infinity Systems) to start the test.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
NPS and NS swab specimens are collected using nylon flocked swabs and eluted into 3 mL
VTM or 2 mL eNAT. At the testing facility, the operator mixes the specimen by rapidly
inverting the specimen transport tube 5 times. A transfer pipette provided with the Xpert
Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus is used to transfer an aliquot of the specimen into the Sample
Chamber of the open test cartridge. After closing the cartridge lid, the operator loads the
cartridge onto the applicable GeneXpert instrument for testing.
4. Calibration:
GeneXpert instruments are calibrated at the factory. Routine calibration of the GeneXpert
Instrument systems may be performed by Cepheid Field Service Engineers during annual
maintenance.
5. Quality Control:
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test includes two internal controls: a sample
processing control (SPC), and a probe check control (PCC).
Sample Processing Control (SPC)
The sample processing control is a non-infectious armored RNA pseudovirus that ensures
adequate lysis of target virus, monitors the presence of PCR inhibitors, and verifies the use of
proper PCR conditions. The SPC should be POSITIVE in a sample that is negative for all
four SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV target analytes, and can be
NEGATIVE or POSITIVE in a sample containing detectable levels of one or more of the
target analytes.
Probe Check Control (PCC)
The probe check control is present to control for sufficient reagent rehydration, PCR tube
filling, probe integrity and dye stability. All assay reagents must be present and intact for the
PCC to pass the validated acceptance criteria. If any of the PCC conditions fail, the result is
reported as an ERROR and the test must be repeated using a new assay cartridge.
External Controls
Optional external quality control materials are available from Zeptometrix. Specifically, the
following external controls may be used with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test:
• External Positive Control: NATtrol Flu/RSV/SARS-CoV-2; Cat # NATFRC-6C-IVD
• External Negative Control: Coxsackievirus A9; Cat # NATCV9-6C-IVD
All external controls must be used in accordance with local, state, and federal accrediting
organizations, as applicable.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a. Within-Laboratory Precision
Within-laboratory precision was evaluated at a single site using the Xpert Xpress CoV-
2/Flu/RSV plus test run on the GeneXpert Infinity System. A total of nine contrived
panels containing known quantities of the target analytes were prepared in simulated
matrix, consisting of 2.5% (w/v) porcine mucin, 1% (v/v) human whole blood in 0.85%
sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in a 1x PBS solution with 15% glycerol, which was
then diluted at a 1:40 ratio to a concentration of 2.5% (v/v) in UTM/VTM. Data
supporting the use of simulated matrix can be found in section VII Performance
Characteristics.B.2.Sample Matrix and Transport Media Equivalency Study, later in
this document. The viral materials used to generate the positive panel members are
denoted in Table 1. The contrived positive panels consisted of single target spiked

samples at low concentrations (~1.5x LoD) and moderate concentrations (~3x LoD)
(Table 2). The study was conducted with one operator and one cartridge lot over the
course of 20 days. Each panel member was tested in duplicate twice per day on 20
different days generating a total of 80 replicates per panel member (1 Site x 1 Operator x
1 Lot x 20 Days x 2 Runs per Day x 2 Replicates per run).

The mean and variability analysis between days, between runs, within runs, and overall
(total) for Ct values is shown in Table 4. Overall %CV was ≤ 4.2%. The greatest source
of variability was from Flu A at ~1.5x LoD (Flu A2 Ct), which had a within-run %CV of
3.9%). Overall variability was low, and the study demonstrates assay variability within an
acceptable range.
b. Reproducibility
A blinded, multi-site reproducibility study was conducted to assess the total variability of
the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test across operators, study sites, testing days,
runs, instruments (GeneXpert Dx and Infinity Systems), and reagent lots.
The same nine contrived panels evaluated in the Within-Laboratory Precision Study (see
Table 2) were also tested in the Reproducibility Study. The study was performed by two
operators at each of three testing sites. At each site three cartridge reagent lots were
evaluated. One site performed testing using the GeneXpert Infinity System, while the
remaining two sites conducted testing with the GeneXpert Dx System. Each panel
member was tested in duplicate twice per day on 6 different days generating a total of
144 replicates per panel member (3 Sites x 2 Operators per site x 3 Lots x 2 Days/Lot x 2
Runs per Day x 2 Replicates per run).
The qualitative (i.e., % agreement with expected results) and quantitative results from the
study are illustrated in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively.

aOne replicate was excluded because it was run on a day when an external positive control produced an
incorrect result but was inadvertently not retested.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test demonstrated 100% agreement with expected
results for all panel members except for the Flu B low positive (98.6%), Flu B moderate
positive (99.3%), and the RSV B low positive (99.3%). A lower percent agreement for low
positive panel members was expected, since the analyte concentration of the panel member
analytes was close to the limit of detection (i.e., ~1.5x LoD), which is expected to yield >95%
detection rate. The results of the study demonstrate acceptable assay reproducibility for the
Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test.

aOne replicate from Site 2 used the reagent lot 102 instead of the intended reagent lot 401. In the analysis,
this replicate was included in the calculation for reagent lot 401.
bNine replicates were excluded due to not having Flu A2 Ct values.
cOne replicate was excluded due to not having a Flu B Ct value; another replicate was excluded because it
was run on a day when an external positive control produced an incorrect result, but the sample was
inadvertently not retested.
The mean and variability analysis between sites, operators, lots, days, runs, within-runs, and
overall (total) for Ct values is shown in Table 6. Overall %CV was ≤ 5.3%. The greatest source
of variability was from the negative samples, which had a within-run %CV of 4.2%. Overall
variability was low, and the study demonstrates assay variability within an acceptable range.

a. Wet-Testing
An analytical reactivity study was conducted to evaluate the ability of the Xpert Xpress
CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test to detect multiple SARS-CoV-2, influenza and RSV strains that
are temporally and geographically diverse. Testing was performed on 102 different
strains (18 SARS-CoV-2, 48 Flu A, 21 Flu B, and 15 RSV) in triplicate using inactivated
strains for SARS-CoV-2 and cultured virus for influenza and RSV, unless noted. Each
strain was spiked into negative simulated matrix at analyte concentrations of ~3x the
LoD. Data supporting the use of simulated matrix can be found in section VII

Study, later in this document. The influenza A testing included 20 A/H1N1 (pre-2009
seasonal and 2009 pandemic) strains, 16 A/H3N2 strains, and 12 avian strains (including
the following 9 subtypes: H5N1, H5N2, H6N2, H7N2, H7N3, H2N2, H7N9, and H9N2).
The 21 Influenza B strains included both the Victoria and Yamagata lineage. The 15 RSV
strains included RSV types A and B.

b. SARS-CoV-2 In silico Analysis
The inclusivity of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test was evaluated using in
silico analyses of assay amplicons in relation to the SARS-CoV-2 sequences available in
the GISAID EpiCoV database as of June 15, 2022. For this analysis, the sequences were
separated into lineages of interest based on the Pango Lineage assigned to each genome
by GISAID, and those with ambiguous nucleotides were removed. BLAST (Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool) was used to compare similarity between the amplicon sequences
and the sequences in GISAID. The inclusivity analyses focused on the combined, non-
ambiguous sequences from variants of concern (VOC) or variants of interest (VOI) that
may have important epidemiological, immunological, or pathogenic properties from a
public health perspective, including Delta, Alpha, Omicron BA.1, Omicron BA.2,
Omicron BA.2.12.1, Omicron BA.3, Omicron BA.4, Omicron BA.5, Eta, Iota, Kappa,
Mu, Lambda, Zeta, and Theta, amongst others.
The evaluation included the following number of sequences per SARS-CoV-2 target:
10,310,839 sequences for the E target, 10,428,014 sequences for the N2 target, and
10,178,602 sequences for the RdRp target. The results of this analysis are shown in
Table 8, stratified by the number of nucleotide mismatches between the amplicon and
evaluated sequences.

Cross-Reactivity/Microbial Interference
a. Wet-Testing
i. Cross-Reactivity
The analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus
test was evaluated by testing a panel of non-targeted microorganisms that may be
found in a respiratory tract clinical specimen. Forty-eight (48) non-target
microorganisms (Table 9) were evaluated in the study. Panels were composed of 1 to
8 different non-target microorganisms spiked into simulated matrix at ≥1x105
TCID /mL (for viruses) and ≥1x106 CFU/mL (for bacteria and fungi), with the
50
following exceptions: A live strain of Lactobacillus reutri was unavailable and
therefore genomic DNA was tested at ≥1x106 copies/mL; similarly, whole, enveloped
human coronavirus HKU1 was unavailable and therefore synthetic RNA was tested at
≥1x106 copies/mL. To evaluate cross-reactivity, each panel was tested in triplicate in
the absence of the target microorganisms. No cross-reactivity was observed at the
concentrations tested.

ii. Microbial Interference
A microbial interference study was conducted to assess potential inhibitory effects of
a select panel of 10 non-target microorganisms (7 viruses and 3 bacteria) that may be
found in a human respiratory specimen (Table 10). Viral strains were tested at ≥
1x105 TCID /mL (unless otherwise noted) and bacteria were tested at 1x106
50
CFU/mL in the presence of one strain each of SARS-CoV-2 (USA/WA/1/2020),
influenza A (A/Idaho/07/2018), influenza B (B/Washington/2/2019), RSV A
(A/Australia/2/61) and RSV B (B/9320/MA/77) spiked individually at 3x LoD in
negative simulated matrix. Data supporting the use of simulated matrix can be found
in section VII Performance Characteristics.B.2.Sample Matrix and Transport
Media Equivalency Study, later in this document. Testing was performed with
replicates of eight for each of the target strain/potentially interfering strain
combinations, and a negative simulated matrix control. Under the conditions of the
study, no inhibitory effects were observed for each of the non-target microorganisms
tested in the presence of the target analytes.

b. In silico
For SARS-CoV-2 in silico analyses, sequences for 45 microorganisms that are closely
related or commonly encountered in a respiratory clinical specimen, were downloaded
from GenBank. These sequences were analyzed with BLAST for homology to the
primer/probe sequences for the SARS-CoV-2 targets included in the assay. For Flu and
RSV in silico analyses, all sequences in GenBank (which encompasses essentially all
species) were downloaded and were evaluated with BLAST for homology to the
primer/probe sequences for the Flu A, Flu B, and RSV targets included in the assay. In
addition to performing homology analyses with primer/probe sequences, homology to the
amplicon was also assessed for SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV. All sequences
were downloaded from GenBank during the week of July 15, 2022.
For the SARS-CoV-2, Flu, and RSV in silico analyses, a non-target microorganism was
determined to have no cross-reactivity when its sequence had <80% homology with all
the assay’s primers and probes When ≥80% homology was identified for a single assay
target primer or probe, an analysis of the remaining target primer/probe sequences was
performed to determine if they exhibited ≥80% homology and thus may generate an

amplicon that could be detected. For the SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV in silico
amplicon analyses, a non-target microorganism was determined to have no cross-
reactivity if the amplicon shared <80% homology to the non-target sequences.
For SARS-CoV-2, the E-gene target forward primer, reverse primer, and probe exhibited
>80% homology to SARS-coronavirus from bats and humans and therefore these
microorganisms may be amplified and detected. None of the remaining evaluated
microorganisms have >80% homology to a SARS-CoV-2 target forward primer, reverse
primer and probe and therefore are not expected to be amplified or detected.
For Flu A, Flu B, and RSV B, there were no sequences from organisms expected to be
found in a human respiratory tract sample for which the forward primer, reverse primer,
and probe all had >80% homology. The RSV A primer and probe oligonucleotides
exhibited >80% homology with two Pangolin RSV A isolates. Therefore, the RSV A
primers and probe may cross-react with Pangolin RSV A if the strain is circulating in a
human population and present in a sample tested with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV
plus test. While there was homology >80% to human genomic DNA, the matches were to
different chromosomal regions, and there were no cases where a forward and revere
primer for a specific target matched to the same human genomic DNA fragment. For Flu
A, Flu B, and RSV B, in silico amplicon analyses produced no matches with >80%
homology.
While no matches of the RSV A amplicon to genomic sequences from non-RSV species
sequences of >80% were observed, the RSV A amplicon shared a 95% identify with two
Pangolin RSV A isolates.

For this study, eight negative replicates were tested per potentially interfering substance to
determine the effects on the performance of the SPC. In addition, eight positive replicates
were tested per substance for one SARS-CoV-2 strain, six influenza strains and four RSV
strains. The panel of positive samples included one SARS-CoV-2 strain (USA-WA1/2020),
two 2009 H1N1 strains (A/California/7/2009 and A/Idaho/07/2018), two influenza A H3N2
strains (A/Hong Kong/45/2019 and A/Victoria/361/2011), two influenza B strains
(B/Wisconsin/10/2016 and B/Washington/2/2019), and four RSV strains (A/2/Australia/61,
A/Long/MD/56, B/9320/MA/77, and B/WA/18537/62) spiked into simulated matrix to an
analyte concentration of 3x LoD. Data supporting the use of simulated matrix can be found in
section VII Performance Characteristics.B.2.Sample Matrix and Transport Media

Competitive Interference
The impact of competitive interference, caused by co-infections with on-target analytes, was
evaluated for the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test by testing contrived samples
consisting of individual SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B or RSV strains at 3x LoD in the presence
of different target strains at high concentrations (>1x105 RNA copies/mL, as determined by
droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)). For this study, competitive interference was assessed using
one strain each of SARS-CoV-2 (USA/WA/1/2020), influenza A (A/Idaho/07/2018),
influenza B (B/Washington/2/2019), RSV A (A/Australia/2/61) and RSV B
(B/9320/MA/77). Testing for each target strain (at low concentration) and each potential
competitive strain (at high concentration) was performed in triplicate. No competitive
interference was observed if all replicates for the low concentration target yielded positive
results. If competitive interference was observed, the concentration of the competing virus
was reduced by 10-fold increments until interference was no longer observed. The on-target
analyte combinations evaluated, and the results of this evaluation are shown in Table 13.

of Flu B at 3x LoD, and at Flu A concentrations >1.7x106 RNA copies/mL inhibited
detection of RSV A at 3x LoD (Table 13). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations above
1x105 RNA copies/mL inhibited detection of Flu B at 3x LoD (Table 13). No other
competitive interference was observed for the potential co-infections evaluated in the study,
at the concentrations tested.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a. Controls
External Control Evaluation
Two Zeptometrix NATtrol Molecular Controls, comprised of inactivated viruses in a
purified protein matrix, were evaluated as external controls with the Xpert Xpress CoV-
2/Flu/RSV plus test. Testing was performed with 20 replicates of three separate lots of
the NATtrol SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV Positive Control (cat# NATFRC-6C-IVD) and the
NATtrol SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV Negative Control (cat# NATCV9-6C-IVD) totaling 120
runs. All 120 runs provided valid and accurate results except for the following: A single
Positive Control replicate was negative for Flu B and RSV.
b. Sample Stability
Room Temperature (15 to 30℃) and Refrigerated (2 to 8℃) Stability Studies
A stability study was conducted to establish transport and storage claims for eluted NPS
specimens to be analyzed with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test. Specimens
included one SARS-CoV-2 strain (USA-WA1/2020), one influenza A strain
(A/Idaho/07/2018), one influenza B strain (B/Washington/2/2019), and one RSV strain
(RSV A/2/Australia/61) prepared in clinical NPS-UTM matrix and clinical NPS-eNAT
matrix at a concentration of 3x LoD. Eight replicates of each of the positive specimens
were tested at T0 (fresh) and at multiple time points following storage at 2°C, 8°C, 15°C,
and 30°C. Negative samples were also included and tested in four replicates for each
storage condition and temperature. Under the conditions of the study, all positive and
negative specimens at all storage conditions and temperatures tested were correctly
identified using the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus. The study data supports the
following specimen stability claims:
• VTM and eNAT: room temp (15-30°C) for up to 48 hours
• For VTM: refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to seven days
• eNAT: refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to six days
Freeze/Thaw Testing for Samples Frozen at -20°C or -80°C in VTM or eNAT
The performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test with fresh and frozen
specimens was evaluated for equivalency by testing co-spiked samples containing one
SARS-CoV-2 strain (USA-WA1/2020), one influenza A strain (A/Idaho/07/2018), one
influenza B strain (B/Washington/2/2019), and one RSV strain (RSV B/9320/MA/77)
prepared in pooled negative clinical NPS-VTM matrix and pooled negative clinical NPS-
eNAT matrix at a concentration of <1x LoD, 2x LoD, and 5x LoD. Negative samples
were also included and consisted of negative clinical NPS-VTM and negative clinical
NPS-eNAT matrix.
Positive samples spiked at <1x LoD, 5x LoD, and negative samples were tested in
replicates of 10 per condition, while positive samples prepared at 2x were tested in
replicates of 30 per condition. All positive and negative samples were tested under three
conditions: fresh, after one freeze-thaw cycle, and after two freeze-thaw cycles. For each
freeze-thaw cycle, the samples were placed at either -20°C or -80°C for 24 hours after
K231481 - Page 23 of 33

--- Page 24 ---
which they were thawed on ice prior to analysis with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV
plus test.
For storage at -20°C under all conditions, all replicates for samples spiked at 2x and 5x
LoD were positive, except for the following: one fresh sample spiked at 2x LoD in VTM
was negative for Flu A, while a different fresh sample spiked at 2x LoD in VTM was
negative for RSV. All negative samples were negative for all conditions tested. As
expected, detection varied for samples spiked at <1x LoD.
For storage at -80°C under all conditions, all samples spiked at 2x and 5x LoD were
positive, while all negative samples were negative. As expected, detection varied for
samples spiked at <1x LoD.
The data from this study supports that NPS and NS samples collected in VTM and eNAT
can undergo up to 1 freeze/thaw cycle when stored at -20°C or -80°C.
c. Kit Stability
Real-time kit stability data for the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test is currently
available for eight months at the extremes of the recommended storage temperature range
of 2°C to 28°C. Results to date show that average Ct values from the stability testing
meet the pre-defined performance criteria. Testing is ongoing for up to 37 months on
seven cartridge lots.
d. Cartridge Hold Time
Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus samples that are prepared for testing may wait up to
four and a half hours on the GeneXpert Infinity Instruments before a module becomes
available. During this wait time, targeted viral RNA may degrade or become unstable
such that an originally low positive sample is rendered “NEGATIVE.” Assay
performance out to five and a half hours was evaluated under three storage conditions
(ambient, 25°C/75% relative humidity (RH), and 35°C) with a single lot of the Xpert
Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test. Testing was performed on eight replicates each of one
SARS-CoV-2 strain (USA-WA1/2020), one influenza A strain (A/Idaho/07/2018), one
influenza B strain (B/Washington/2/2019), and one RSV strain (RSV A/2/Australia/61)
spiked into negative simulated NPS matrix at an analyte concentration of 3x LoD.
Negative specimens consisting of simulated NPS matrix were also included in the study.
For negative specimens, eight replicates were collected for each condition and time point.
The results of this study support a cartridge hold time of 4.5 hours.
6. Detection Limit:
The LoD of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test was established using the WHO
International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 (NIBSC, 20/146), 1 inactivated SARS-CoV-2 strain
(USA-WA1/2020), and viral cultures of two Flu A H1 strains, 2 Flu A H3 strains, 2 Flu B
strains (One Yamagata and one Victoria lineage), 2 RSV A strains, and 2 RSV B strains
diluted into pooled negative clinical NPS matrix and negative clinical NS matrix. The LoD is
defined as the lowest concentration for each strain at which 95% (19/20) of replicates yield a
positive result.
Each virus strain was initially tested in a range finding study at >5 concentrations in
replicates of 20 per concentration of virus. Range finding was performed with two cartridge
K231481 - Page 24 of 33

--- Page 25 ---
lots for each virus/strain. Probit analysis was performed on the range finding results to
estimate the LoDs, and the estimated LoDs were subsequently confirmed using two lots of
Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus cartridges. For the confirmatory study, testing was also
performed in replicates of 20 per concentration of virus. The highest (least sensitive) LoD
value for the two lots evaluated in the confirmatory story was reported as the final LoD for
the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test (see Table 14). The LoD for co-analyte spiked
samples was also evaluated and shown to be equivalent to single analyte spiked samples.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test includes defined Ct value cutoffs for each of the
viral targets as well as the SPC. These values were determined during pre-clinical testing and
were subsequently confirmed in the clinical study. The Ct cutoffs are included as automatic
calculations in the assay definition file (ADF) of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not Applicable.
9. Carry-Over:
A study was conducted to assess whether the single-use, self-contained Xpert Xpress CoV-
2/Flu/RSV plus cartridge prevents specimen and amplicon carryover by testing a negative
sample immediately after testing of a high positive sample in the same GeneXpert module.
The negative sample used in this study consisted of simulated NPS/NS matrix and the
positive sample consisted of Flu B and SARS-CoV-2 spiked at high concentrations (i.e., Flu
B/Wisconsin/10/2016 was spiked at 1.0x106 TCID /mL and SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020
50
at 1x104 copies/mL) into simulated NPS/NS matrix. The negative sample was tested in a
GeneXpert module at the start of the study. Following the initial testing of the negative
sample, the high positive sample was processed in the same GeneXpert module followed by
another negative sample. This was repeated 20 times in the same module, resulting in 20
positives and 21 negatives for the module. The study was repeated using a second GeneXpert
module for a total of 40 positive and 42 negative samples. All positive samples were
correctly reported as positive, and all negative samples were correctly reported as negative.
No specimen or amplicon carry-over contamination was observed.

human whole blood in 0.85% sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1x PBS solution with
15% glycerol and diluted into UTM/VTM at a 1:40 ratio. For this study, one SARS-CoV-2
strain (USA-WA1/2020), one influenza A strain (A/Idaho/07/2018), one Flu B strain
(B/Wisconsin/10/2016) and two RSV strains (RSV A/2/Australia/61 and RSV
B/9320/MA/77) were seeded into pooled negative matrices or simulated matrices at <1x
LoD, 1.5x LoD, 5x LoD, and 10x LoD. Aliquots of negative matrices were also included in
the evaluation. Positive samples spiked at <1x LoD, 5x LoD, 10x LoD and negative samples
were tested in replicates of 10 per condition, while positive samples prepared at 1.5x LoD
were tested in replicates of 30 per condition
For the conditions outlined in (a), all replicates for all samples spiked at 1.5x, 5x, and 10x
LoD were positive for all evaluated matrices. All negative samples were negative for all
matrices. As expected, detection varied for samples spiked at <1x LoD.
For the conditions outlined in (b), all replicates for all samples spiked at 1.5x, 5x, and 10x
LoD were positive for all evaluated matrices. All negative samples were negative for all
matrices. As expected, detection varied for samples spiked at <1x LoD.
The results for the conditions evaluated in (a) indicate that performance of the Xpert Xpress
CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test is equivalent with viruses seeded into clinical NPS matrix (in
UTM/VTM), clinical NS matrix (in UTM/VTM), and simulated NPS/NS matrix in
UTM/VTM and thus support use of simulated matrix in select analytical validation studies.
The results for the conditions evaluated in (b) reveal that performance of the Xpert Xpress
CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test is equivalent with viruses seeded into clinical NPS matrix (in
UTM/VTM) and clinical NPS matrix in eNAT.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Prospective Study
The clinical performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus was established in a
multi-center study conducted with nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and anterior nasal swab (NS)
specimens in VTM/UTM collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory

infection. Specimens were prospectively collected (i.e., all comers between two time points
that met the clinical study inclusion criteria) during portions of the 2021-2022 viral
respiratory illness season. Due to low prevalence of Flu and RSV during the 2021-2022 viral
respiratory illness season, archived prospectively collected specimens collected during the
2016-2017 influenza season were also enrolled. Specimens prospectively collected in 2022
were tested fresh (Category I) or after freezing (Category II). All specimens enrolled in 2016-
2017 were Category II. In total, thirty-three (33) diverse clinical sites in the U.S. were
involved in the prospective studies. Of these 33 sites, 5 sites participated in specimen
collection only, 27 performed Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus testing and 1 site
performed Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus testing, in addition to comparator and
discordant analysis testing.
A total of 6,987 NPS and NS specimens were enrolled in the study. Of these, 6,100
specimens were enrolled in 2022 while the remaining 897 were collected in 2016-2017. Of
the 6987 specimens, 19 were found to be ineligible after enrollment, 841 were excluded due
to protocol deviations (e.g., specimen mislabeled, specimen not stored appropriately, etc.),
and 6 were excluded because Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test and/or comparator
results were not provided by the testing sites. This left 6121 specimens for evaluation, of
which 5331 (2672 NPS and 2659 NS) were collected in 2022 and 790 (422 NPS and 368 NS)
were collected in 2016-2017. Patient demographic information for all evaluable specimens
collected in 2022 and 2016-2017 is presented in Table 15.

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 performance by
comparing to a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel that includes SARS-CoV-2.
For SARS-CoV-2 performance evaluations, only specimens collected in 2022 were
evaluated, as specimens collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., 2016-2017) were
assumed to be SARS-CoV-2 negative. Of the 5331 evaluable specimens collected in 2022
and evaluated for investigational device SARS-CoV-2 performance, 261 were excluded due
to non-evaluable/invalid comparator tests results, while an additional 19 were excluded
because they were non-determinate (ND) upon retest. This left 5051 specimens (2536 NPS
and 2515 NS) with valid Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test and comparator SARS-
CoV-2 results. Of the 2536 NPS specimens, 98.8% (2505/2536) were tested fresh, while
1.2% (31/2536) were tested frozen with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus. Of the 2515
NS specimens, 99.0% (2489/2515) were tested fresh, while 1.0% (26/2515) were tested
frozen with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test was evaluated for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV
performance by comparing to a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular Flu A/B/RSV assay. For Flu
and RSV performance calculations, specimens collected in both 2022 and 2016-2017 were
evaluated. Of the 6,121 evaluable specimens collected during these time periods and
evaluated for investigational device Flu and RSV performance, 142 were excluded due to
non-evaluable/invalid comparator results, while an additional 25 were excluded because they
yielded ND results upon retest. This left 5954 specimens (3011 NPS and 2943 NS) with valid
Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test and comparator Flu A, Flu B, and RSV results. Of the
3011 NPS specimens, 85.1% (2562/3011) were tested fresh, while 14.9% (449/3011) were
tested frozen with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus. Of the 2943 NS specimens, 86.7%
(2553/2943) were tested fresh, while 13.3% (390/2943) were tested frozen with the Xpert
Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test ND rate for specimens collected in 2022 and
2016-2017, combined, was initially 2.4% (148/6121) and decreased to 0.4% (25/6121) upon
retest. For specimens collected in 2022, the ND was rate initially 2.5% (132/5331) and
decreased to 0.4% (19/5331) upon retest. For specimens collected in 2016-2017, the ND rate
was initially 2.0% (16/790) and decreased to 0.8% (6/790) upon retest.
A summary of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test prospective clinical study
performance is provided in Table 16 for NPS specimens and Table 17 for NS specimens.
Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was calculated as 100% × (TP / (TP + FN)). True positive
(TP) indicates that both the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and the comparator method
had a positive result for the specific analyte, and false negative (FN) indicates that the Xpert
Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus was negative while the comparator result was positive. Negative
Percent Agreement (NPA) was calculated as 100% × (TN / (TN + FP)). True negative (TN)
indicates that both the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and the comparator method had
negative results, and false positive (FP) indicates that the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus
was positive while the comparator result was negative. Specimens that obtained discordant
SARS-CoV-2 results underwent additional testing with a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2
molecular test, while specimens that obtained discordant Flu A, Flu B, or RSV results
underwent additional testing with a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel.

The number of specimens with positive results for more than one or more target analyte by
the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and/or comparator assay(s) is presented in Table 18
and Table 19, where bolded values indicate concordant results. As shown in Table 18, a total
of 4921 specimens collected in 2022 yielded valid results for all four targets for both the
Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and comparator assays. Note that Flu B is not presented
in Table 18, as no Flu B positives were obtained during the 2022 study. The rate of co-
infection for Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus was 0.3% (3/1200) and the rate of co-
infection by the comparators was 0.3% (3/1154). In total, 4 co-infections were detected by
either the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test or the comparator assays for specimens
collected in 2022. Two (2) of these co-infections were discordant between the Xpert Xpress
CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and the comparator assays (see Table 18).

valid results for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV by both the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and
comparator assay. The co-infection rate for Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus was 1.7%
(11/652) and the co-infection rate by the comparator was 1.1% (7/623). In total, 13 co-
infections were detected by either the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test or the
comparator assay, of which 8 were discordant (see Table 19).
