Materials Required but not Provided:
• VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Signal Reagent
• VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Universal Wash Reagent
• VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products High Sample Diluent B
• Quality control materials
• VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Reagent Pack Storage Box (optional) with
desiccant
The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack has been modified from the
previously cleared assay which is susceptible to interference from biotin. The modification was
made to allow the biotinylated antibody capture conjugate to be pre-bound to the well, which
eliminates the risk of biotin interference.
B Principle of Operation:
An immunometric immunoassay technique is used. CEA present in the sample reacts with a
biotinylated antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-CEA) bound to streptavidin on a microwell. In the
next step, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti-
CEA) binds to the immobilized CEA. Unbound materials are removed by washing. The bound
HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic
substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the
wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative,
producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light
produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The amount of
HRP conjugate bound and light produced is directly proportional to the concentration of CEA
present in the sample.

VII Performance Characteristics:
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack was evaluated
by testing a panel of four serum sample pools on one VITROS 5600 System using three
reagent lots. The CEA concentration of the samples were at 6.44, 40.8, 223 and 381 ng/mL.
Testing was performed with two replicates per run, two runs per day over 20 days, yielding a
total of 80 measurements for each reagent lot. Imprecision was calculated by combining the
data for three reagent lots (N=240 datapoint per sample) and the results are summarized in
the table below:

2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated per CLSI EP06, 2nd edition. A low pool of CEA stripped human
serum sample and a high pool (CEA high patient sample), with a target dose above the top
end of the measuring interval of 400 ng/mL, were mixed to create 13 levels ranging from

0.22 to 499.6 ng/mL. Each sample was tested in five replicates using one lot of the modified
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack on one VITROS 5600 System. For
each level, the mean of the measured values, predicted value and the deviation from linearity
were calculated. Predicted values were calculated using a best fitted straight line by a
weighted least squares linear regression analysis. Percent deviations from linearity were
calculated as differences between the observed values (mean values) and the predicted values
divided by the predicted values. The study results are summarized in the following table:
Dilution Range % Deviation from
Slope Intercept R2
(ng/mL) Linearity
0.22 to 499.6 1.043 -0.067 0.999 -4.4% – 4.5%
Linearity was demonstrated from 0.22 ng/mL to 499.6 ng/mL with deviations from linearity
within ±10%. The results support the linearity of the claimed analytical measuring range
(AMR): 0.31 – 400 ng/mL.
Dilution Study:
To assess the automated dilution feature, samples were prepared with CEA concentrations
targeted at 12,000 ng/mL, 18,000 ng/mL, 24,000 ng/mL, 30,000 ng/mL, 38,000 ng/mL,
55,000 ng/mL, and 75,000 ng/mL by spiking recombinant CEA analyte into seven unique
native human serum samples. These samples were tested in duplicate using one lot of each
predicate device and the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack
using the automatic 1:100 dilution performed by the analyzer. The 55,000 ng/mL and 75,000
ng/mL samples were diluted 1:5 manually before being further diluted 1:100 by the analyzer.
The value of each sample obtained from the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products
CEA Reagent Pack was compared to the expected value and percent recovery was calculated.
The results support an automatic sample dilution of 1:100 for the modified VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack.
Hook Effect
The hook effect was assessed using a high dose hook panel that was prepared with VITROS
high sample diluent (HSDB) (containing no measurable CEA) spiked with endogenous CEA
antigen to produce a sample with a concentration of approximately 546,000 ng/mL. This
sample was diluted with VITROS HSDB to produce a set of 10 samples (the High Dose
Hook Panel) with concentrations spanning between 273 and 546,000 ng/mL. Samples were
tested in singlicate using the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent
Pack on one VITROS 5600 System. The claim for the hook effect for the modified VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent is up to 80,000 ng/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference:
Potential interfering substances were tested for their ability to interfere with the modified
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack using procedures recommended in
the CLSI EP07-A3. Each potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substance was

tested at two analyte concentrations: 3 ng/mL and 15 ng/mL. Test samples were spiked with
the test substance and results were compared to matched control samples spiked with an
equal volume of solvent (blank). The CEA in the test samples and control samples were
measured in five replicates using each of three reagent lots on the modified VITROS
Integrated 5600 System. The recovery was calculated by comparing measurements of the test
and control samples. No interference (≤ ±10% difference of test from control) for the
modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack was seen, up to the
concentrations of the potential interfering substances tested as shown in the tables below.

sample containing no CEA and testing in three lots of reagent. No cross-reactivity was
detected.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay measuring interval for the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA
Reagent Pack is the same as the claimed analytical measuring range of the predicate: 0.31 –
400 ng/mL. The instrument has a 1:100 auto-dilution feature for the device. The claimed
extended measuring range is from 400 ng/mL to 40,000 ng/mL. Samples with concentrations
above 40,000 ng/mL will be reported as > 40,000 ng/mL.
The reportable range of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack is 0.31
– 40,000 ng/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The calibration of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack is traceable
to NIBSC First International Reference Preparation 72/225.
Stability:
Long term stability and on-board storage performance was evaluated consistent with methods
based on CLSI EP25-A.
Shelf-life (Long Term) of the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent
Pack was evaluated by using three lots of reagents stored at 2–8°C. At each monthly interval,
three serum samples with CEA concentrations of 5, 20 and 250 ng/mL were tested in four
runs on each of three lots. The data of each sample at each testing time point were compared
to the data of initial value tested at T0. The data support a shelf-life of the modified VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack up to 52 weeks when stored at 2–8°C.
On-board stability of the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack
was evaluated using three lots of Reagent Packs and Calibrators that were stored opened on
the instrument for up to 12 weeks. Four runs were performed by testing Calibrators and QC
In-house Controls on each lot at each time point for fresh and open. The results support the
claim of 8 weeks on-board stability.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack were verified based on the CLSI
EP17-A2 guideline.
The LoB was determined by testing four analyte stripped serum sample pools with three
reagent lots. For each lot, samples were tested two replicates per run, two runs per day over
five test days, resulting a total of 80 datapoints per lot. LoB was defined as the value
K231517 - Page 8 of 11

--- Page 9 ---
corresponding to the 95th percentile of the rank position of the distribution of values. The
highest LoB value observed across three reagent lots was 0.08 ng/mL.
The LoD was determined by testing five samples containing CEA at one to five times the
LoB concentration with three reagent lots. For each lot, the samples were run in six replicates
per run, two runs per day, for five days, yielding a total of 300 datapoints per lot. The LoD
was calculated using a parametric approach. The highest LoD value observed across lots was
0.15 ng/mL. The claimed LoD is 0.31 ng/mL.
The LoQ was determined based on the data from the LoD study described above, using
precision profile approach, with goal of precision of 20% CV. The highest LoQ value
observed across lots was 0.15 ng/mL. The result supports the claimed LoQ as 0.31 ng/mL.

To verify the expected results, serum samples from a total 68 healthy nonsmokers and 72 healthy
smokers were tested in singlicate, on the VITROS 5600 System, using one lot of the modified
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack (candidate device), according to CLSI
EP28-A3c. The results are summarized in the following table:
Percent (%)
Category N 0–3.0 >3.0–5.0 >5.0–10.0
>10.0 ng/mL
ng/mL ng/mL ng/mL
Healthy Subjects
Nonsmokers 68 89.7 7.4 2.9 0
Smokers 72 72.2 22.2 5.6 0
The results verified the reference range established previously.
The labeling of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CEA Reagent Pack includes the
following expected values for CEA among healthy subjects and diseased patients.
