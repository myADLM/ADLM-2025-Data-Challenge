CA 19-9 test results should be used in conjunction with all other available clinical and laboratory
data before a medical decision is determined.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
The package insert of the devices contains the caution statement: “Different test methods cannot
be used interchangeably. 1116-NS‑19‑9 defined antigen in a given patient sample determined
with different tests and from different manufacturers can vary due to differences in test methods
and reagent specificity. A change to the test used during serial monitoring of a patient should be
accompanied by additional sequential testing to confirm baseline values. The results reported by
the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the CA 19‑9 test used.”

2) Calibrators:
• 1 set of VITROS CA19-9 Calibrators 1, 2, and 3 with nominal values of 15 U, 60 U and
700 U 1116-NS‑19‑9 defined antigen/mL; Ready to use
• Lot calibration card
• Protocol card
• 24 calibrator bar code labels (8 for each calibrator)
Materials Required but not Provided:
• VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Signal Reagent
• VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Universal Wash Reagent
• VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products High Sample Diluent B
• Quality control materials
• VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Reagent Pack Storage Box (optional) with

The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 19-9 Reagent Pack has been modified from the
previously cleared assay which is susceptible to interference from biotin. The modification was
made to allow the biotinylated antibody capture conjugate to be pre-bound to the well, which
eliminates the risk of biotin interference.
B Principle of Operation:
When the analyte (1116-NS-19-9 defined antigen) is present in the patient sample, it binds to
streptavidin/biotinylated Antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-1116-NS-19-9 defined antigen) that
is coated to the microwell. In the next step, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled antibody
conjugate (Mouse monoclonal anti-1116-NS-19-9 defined antigen) binds to the immobilized
1116-NS-19-9 defined antigen. Unbound materials are removed by washing.
The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing
luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is
added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol
derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the
level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The
amount of conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of 1116-NS-19-9 defined
antigen present in the sample.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was performed according to CLSI EP06-A2. One pool of human sera with
CA 19-9 concentration above 1000 U/mL was mixed with a low serum pool at around 0.9
U/mL to produce a series of 16 dilution samples. Each dilution sample was tested in five
replicates on one VITROS 5600 Integrated System using one reagent lot of the VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products CA 19-9 Reagent Pack. The data was analyzed using weighted
least squares linear regression analysis comparing measured results to the predicate results.
The results are summarized in the tables below:
Range Slope Y-Intercept % Deviation from
R2
(U/mL) (95% CI) (U/mL) (95% CI) Linearity
0.973 0.145
0.9 – 1152 0.999 -12.3% – 14.1%*
(0.957; 0.989) (0.103; 0.186)
* Sample at 0.86 U/mL showed %Deviation of -12.3%, Sample at 1.52 U/mL showed
%deviation of 14.1%, sample at 2.35 U/mL showed % deviation of 13.0%.
%Deviation is less than 10% for the rest of samples.
The results support the linearity of the following claimed analytical measuring interval
(AMI): 1.4 – 1000 U/mL.
Dilution study:
For automatic dilution, six native samples were diluted on the VITROS 5600 Integrated
System using VITROS High Sample Diluent B Reagent Pack. Six samples were at
concentrations 1310 U/mL, 1810 U/mL, 2050 U/mL, 2780 U/mL, 5000 U/mL, and 9530
U/mL. Each sample was diluted 20-fold (1-part sample to 19-parts diluent) and run in five
replicates, on one reagent lot of the updated VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 19-9
Reagent Pack and one lot of the predicate using one VITROS 5600 Integrated System. The
percent recovery results on the updated reagent lot were compared to the percent recoveries
obtained on the predicate lot. The results support an automatic sample dilution ratio of 20-
fold for the updated VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 19-9 Reagent Pack.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Potential interfering substances were tested for their ability to interfere with the performance
of the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 19-9 Reagent Pack using
procedures recommended in the guidelines CLSI EP07-A3 and CLSI EP37.

data support an on-board stability of the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA
19-9 Reagent Pack up to 8 weeks.
The sample stability and calibrator stability were previously established per K052889.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 19-9 Reagent Pack were verified based on the
CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
The LoB was determined by testing four unique native serum pools containing no
measurable CA 19-9 using three reagent lots. For each lot, samples were run in two replicates
per run, two runs per day, for five days yielding a total of 80 replicates per lot. LoB was
defined as the value corresponding to the 95th percentile of the rank position of the
distribution of values. The highest LoB value observed across three reagent lots was 0.0
U/mL. No claim is shown in the device’s labeling.
The LoD was determined by testing five samples containing low levels of CA 19-9 (three
low native serum sample pools and two low level samples prepared by stripping high level
sample to the target levels) using three reagent lots. For each lot, the samples were run in six
replicates per run, two runs per day for five days yielding a total of 300 replicates per lot. The
LoD was calculated using a parametric approach. The highest LoD value observed across lots
was 0.17 U/mL. The claimed LoD is 1.4 U/mL.
The LoQ was determined based on the study data from the LoD study described above using
precision profile approach with goal of precision of 20% CV. The highest LoQ value
observed across lots was 0.53 U/mL. The results support the claimed LoQ as 1.4 U/mL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were conducted by testing 149 serum native samples in singlicate
using one reagent lot of the modified VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products CA 19-9 Reagent
Pack (candidate device) and two reagent lots of the unmodified VITROS CA 19-9 (predicate
device) on one VITROS 5600 System. The results of samples tested within the analytical
measuring range of both the candidate and the predicate device were performed with
weighted Deming regression analysis by comparing the data from the modified (y) to the
unmodified (x) devices. The results are summarized in the following table:

2. Matrix Comparison:
A study was performed per CLSI EP35 to demonstrate that lithium heparin plasma and
EDTA plasma matrices yield comparable values as serum on the modified VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products CA 19-9 Reagent Pack. A total of 45 matched individual donor
samples with analyte concentration across the analytical measuring range were tested in
singlicate using one reagent lot on one VITROS 5600 Integrated System. Four samples were
excluded from the data analysis due to being outside of measuring range. Weighted Deming
regression analysis was performed by comparing the data from plasma samples (y) to the
matched serum samples (x). The results are summarized in the table below:
