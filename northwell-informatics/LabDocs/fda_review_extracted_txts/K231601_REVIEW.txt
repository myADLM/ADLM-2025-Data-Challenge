B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as intended use
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Warning: The result of the FLC Kappa in a given specimen determined with assays and/or
instrument platforms from different manufacturers can vary due to differences in assay methods
and reagent specificity. The results reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the
identity of the assay used. Values obtained with different assay methods cannot be used
interchangeably. If, in the course of serially monitoring a patient, the assay method used for
determining the FLC Kappa level is changed, additional sequential testing should be carried out.
Prior to changing assays, the laboratory MUST confirm baseline values for patients being serially
monitored.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
This is a manual ELISA and there are no special instrument requirements.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The FLC Kappa is comprised of the following reagents:
• Kappa microplate: coated with polyclonal rabbit anti-human kappa FLC antibody
• Dilution Buffer
• Wash Solution
• Anti-Kappa Antiserum
• Stop Solution
K231601 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
• Calibrators: A five level set in liquid form with target concentrations: 2.7 mg/L, 5.3 mg/L
16 mg/L, 48 mg/L and 96 mg/L, ready to use.
The FLC Lambda is comprised of the following reagents:
• Lambda Microplate: coated with polyclonal rabbit anti-human lambda FLC antibody
• Dilution Buffer
• Wash Solution
• Anti-Lambda Antiserum
• Stop Solution
• Calibrators: A five level set in liquid form with target concentrations: 2.9 mg/L, 5.9 mg/L,
17.7 mg/L, 53.0 mg/L and 106.0 mg/L, ready to use.
The following materials are required but not provided in the kits:
• Densitometer for microplate reading by absorbance spectrophotometry at 450 nm.
• FLC Control Level 1 with target concentrations for Kappa: 9–25 mg/L and Lambda: 15–
30 mg/L
• FLC Control Level 2 with target concentrations for Kappa and Lambda > 35 mg/L
FLC Control Level 1 and FLC Control Level 2 are intended for the quality control of SEBIA
immunoenzymatic procedures and are obtained from a pool of human sera. The controls are
packaged in a stabilized lyophilized form. It must be noted that the high limit of the FLC Control
Level 2 must not exceed the values of the Calibrator 5. Additionally, the exact concentrations for
FLC Control Level 1 and FLC control Level 2 are lot dependent.
B Principle of Operation:
The FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda assays are intended for the quantification of FLCs in human
serum from adults with an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) procedure utilizing
specific anti-Kappa and anti-Lambda FLC antibodies. Kappa FLC or Lambda FLC in the sample
binds to specific anti-Kappa FLC antibody or anti-Lambda FLC antibody coated on the wells of
microplates. Following the washing step, the samples in wells are incubated with an anti-FLC
antiserum (Kit specific) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed by another washing of
wells to remove the excess of the conjugated antiserum. Reading of the optical density is
performed by absorbance spectrophotometry at 450 nm of the colored product. Finally, the
calculation of the FLC concentration of the sample is performed using a calibration curve
obtained with calibrators that have been analyzed on the same microplate.

Traceability:
Refer to K210623
Stability:
Reagent Kit
a. Shelf-life stability: The real-time shelf-life stability of the FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda
reagent kits was determined over a 13-month period using three reagent lots of each assay.
Each reagent lot stored at 2–8oC was tested at 0 (T0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9,10, 12 and 13 months.
At each testing point, three serum samples (low, medium, and high concentration) as well
as two controls (FLC Control Level 1 and FLC Control Level 2) were tested in triplicates
using all three reagent lots of FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda, respectively. At each time
point, the mean concentrations for Kappa and Lambda were compared to the initial target
range concentration obtained at T0. The results are acceptable at all tested time points and
hence support the shelf-life of FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda for 12 months at 2–8oC.
b. Open-vial stability: Refer to K210623
FLC Controls
a. Shelf-life stability: The real-time stability of the FLC Control Level 1 and FLC Control
Level 2 was determined over a three-year period using three lots. Each freeze-dried
control stored at 2–8oC was tested at 0 (T0), 12, 24 and 36 months. At each testing point,
FLC Control Level 1 and FLC Control Level 2 were tested in triplicates using FLC Kappa
and FLC Lambda, respectively. At each time point, the mean concentrations for Kappa
and Lambda were compared to the initial target range concentration obtained at the zero-
month (T0) time point. The results were acceptable at all tested time points and hence
support the claimed shelf-life stability of the FLC Control Level 1 and FLC Control Level
2 up to 24 months at 2-8oC.

diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) and as an aid in the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis was
previously demonstrated in K210623.
Monitoring of multiple myeloma
1. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical Specificity:
The clinical performance of the Sebia FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda assays as an aid in
monitoring of multiple myeloma (MM) patients was evaluated in serum samples from
subjects diagnosed with MM during treatment and were compared to clinical response
categories based on criteria from the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)
guidelines. The patient inclusion and exclusion criteria were as follows:
Inclusion criteria:
• ≥18 years of age,
• Adequate sample volume for testing
• Confirmed diagnosis of MM at diagnosis time point
• Samples from patients with 1 baseline time point and at least 2 follow-up time points
• At least 20 samples with a “progressive” response criterion, and a significative
representation of all the other responses criteria
• The following information are needed for each sample:
Age, sex, race, ethnicity of patient
Time interval between 2 time points
Treatment start/change date(s), use of chemotherapy or radiation treatment or bone
marrow transplant (when available)
Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP) (M-spike)
Serum IFE
• Frozen samples (storage at -18/-30°C or -70/-80°C),
• Less than 5 freeze-thaw cycles
• Signed informed consent
Exclusion criteria:
• Patients with less than 2 follow-up points
• Not enough collected information available to define the clinical status of the patient,
based on the selected guidance to perform the classification
• Missing FLC values at collection or at retest with the predicate or the candidate
Of the 235 MM subjects, 77 subjects were diagnosed with IgG Kappa, 43 IgG Lambda, 21
IgA Kappa, 21 IgA Lambda, 6 IgM Kappa, 27 Light Chain Kappa MM, and 16 Light Chain
Lambda MM. Six of the 235 subjects had two subtypes (clones) as follows: one IgG Kappa
and IgA Kappa; one IgG Kappa and indeterminate heavy and light chain; one IgG Kappa and
K231601 - Page 7 of 13

--- Page 8 ---
normal heavy chain and indeterminate light chain; one IgA Kappa and IgM Kappa, and two
IgG Lambda and Free Lambda light chain. Of the 136 MM subjects, 48 subjects were
diagnosed with IgG Kappa, 23 IgG Lambda, 14 IgA Kappa, 10 IgA Lambda, 15 Kappa, and 9
Lambda.
Among 234 MM subjects, 139 (59%) were male and 96 (41%) were female. The median age
was 64 years old with the age ranging from 33 to 88 years old. Most of the subjects were
Caucasians (n=158; 67.2%). The remaining subjects were: African American (n=48; 20.4%,),
Asian (n=14; 6.0%); Hispanic (n=12; 5.1%); Other (n=8; 3.4%); and Unknown (n=7; 3.0%).
A total of 551 follow-up samples were tested by the Sebia Kappa FLC and Lambda FLC
Assays. The duration of the monitoring days ranged from 10 days to 2729 days (with a
median of 402 days).
The clinical assessment for each monitoring observation was determined according to IMWG
Version 3.2021/National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice
Guidelines in Oncology on Multiple Myeloma (Kumar et al., 2021). Clinical status of each
monitoring event was categorized into one of six response categories: Stringent Complete
Response (sCR), Complete Response (CR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), Partial
Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), and Progressive Disease (PD). The evaluation of patient
response was regrouped into four categories: Good response (sCR and CR), Moderate
Response (VGPR and PR), Stable Disease and Progressive Disease. Analysis was performed
using these four categories. For each of 551 monitoring observations, the results of the Sebia
Kappa and Lambda FLC assay in combination with other laboratory results were used to
assign a response category and compared to the clinical assessment according to the following
table:

Of the 87 AL-Amyloidosis subjects, 13 subjects were diagnosed with IgG Kappa, 26 IgG
Lambda, 1 IgA Kappa, 6 IgA Lambda, 4 IgM Lambda, 2 Light Chain Kappa AL-Amyloidosis
and 14 Light Chain Lambda AL-Amyloidosis. Three of the 87 AL-Amyloidosis subjects had
two subtypes (clones) as follows: 1 IgG Kappa and IgD Lambda; 1 IgG Lambda and IgG
Lambda; and 1 IgG Kappa and IgM Kappa.
Among 87 subjects, 53 (61%) were male and 34 (39%) were female. The median age was 62
years old with the age ranging from 40 to 81 years old. Most of the subjects were Caucasians
(n=75; 86.2%). The remaining subjects were: African American (n=8; 9.2%,), and Unknown
(n=4; 4.6%). A total of 190 follow-up samples were tested by the Sebia Kappa FLC and
Lambda FLC Assays. The duration of the monitoring days ranged from 64 days to 4474 days
(with a median of 445 days).
To evaluate the clinical performance of Sebia FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda assay, the
response criteria for each follow-up sample of each patient was compared to the respective
individual clinical status. Five response criteria: CR (Complete Response), VGPR (Very Good
Partial Response), PR (Partial Response), SD/NR (Stable Disease/No response), PD
(Progressive Disease) were used to categorize each monitoring outcome for each patient based
on the FLC Kappa and FLC Lambda results according to the following two therapy response
evaluation criteria:
• Evaluation Mode 1 based on criteria established by Palladini and colleagues (Comenzo et
al., 2012; Palladini et al., 2012; Palladini et al., 2021),
• Evaluation Mode 2 based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network. "NCCN clinical
practice guidelines in oncology (NCCN guidelines)." Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis
Version 1 (2022): 1–27
