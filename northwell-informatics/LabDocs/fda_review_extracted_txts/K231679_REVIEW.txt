A Device Description:
K231679 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
The CONTOUR® PLUS BLUE Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the CONTOUR®
PLUS BLUE blood glucose meter, CONTOUR® PLUS blood glucose test strips and the
CONTOUR® Diabetes App. The CONTOUR® PLUS control solution (Level 1 and Level 2)
and the Microlet® NEXT lancing device and MICROLET®lancets (K220633) are to be used
with the system and are sold separately. The CONTOUR® Diabetes App (previously cleared for
use with the predicate CONTOUR® NEXT GEN Blood Glucose Monitoring System, k193407)
is used as an optional display for results obtained with the subject device and may be used to
change the CONTOUR® PLUS BLUE blood glucose meter settings.
B Principle of Operation:
The Contour® PLUS BLUE Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures the amount of glucose
in whole blood quantitatively using fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip and displays
plasma equivalent results. The reaction of glucose dehydrogenase and an electron mediator in the
test strip with glucose in the sample produces an electrical current which is proportional to the
amount of glucose in the sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the
corresponding glucose concentration, which is displayed by the meter’s display screen and may
be used to transmit glucose values and associated data wirelessly via Bluetooth Low Energy
technology to and the Contour® Diabetes App.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
CONTOUR® PLUS BLUE blood glucose meter
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The system is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip. The whole
blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action. Samples are tested
immediately upon collection.
4. Calibration:
The meter is automatically coded and does not require calibration or coding by the user.
5. Quality Control:
Two levels of glucose control solutions are available for use with the CONTOUR® PLUS
PLUS BLUE Blood Glucose Monitoring System which are used as a quality control check to
ensure the customer that their CONTOUR® PLUS BLUE system is working properly. The
CONTOUR® PLUS BLUE meter recognizes and distinguishes the control material from
patient specimens automatically.
K231679 - Page 3 of 12

--- Page 4 ---
Recommendations on when to test with control solutions are provided in the labeling.
Acceptable ranges for each level of control solution are printed on the test strip bottle
packaging. If controls solutions fall outside the printed ranges the labeling instructs the
customer to not use the system until the issue has been resolved and provides customer
service contact details for support, as needed. The control test results are not included in the
meter Logbook and are kept separate from the patient glucose averaging features such as
blood glucose averages.

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the glucose measurement was evaluated using venous whole blood samples
adjusted to 14 glucose levels ranging from 10 to 615 mg/dL (10, 20, 40, 80, 140, 200, 260,
320, 380, 440, 500, 560, 600 and 615 mg/dL as measured by comparator method YSI 2300
Analyzer) with 3 lots of test strips. The results of linear regression analysis are summarized
below:
Test Strip Lot # Slope y-intercept R2-value
Lot 1 1.00 0.45 0.9989
Lot 2 1.00 1.01 0.9986
Lot 3 0.99 1.23 0.9984
Combined 1.00 0.90 0.9985
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20-600
mg/dL. If a sample result is less than 20 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as
“Lo”. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as
“Hi”. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated by the sponsor and were demonstrated to
function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Studies were performed to evaluate the effect of common exogenous and endogenous
compounds on the performance of the CONTOUR® PLUS BLUE Blood Glucose
Monitoring System. Venous whole blood samples were prepared at glucose concentrations
of approximately 60 mg/dL , 120 mg/dL and 260 mg/dL and were divided into a test pool
with the potential interferent added and a control sample with no added interferent. Each was
tested using three test strip lots on each of the 10 meters resulting in 30 measurements per
sample. Results on the candidate meter from the test samples were compared to results
obtained on the candidate meter from the control sample. The highest tested concentrations at
which no significant interference (as defined by the sponsor as less than ±8% bias between
the test and control samples) was observed are presented in the following table:

K231679 - Page 9 of 12

--- Page 10 ---
The results from three test strip lots were analyzed by comparing the blood glucose results
obtained by the lay users with the Contour® plus BLUE Blood Glucose Monitoring System
against results obtained with a laboratory-based comparator method (YSI Model 2300 STAT
PLUS glucose analyzer). The glucose concentrations in the native samples ranged from 40.5
to 409 mg/dL, as measured by the comparator method. Results are summarized in the tables
below:
Results from all glucose concentrations combined
Within ±5% Within ±10% Within ±15% Within ±20%
270/381 (70.87%) 362/381 (95.01%) 373/381 (97.90%) 381/381 (100%)
Regression analysis of the data produced a slope of 1.015, an intercept of -1.2, and an r value
of 0.981.
At the end of the lay-user study, each participant was asked to complete a usability
questionnaire regarding ease of understanding of information in the user manual and the ease
of use when performing a blood glucose test. The results demonstrate that the participants
were able to successfully perform the test, received accurate results, and found the Contour®
Plus BLUE Blood Glucose Monitoring System easy to use and the labeling easy to follow.
A Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level assessment was conducted on the Contour® Plus Blue User
Guide, Contour® Plus Blue Test Strips and Contour® Plus Blue Quick Start Guide and the
results demonstrated that the labeling was written at lower than 8th grade level.
Accuracy at extreme glucose concentrations
A study was conducted to assess the accuracy of Contour® PLUS BLUE Blood Glucose
Monitoring System at extremely low and high glucose levels using contrived capillary blood
specimens. Fifty-two (52) fingerstick specimens were glycolyzed to achieve glucose levels
below 80 mg/dL, and 58 fingerstick specimens were supplemented with glucose solution to
achieve levels above 250 mg/dL. All samples were tested with the Contour® PLUS BLUE
Blood Glucose Monitoring System with two test strips from 3 lots and compared to the
results obtained on the comparator method (YSI 2300). Results from one representative lot
are summarized below:

activity. Nondiabetic plasma glucose concentrations should be less than 100 mg/dL in the fasting
state and less than 140 mg/dL in the postprandial state (after a meal). You should consult with
your health care professional for glucose values specific to your needs.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit study
To evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the Contour® Plus BLUE Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, the sponsor analyzed venous whole blood samples at hematocrit levels of 20, 25, 30,
35, 42, 50, 55, and 60%. Each hematocrit level was adjusted to achieve five glucose levels of
approximately 40, 70, 130, 200, and 350 mg/dL. Three strip lots and 24 meters were used to
collect data for each hematocrit level and glucose level (n=24 per lot per hematocrit per
glucose level). The percent biases relative to the comparator method (YSI 2300) were
acceptable to support the claimed hematocrit range in the labeling of 20 to 55%.
2. Sample volume
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.6 µL.
Venous whole blood samples were adjusted to approximately 55, 110 and 220 mg/dL
glucose. Each sample was analyzed with sample sizes of 0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60, and 0.70 µL
using three strip lots and 10 Contour® Plus BLUE meters. Results support the sponsor’s
minimum claimed sample volume of 0.6 µL. The study also demonstrated that with sample
volumes below 0.6 μL, the insufficient sample volume error message (E1) functioned as
intended.
3. Operating conditions study
The effect of operating temperatures and relative humidity on the performance of the
Contour® PLUS BLUE Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous
whole blood samples adjusted to approximately 40, 120, 350, and 525 mg/dL. Testing was
conducted under the following temperature and relative humidity (RH) combinations: 5°C /
10% RH (low temperature, low humidity); 5°C / 93% RH (low temperature, high humidity);
45°C / 10% RH (high temperature, low humidity); 45°C / 93% RH (high temperature, high
humidity). Glucose results obtained under these conditions was collected using 15 Contour®
PLUS BLUE glucose meters and three lots of test strips and results were compared to the
nominal condition (25°C / 50% RH). The study results support the claimed operating
conditions of 5°C to 45°C (41°F to 113°F) with relative humidity of 10% to 93%.

4. Altitude study
To evaluate the effect of altitude, a study was conducted using venous whole blood samples
adjusted to four concentration levels of glucose ranging from 45-400 mg/dL. Samples were
placed under conditions to simulate altitude condition from 443 feet (sea level) to 20,674
feet. Each blood sample was tested using six meters with two lots of test strips. The values
obtained at simulated altitudes were compared with the values obtained at the nominal
condition. The results demonstrated acceptable bias to the nominal condition to support the
claim in the labeling that glucose measurement performance is maintained at altitudes up to
20,674 feet.
5. Flex Studies
The following additional flex studies were performed with the Contour® Plus BLUE Blood
Glucose Monitoring System: sample perturbation, used test strips, intermittent sampling
(Second-Chance sampling), drop and sample outside measuring range. The testing
demonstrated that the device is robust under these conditions.
6. Electrical Safety and EMC Testing
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed, and the system was found
to be compliant.
7. Infection Control Studies
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the external materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing
laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen
disinfectant, SaniCloth Plus Germicidal Disposable Cloths (EPA Reg # 9480-6). A
robustness study was also conducted by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change
in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection
cycles using the SaniCloth Plus Germicidal Disposable Cloths. The robustness studies were
designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8. Test Strip Lot Release Protocol
Glucose test strip lot release protocols and criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
