B Indication(s) for Use:
The ARK Hydrocodone Assay is an immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection and/or
semi-quantitative estimation of hydrocodone and its metabolites in human urine at a cutoff of
300 ng/mL. The semi-quantitative mode is for the purpose of (1) enabling laboratories to
determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method,
such as Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography/tandem
Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), or (2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control
procedures.
The ARK Hydrocodone Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed positive analytical
result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography/tandem
Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration
and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug test result, particularly when the
preliminary test result is positive.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Beckman Coulter AU 680 chemistry analyzer was used to generate data for this submission.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ARK Hydrocodone Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay (HEIA) technique used
for the analysis of Hydrocodone in human urine. The ARK Hydrocodone Assay test system
includes separately provided test kits for the ARK Hydrocodone Assay.
The ARK Hydrocodone Assay consists of reagents R1 and R2.
Reagent R1 – Antibody/Substrate solution contains: Rabbit monoclonal antibodies to
hydrocodone, glucose-6-phosphate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, bovine serum albumin,
sodium azide, and stabilizers.
Reagent R2 – Enzyme solution contains: Hydrocodone derivative labeled with recombinant
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (rG6PDH), bovine serum albumin, buffer, sodium azide and
stabilizer.
B Principle of Operation:
The ARK Hydrocodone Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay. The assay uses specific
antibodies that can detect hydrocodone and its metabolites without any significant cross-
K231752 - Page 2 of 15

--- Page 3 ---
reactivity to other opiate compounds. The assay is based on competition between a drug labeled
with recombinant glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (rG6PDH) and free drug from the urine
sample, for a fixed amount of specific antibody binding sites. In the absence of free drug from
the sample, rabbit monoclonal anti-hydrocodone antibody binds to the drug labeled with
rG6PDH and causes a decrease in enzyme activity. In the presence of hydrocodone from the
specimen, enzyme activity increases and is directly related to the hydrocodone concentration.
Endogenous G6PDH does not interfere because the coenzyme NAD functions only with the
bacterial enzyme used in the assay. The enzyme activity is determined spectrophotometrically at
340 nm by measuring the conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed based upon recommendations in the CLSI (EP5‐A3)
guideline. Drug free urine samples were spiked with hydrocodone at 0, 75, 150, 225, 300,
375, 450, 525 and 600 ng/mL, representing 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 and 200% of the
device cutoff (300 ng/mL). Each sample was tested in quadruplicate per run, two runs per
day for twenty consecutive days (total N= 160/level/reagent lot) using 2 reagent lots on the
Beckman Coulter AU680 chemistry analyzer. The results are shown below:

2. Linearity/Recovery:
Linearity study in the semi-quantitative mode was conducted by spiking a drug free urine
pool with hydrocodone (serial dilutions of a high concentration hydrocodone in negative
urine pool) to achieve concentrations ranging from 0 ng/mL to 800 ng/mL, and testing each
level on two reagent lots in replicates of five on the Beckman Coulter AU680 clinical
chemistry analyzer. The results from a representative lot are summarized below:

Specificity:
An analytical specificity study to evaluate interference from non-structurally and structurally
related compounds was performed in the qualitative and semi-quantitative mode. The study
design and results are described below. Results were the same for each mode (qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes).
Hydrocodone and its Metabolites
The following metabolites of hydrocodone were approximately equivalent to the 300 ng/mL
cutoff at the concentrations tested with the ARK Hydrocodone Assay. Dihydrocodeine tested
negative at 100,000 ng/mL. Immunoassay reactivity for hydrocodone and hydromorphone
were equivalent.

Endogenous Compounds
Potential interference from endogenous compounds commonly found in urine was evaluated
in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes, by spiking these compounds into drug free
urine containing hydrocodone at ± 25% of the 300 ng/mL cutoff (225 and 375 ng/mL).

pH and Specific Gravity:
For potential interference from the pH of urine, device performance in the qualitative and
semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine pH values (3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0,
8.0, 9.0,10.0 and 11.0). All test samples were prepared in drug free urine containing
hydrocodone at ± 25% of the cutoff (225 ng/mL and 375 ng/mL hydrocodone

ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 for each test mode.
For potential interference from the specific gravity of urine, device performance in the
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes was tested using a range of urine specific gravity
values (1.000, 1.0021, 1.0043, 1.0179, 1.0187, 1.0262, 1.0303). All test samples were
prepared in drug free urine containing hydrocodone at ± 25% of the cutoff (225 ng/mL and
375 ng/mL hydrocodone concentrations). No positive or negative interference was observed
at urine specific gravity values ranging from 1.000 to 1.0303 for each test mode.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A total of 226 unaltered urine samples from pain management laboratories were analyzed by
two lots of the candidate device in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes on the
Beckman Coulter AU680 clinical chemistry analyzer and the comparative mass spectrometry
based quantitative method (LC-MS/MS). LC-MS/MS and immunoassay qualitative results
are based on a 300ng/mL cutoff. The results from the study in the two modes are summarized

For Sample #38, the hydrocodone concentration was 306.5 ng/mL by LC-MS/MS and 307.0
ng/mL (positive) in semi-quantitative protocol and negative in the qualitative mode. The
remaining 16 discordant samples all tested positive, greater than cutoff, by both ARK assay
protocols. Cross-reactivity to the major metabolite hydromorphone contributed to the
positive results for some of the samples with <300 ng/mL hydrocodone by LC-MS/MS.
