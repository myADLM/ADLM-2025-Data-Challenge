and laboratory findings. The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis,
treatment, or other patient management decisions.
Negative results in the setting of a respiratory illness may be due to infection with pathogens that
are not detected by this test, or lower respiratory tract infection that may not be detected by a
nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Positive results do not rule out coinfection with other organisms.
The agent(s) detected by the NxTAG RPP v2 may not be the definite cause of disease.
Additional laboratory testing (e.g., bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence, and
radiography) may be necessary when evaluating a patient with possible respiratory tract
infection.
The NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel v2 is indicated for use with the Luminex MAGPIX
Instrument and xPONENT and SYNCT software.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

D Special Instrument Requirements:
Luminex MAGPIX Instrument
bioMérieux NUCLISENS easyMAG Instrument or EMAG Instrument
IVD-Labeled Thermal Cycler
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel v2 (NxTAG RPP v2) is a qualitative reverse-
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic assay for the simultaneous
detection and discrimination of 21 viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal
swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection. The assay
uses the proprietary Luminex bead hybridization tag sorting system to discriminate amplified
products and is performed on the Luminex MAGPIX Instrument equipped with xPONENT
software following nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification using off-the-shelf instrument
systems. Signals obtained with the MAGPIX Instrument are analyzed using the NxTAG RPP v2
Assay File for SYNCT Software.
The NxTAG RPP v2 differs from the original NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (NxTAG
RPP; K152386/K193167) as shown in Table 1. Other minor differences include changes to the
fluorescence thresholds for certain assays and the Internal Control.

Influenza A H3 Modified primers for improved inclusivity
Human Bocavirus Results not reported
Human Metapneumovirus New target region for improved inclusivity
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus Modified formulation for improved specificity
SARS-CoV-2 New analyte
B Principle of Operation:
Nucleic acids are extracted for analysis from nasopharyngeal swab samples in transport medium
using either the IVD-labeled bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG or EMAG extraction systems.
The extracted nucleic acids are added to 96-well plates containing lyophilized PCR primers,
hybridization beads and amplification enzymes. Following rehydration, the plates are sealed and
loaded into a thermocycler for reverse transcription and PCR amplification. The amplified PCR
products hybridize to the tagged beads in near real-time and upon completion of the reaction, the
sealed plate is loaded into the MAGPIX Instrument for automated bead sorting and fluorescence
reading using xPONENT 4.3u2 software. The data are analyzed using the NxTAG RPP v2 Assay
File for SYNCT 1.1u2 software and results for each analyte are reported as “detected”, “not
detected” or “invalid”. Details of the method of result interpretation for influenza A and its
associated subtypes are provided in Table 2.

1 Detection of influenza A H1, A H1pdm09 or A H3 subtypes without a corresponding positive result for influenza A may occur
at low target levels, be due to contamination or be indicative of a mutation in the matrix gene target region used for detection
of influenza A. Retesting is recommended prior to reporting test results if clinically indicated or for epidemiological
investigation. Further investigation may be warranted if the same result is generated upon retesting.
2 Co-detection of multiple influenza A subtypes (H1 and/or H1pdm09 and/or H3) may be due to coinfection, false-positive
results due to contamination or the presence of a multi-valent influenza virus vaccine in the sample. Retesting is recommended
prior to reporting test results. If the same result is obtained upon retest, the presence of multiple subtypes should be confirmed
by alternative FDA-cleared methods.
3 Detection of influenza A without a corresponding positive result for an influenza A subtype may occur at low target levels, be
due to contamination or be indicative of the presence of a novel influenza A strain. If a specimen is confirmed positive for
influenza A on retesting but produces negative test results for A H1, A H1pdm09 and A H3, the appropriate local, state, or
federal public health authorities should be notified to determine necessary measures for verification and to determine whether
the specimen contains a novel strain of Influenza A.

C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Luminex MAGPIX Instrument
bioMérieux NUCLISENS easyMAG Instrument or EMAG Instrument
IVD-labeled thermal cycler
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification numbers may be entered into the SYNCT Software manually or
using the optional barcode reader.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The NxTAG RPP v2 assay is intended for use with nasopharyngeal swabs collected in
Universal Transport Medium (UTM, Copan Diagnostics) or MicroTest M4RT medium
(Remel) using a nylon flocked or polyester swab. Specimens may be stored for up to 7 days
at 2-8 °C or up to 12 months at ≤ -70 °C.
The respective locations of Positive and Negative External Controls and patient samples on
the MAGPIX assay plate must be defined in the SYNCT Software. For controls, the expected
results for each analyte must also be assigned. Each sample and control within a run must
have a unique identifier. The locations of the External Controls should be selected to enable
correct orientation of the MAGPIX plate.
The SYNCT software may be used to select which test results to report for each sample prior
to analysis based on the test order. Masked results will not be reported. A default Test Panel
that includes all available analytes is provided but, for convenience, users also have the
option to create custom Test Panels from within the list of available NxTAG RPP v2 target
analytes. Targets that were previously masked, may be unmasked by reanalyzing the data in
the SYNCT software upon receipt of an appropriate test order.
4. Calibration:
Calibration of the MAGPIX Instrument using the MAGPIX Calibration Kit is required at
least weekly to normalize the settings for the classification and reporter optical channels.
Following calibration, the MAGPIX Performance Verification Kit must be used to verify the
integrity of the system. Daily use of the MAGPIX Performance Verification Kit to verify the
calibration and optical integrity of the MAGPIX system and the fluidics channels is also
recommended. The MAGPIX Calibration Kit and MAGPIX Performance Verification Kit
are provided separately from the NxTAG RPP v2.
5. Quality Control:
Prior to processing, bacteriophage MS2 is added to each patient sample or External Control
as an Internal Control to monitor the integrity of nucleic acid extraction, reverse
transcription, PCR amplification and detection. External Positive Controls for use with the
K231758 - Page 6 of 51

--- Page 7 ---
NxTAG RPP v2 assay are not provided with the assay kit but are recommended for use in
accordance with local, state and/or federal guidelines and good laboratory practices.
Luminex recommends inclusion of a Negative Extraction Control (transport medium) to
monitor for contamination. Optionally, a Negative Amplification Control comprised of
RNase-free water may be included on each amplification plate to monitor for contamination
downstream from the nucleic acid extraction process. The Negative Extraction Control and
Negative Amplification Control should produce negative test results for all analytes.
If the External Positive Control, Negative Amplification Control and Negative Extraction
Control do not produce the expected results, patient results should not be reported.

The lot-to-lot precision of the NxTAG RPP v2 was evaluated using three lots of assay kits,
each containing unique lots of critical raw materials/sub-components. The panel of samples
for analysis comprised simulated nasopharyngeal swab matrix that was spiked with different
combinations of all the NxTAG RPP v2 analytes, as well as a negative sample (Table 3).
Please refer to Section VII A (6) for data supporting use of simulated nasopharyngeal swab
matrix for Analytical Studies, as well as testing of samples containing multiple analytes.
Each positive panel member was prepared at both low and moderate target levels (1.5X [low]
and 5X LoD [moderate], respectively, except where noted). Each panel member at each

concentration was tested a total of 10 times with each lot of reagents (total 30 replicates per
panel member per target level). There was close to 100% positive and negative agreement
with the expected results for each panel member at each target level with all three lots of
reagents (Table 4). These results are acceptable.

Site-to-Site and Within-Site (Operator-to-Operator) Reproducibility
The site-to-site and within site (operator-to-operator) reproducibility of the NxTAG RPP v2
was evaluated using a panel of samples that were tested by two operators at each of three
study sites in replicates of four on five non-consecutive days, using a single reagent lot and
unique set of critical equipment at each site (2 operators x 3 sites x 4 replicates x 5 days x 1

lot = 120 replicates per panel member). The panel of samples for analysis comprised
simulated nasopharyngeal swab matrix that was spiked with different combinations of a
subset of 11 of the NxTAG RPP v2 target analytes, as well as a negative sample (Table 5).
Each positive panel member was prepared at both low and moderate target levels (1.5X and
5X LoD, respectively, except where noted). Positive and negative agreement for each panel
member within and between study sites and operators was close to 100% (Table 6). These
results are acceptable.

In silico Analysis
An in silico BLAST analysis was performed to evaluate the potential for cross-reaction of the
NxTAG RPP v2 oligonucleotides with nucleic acids from on- and off-panel species. The
analysis was performed with all the primers and probes in the assay mixture against
sequences in the GenBank nt sequence database as of April 9, 2023. Prediction of potential
cross-reaction/interference was based on the percentage homology with the non-target
sequences, the relative locations of potential hybridization (amplicon length), the location of
any mismatches and predicted T . Based on this analysis, the NxTAG RPP v2 SARS-CoV-2
m
primers and probe were determined to cross-react with some bat coronavirus and bat-SARS-
like coronavirus strains. In addition, the Coronavirus 229E primers and probe are predicted to
cross-react with 229E-like coronavirus sequences from bats. This observation was confirmed
empirically using synthetic template. The potential for cross-reaction of the Coronavirus

NL63 primers and probes with bat-coronaviruses was demonstrated in silico but was not
confirmed through functional testing. Overall, in silico analysis demonstrated low likelihood
for cross-reaction of the NxTAG RPP v2 assay primers and probes with non-target nucleic
acids. However, the potential for cross-reaction with some bat SARS-like and 229E-like
coronavirus strains is noted as a Limitation in the device labeling.
Laboratory Testing of Analytical Specificity
The analytical specificity of the NxTAG RPP v2 was evaluated by testing high
concentrations of potentially cross-reactive on- and off-panel bacteria, fungi and viruses, in
addition to pooled nasal wash. No unexpected cross-reaction was observed except with
Enterovirus 68 (Species D, US/IL/14-18952), which produced false-positive results for
Influenza A H3 (Tables 7 and 8). This is noted as a Limitation in the device labeling.

Off-Panel Microbial Interference
The potential for interference with the NxTAG RPP by off-panel microorganisms that may
be present in nasopharyngeal swab specimens was evaluated by testing 11 potentially cross-
reactive species (Table 9) at high concentration in the presence of low-moderate levels of 22
on-panel target analytes, including different subtypes of influenza A. Testing was performed
with combinations of two or three off-panel analytes at high concentration in the presence of
different combinations of three on-panel analytes, each at ~3-6X LoD. The expected positive

Coronavirus NL63 and Coronavirus HKU1 but produced the expected positive results for both analytes upon repeat.
On-Panel Competitive Interference
The potential for competitive interference between viral and bacterial species targeted by the
NxTAG RPP v2 assay was evaluated by testing combinations of on panel analytes at
asymmetric concentrations. Analytes at low-moderate concentration (3-6X LoD) were
combined into four groups (Table 10) that were each tested in the presence of a single high
concentration analyte (Table 11) in simulated nasopharyngeal swab matrix. In all cases (n =
3 ea.), each analyte was successfully detected irrespective of the concentration tested,
demonstrating the absence of assay interference.

Interfering Substances
Testing was conducted to evaluate the potential for interference with the NxTAG RPP v2 assay
by endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in nasopharyngeal swab
specimens. Eight multi-analyte samples (Table 13) comprised of simulated nasopharyngeal swab
matrix containing on-panel analytes at 3-6X LoD were tested in triplicate in the presence of 22
potentially interfering substances (Table 14). Each substance was also added to negative
simulated nasopharyngeal matrix to evaluate the potential for false positive results.
The expected results were obtained in all cases, except in the presence of menthol and FluMist
influenza vaccine. Menthol 1% (w/v) was shown to interfere with the detection of Coronavirus

OC43, although no interference was observed at lower concentration (0.5% w/v). Positive results
for Influenza A, Influenza A H1pdm09, Influenza A H3 and Influenza B were obtained in the
presence of FluMist because the vaccine contains attenuated strains of these analytes that are
detectable at the levels used in this study. The potential for false results with menthol and
FluMist is noted in the Limitations section of the device labeling.

1 On initial testing, 1/3 replicates with Sample 5 from Table 13 produced false negative results for Coronavirus NL63 and
Coronavirus HKU1 and the result was confirmed upon retesting; however, upon testing with new samples 3/3 replicates gave
the expected positive results.
2 On initial testing, 1/3 replicates with Sample 2 from Table 13 produced a false negative result for RSV B; upon re-testing of
the same sample, the expected result was obtained.
3 All samples containing FluMist produced positive results for influenza A, influenza A H1pdm09, influenza A H3 and
influenza B; this is noted as a Limitation in the device labeling.
4 3/3 replicates in the presence of 1% (w/v) menthol produced false negative results for Coronavirus OC43; interference by
menthol was alleviated at lower concentration (0.5% w/v); this is noted as a Limitation in the device labeling.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Controls
Bacteriophage MS2 is added to each sample to be tested with the NxTAG RPP v2 prior to
nucleic acid extraction as an internal control to monitor process and reagent integrity. Failure
to detect the MS2 control (in conjunction with failure to detect any of the target analytes) is
indicative of failure of one or more processes: nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription
PCR amplification and/or detection.

External Controls
External Positive and Negative Controls are not provided with in the NxTAG RPP v2 assay
kit but are recommended for inclusion in every assay run in accordance with good laboratory
practice and applicable local, state and federal accrediting organizations. External Controls
will be reported as “Pass”, “Fail” or “Invalid” in accordance with the expected values entered
by the user in the SYNCT Software.
External Positive and Negative Controls were included in each run of the NxTAG RPP v2
assay in the Clinical Studies described in Section VII C. On each day of testing, the External
Positive and Negative Controls were required to produce the expected results for the results
obtained with clinical specimens to be considered acceptable.
Specimen Stability
To evaluate the stability of the NxTAG RPP v2 target analytes in nasopharyngeal swab
matrix, separate studies were performed with samples prepared in Universal Transport
Medium (UTM, Copan Diagnostics) and MicroTest M4RT (M4RT, Remel). All the analytes
targeted by the NxTAG RPP v2 assay were included in the analysis of performance with
UTM, whereas only a representative subset was included in evaluating the stability of
specimens prepared in M4RT (Table 15). The positive samples for testing were prepared at
two concentrations (1.5X [Low] and 5X LoD [Moderate], unless otherwise noted in Table
15) and stored at 2-8 °C or -70 ± 5 °C prior to testing. The results of the study support the
claimed stability of the target analytes in nasopharyngeal swab matrix collected in UTM or
M4RT for up to 7 days at 2-8 °C or 12 months at -70 ± 5 °C.
Additional testing also demonstrated the stability of extracted nucleic acid after storage at 2-8
°C for up to 4 hours or -70 ± 5 °C for up to 12 months.

Reagent Stability
A Real-time Stability Study to evaluate the stability of the NxTAG RPP v2 reagents under
the recommended storage conditions of 2-8 °C is currently on-going. The study includes
three independent kit lots that were manufactured with unique lots of critical reagents. Each
kit lot will be tested at 3-month intervals over the course of the study using a panel of
Positive Controls that collectively include target nucleic acids for each assay on the panel, in
addition to the MS2 bacteriophage Internal Control (n = 3 replicates per assay per kit lot at
each test point). To-date, testing has been completed that supports the stability of NxTAG
RPP v2 kits for up to 12 months from the date of manufacture when stored under the
recommended conditions.
In-use Reagent Stability
Lyophilized NxTAG RPP v2 assay reagents are supplied in foil-sealed 8-well strips that are
packaged in sealed pouches of 96 reactions and stored at 2-8 °C. Testing was performed to
demonstrate the stability of the prefilled wells after removal from the original packaging,
prior to sample addition. Additional testing was also conducted to support resealing of the
original reagent pouch and storage of unused foil-sealed wells if less than a full 96 well plate
of reactions is consumed. Under all conditions tested, the expected results were obtained,
supporting the in-use stability of NxTAG RPP v2 reagents in accordance with the
Instructions For Use.

6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Detection
The analytical sensitivity of the NxTAG RPP v2 was evaluated by testing contrived
specimens that were prepared by adding quantified, diluted stocks of representative viral and
bacterial strains/isolates of each target analyte to pooled negative nasopharyngeal swab
matrix in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) that was processed using the bioMérieux
EMAG Extraction System. Each analyte was tested individually in a three-fold dilution series
to estimate the limit of detection (LoD) which was then confirmed by testing an additional 20
replicates at or near the concentration that yielded 3/3 positive replicates in the preliminary
titration. The confirmed LoD for each strain/isolate was defined as the lowest concentration
that yielded ≥ 19/20 positive replicates (i.e., ≥ 95% proportion positive) (Table 16).

Limit of Detection with Multi-analyte Samples and Simulated Nasopharyngeal Swab Matrix
Additional testing was performed to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of the NxTAG RPP v2
assay with samples containing multiple target analytes and to evaluate use of simulated
nasopharyngeal swab matrix in analytical studies. Samples containing combinations of two
or three target species at concentrations equivalent to 1-2X the confirmed single target LoD
in either negative clinical or simulated nasopharyngeal swab matrix were tested in parallel.
The analyte combinations evaluated are shown in Table 17. Twenty replicates of each
analyte combination were included in the study and all analytes were successfully detected (≥
95% proportion positive), demonstrating the absence of interference from the presence of
multiple analytes at levels close to the LoD of assay and supporting use simulated
nasopharyngeal swab matrix in other analytical studies to evaluate device performance.

Comparison of Alternative Methods of Nucleic Acid Extraction
The analytical sensitivity of the NxTAG RPP v2 assay was established using samples that
were processed using the bioMérieux EMAG Extraction System and NUCLISENS extraction
reagents. Additional testing was performed to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of the assay
with the alternative NUCLISENS easyMAG Extraction System, which uses the same
extraction reagents as the EMAG instrument. Representative strains/isolates of each of the
NxTAG RPP v2 target analytes were diluted in negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix in
UTM at levels close to the LoD established using the bioMérieux EMAG Extraction System
(Table 16). The combinations of strains/isolates used was the same as that described in
Table 15, above. For each of the analytes, ≥ 95% of replicates produced positive results at ≤
2X the established LoD of the NxTAG RPP v2 assay (Table 18), demonstrating that the
analytical sensitivity is similar with both nucleic acid extraction systems.

Analytical Sensitivity with the WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2
The analytical sensitivity of the NxTAG RPP v2 was also evaluated using the WHO
International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 (NIBSC 20/146: Heat inactivated England/02/2020).
Serial dilutions of the standard were prepared in pooled nasopharyngeal swab matrix and
tested. The LoD with the WHO International Standard, defined as the lowest concentration
that produced ≥ 95% positive replicates, was determined to be 7.70 x 105 IU/mL.
Inclusivity
In silico Analysis
The inclusivity of the NxTAG RPP v2 SARS-CoV-2 primers and probes was evaluated using
5,859,379 SARS-CoV-2 sequences available in the GISAID EpiCoV database as of
November 30, 2023, including sequences from all defined variants of concern or interest. The
NxTAG RPP v2 assay is predicted to detect all the SARS-CoV-2 sequences evaluated.
The inclusivity of the NxTAG RPP v2 primers and probes for influenza A and B was
evaluated using sequences in the GISAID EpiFlu database from two time periods: January 1,
2000 to December 31, 2008 for influenza A H1 and January 1, 2017 to May 5, 2023 for
influenza A H1pdm09, influenza A H3 and influenza B. The NxTAG RPP v2 primers and
probes for influenza A, the influenza A subtypes H1, H1pdm09 and H3, and influenza B
were predicted to detect approximately 97-100% of the respective target sequences analyzed.
The inclusivity of the NxTAG RPP v2 primers and probes for all other analytes was
evaluated using sequences of the target analytes that were deposited in the NCBI GenBank nt
database as of April 8, 2023. Based on this analysis, ≥ 96% of sequences of each analyte
were predicted to be detected, except for Parainfluenza Virus 2 (~92%) and untyped strains
of Parainfluenza Virus 4 (~94%), which exhibited increased potential for mismatches with
the corresponding NxTAG RPP v2 primers and probes which could affect analytical and/or
clinical sensitivity. The potential for false-negative results with certain strains of
Parainfluenza Virus 2 and 4 based on in silico analysis is noted as Limitation in the device
labeling.
Laboratory Testing of Inclusivity
The inclusivity (analytical reactivity) of the NxTAG RPP v2 assay was evaluated using a
panel of representative strains of each of the analytes on the panel. Testing of each
strain/isolate was performed in at least triplicate by adding a quantified, diluted stock to
simulated or natural nasopharyngeal swab matrix at a final concentration equivalent to 3X
the claimed LoD for the analyte. If negative results were obtained with one or more

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The design of the NxTAG RPP v2 assay was based on that of the previously FDA-cleared
NxTAG RPP (K152386/K193167), with various modifications aimed to improve inclusivity
and specificity, for the addition of SARS-CoV-2 as a target analyte and for discrimination of
Influenza A H1pdm09. Because of these changes, a new threshold analysis was performed
using a combination of clinical and contrived specimens, as well as negative controls.
The thresholds for the NxTAG RPP v2 assay were established in a three-step optimization
process:
a) Selection of an initial range of threshold values for each analyte;
b) Determination of performance for each analyte using the range of potential threshold
values;
c) Optimization of the thresholds through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curve analysis.
Discrete data sets were used for preliminary threshold selection, performance evaluation
(optimization) and validation. The final optimized thresholds were used to analyze the data
obtained in the Analytical and Clinical Studies described in Sections VII A, B and C.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Refer to Section VII C Clinical Studies.
9. Carry-Over:
The potential for contamination within and between runs of the NxTAG RPP v2 assay was
evaluated by testing high concentrations of two representative analytes (SARS-CoV-2 and M.
pneumoniae at 105 TCID and 106 CCU/mL, respectively) in simulated nasopharyngeal swab
50
matrix, in conjunction with negative samples. Five MAGPIX runs were performed on two
instruments using an alternating pattern of high positive and negative samples (n = 12 ea.)
that were processed on two bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG extraction systems. On initial
testing, 2/12 negative samples in one MAGPIX run gave positive results for SARS-CoV-2
(Table 31). Repreparation, extraction and testing of 12 additional positive and 12 additional
negative samples on the same easyMAG and MAGPIX instruments produced the expected
results. Overall, in conjunction with the results of the Prospective Clinical Study described in
Section VIII ©, the likelihood of false positive results with the NxTAG RPP v2 assay due to
cross-contamination was considered acceptable.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not applicable.
2. Matrix Comparison:
Comparison of Natural and Simulated Nasopharyngeal Swab Matrix
Please refer to Section VII A (6) regarding use of simulated nasopharyngeal swab matrix in
Analytical Studies to evaluate the performance of the NxTAG RPP v2 assay.
Comparison of Alternative Transport Media
The compatibility of the NxTAG RPP v2 assay with nasopharyngeal swabs collected in
alternative transport media was evaluated by testing contrived specimens composed of
negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix containing representative NxTAG RPP v2 target
analytes at levels above and below the LoD established with Universal Transport Medium
(UTM, Copan Diagnostics) (Table 32). The NxTAG RPP V2 assay demonstrated similar
analytical sensitivity (≥ 95% detection at 1 - 3X LoD) with specimens prepared in both
transport media evaluated, supporting the use of these media for specimen collection (Table
33).

Comparison of Alternative Swabs for Specimen Collection
The compatibility of the NxTAG RPP v2 assay with alternative types of collection swab was
evaluated by testing flocked nylon, polyester and rayon swabs that were seeded with
simulated nasopharyngeal swab matrix containing representative target analytes (Table 34).
Swabs of each type were prepared and expressed in 1 mL Universal Transport Medium prior
to testing with the NxTAG RPP v2 assay. All results for flocked nylon and polyester swabs
were as expected. However, diminished recovery/detection from rayon swabs was observed
for multiple analytes (Table 35). As a result, the device labeling includes a Limitation
indicating that rayon nasopharyngeal swabs are not compatible with the NxTAG RPP v2
assay.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Study Design
The performance of the NxTAG RPP v2 was evaluated in a multi-site Clinical Study using a
combination of nasopharyngeal swab specimens that were either:
a) prospectively collected and tested fresh (Category I specimens), or after freezing at ≤
-70 °C and thawing if they could not be processed within 7 days (Category II
specimens), or
b) preselected, archived specimens (Category III specimens), or
c) contrived simulated specimens (Category IV specimens).
For inclusion in the study, Category I, II or III specimens were obtained from patients
exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection. Samples for testing with the
NxTAG RPP v2 assay were processed using either the bioMérieux easyMAG or EMAG
instruments.
Prospectively Collected Specimens (Category I/II)
A total of 1,844 nasopharyngeal swab specimens from five geographically diverse sites in
the United States were initially enrolled in the Prospective Clinical Study between
October 2022 and April 2023. The performance of the NxTAG RPP v2 was compared to
that of an analyte-specific molecular assay for SARS-CoV-2 that was cleared by FDA
under 21 CFR 866.3981 (Product Code QQX) and an FDA-cleared molecular respiratory
panel for all other analytes. Specimens that were reported positive for influenza A H1 by
the comparator method were further characterized by PCR/bidirectional sequencing to
distinguish the pandemic strain A H1pdm09 from other influenza A H1 strains. The
prospectively collected specimens were tested using the NxTAG RPP v2 assay at three
study sites.
Nineteen specimens were excluded from the analysis of performance as follows:
duplicate specimen, not from a unique patient (11), not collected from the intended use
population with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection (5), improper labeling
(2) or NxTAG RPP v2 operator error (1). Nineteen of the remaining 1,825 specimens
(1.0%) produced invalid NxTAG results on initial testing. Sixteen were retested, of which
14 produced valid positive or negative results and 2 were again reported as “invalid”. In
total, 5 specimens (0.3%) were excluded from the analysis of performance due to invalid
NxTAG RPP v2 test results. Additional specimens were also excluded from analysis of
performance for specific analytes due to failure to perform the applicable comparator test
method(s) or generation of invalid comparator test results.
The demographic characteristics of the 1,820 patients from whom specimens with valid
NxTAG RPP v2 results were obtained are provided in Table 36.

Preselected, Archived Specimens (Category III)
For analytes that exhibited low prevalence in the Prospective Clinical Study, 320
preselected, archived specimens that were initially reported as positive based on standard
of care test results were obtained from six sites in the United States. The microbial
content of each specimen was confirmed by PCR/bidirectional sequencing prior to
enrollment in the study. Eleven specimens were excluded from the analysis of
performance because confirmatory testing could not be completed. To avoid bias, testing
of the remaining 309 archived specimens with the NxTAG RPP v2 assay was performed
in a randomized, blinded manner at four study sites without further preselection based on
their microbial content. Three specimens (0.9%) produced invalid NxTAG RPP v2
results on initial testing, of which 2 gave valid positive/negative results upon repeat, for a
final invalid rate of 0.3% (1/309) and a final total of 308 preselected specimens for
inclusion in the analysis of performance.
Contrived Specimens (Category IV)
Positive clinical specimens could not be obtained in sufficient numbers to meet study
requirements for some analytes for which additional testing was performed using
contrived specimens. These were prepared by spiking known analyte-negative individual
clinical specimens in Universal Transport Medium (UTM; Copan Diagnostics) using
previously characterized bacterial or viral stocks of representative strains at 2X, 10X or
100X the established LoD. Testing of the contrived specimens with the NxTAG RPP v2
assay was performed at two study sites in a blinded manner. Results were compared to
the known analyte content of each specimen. On initial testing 1/199 contrived specimens

this specimen upon retest.
Clinical Performance
A summary of the results from testing prospectively collected and archived, preselected
nasopharyngeal swabs is shown in Table 37.
Valid NxTAG RPP v2 test results were obtained from a total of 1,820 prospectively collected
nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) ranged from 90.0-100%
for prospectively collected specimens depending on the analyte, except for Parainfluenza
Virus 4 for which the number of specimens tested was small (n = 15). For archived,
preselected specimens, PPA ranged from 92.3-100%, depending on the analyte.
Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) ranged from 99.7-100% for prospectively collected
specimens and from 99.3-100% for archived specimens.

Contrived Specimens
Because some analytes exhibited low prevalence in the Prospective Clinical Study and
insufficient archived positive specimens were available to demonstrate acceptable positive
agreement, additional testing was performed with contrived specimens that were prepared by
spiking quantified viral or bacterial stocks into unique individual nasopharyngeal swab
specimens that were known to be negative for the NxTAG panel analytes (Table 38). The results
of the study are described in Table 39 and show acceptable positive and negative agreement.
