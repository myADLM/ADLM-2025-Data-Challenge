III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access Myoglobin assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of myoglobin levels in human serum and plasma using the Access
Immunoassay Systems. Measurement of myoglobin aids in the rapid diagnosis of heart and renal
diseases.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Access Myoglobin assay consists of the following:
Well Contents Ingredients
R1a: 3.25 mL Paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-biotin
antibody suspended in MES buffered saline, with bovine
serum albumin (BSA), 0.25% ProClin* 300, and < 0.1%
sodium azide.
R1b: 3.1 mL Mouse monoclonal anti-human myoglobin antibody-
biotin conjugate and mouse monoclonal anti-human
myoglobin antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate in
phosphate buffered saline with BSA, purified mouse
IgG, purified goat IgG, 0.25% ProClin 300, and < 0.1%
sodium azide.
Other items needed to run the assay include the Access Myoglobin reagent packs, Access
Myoglobin Calibrators, along with the UniCel DxI wash buffer II, and Lumi-Phos PRO
substrate. It is intended for use on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer in a clinical
laboratory setting.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access Myoglobin assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay.
A sample is added to a reaction vessel with mouse monoclonal anti-myoglobin-alkaline
phosphatase conjugate, mouse monoclonal anti-myoglobin-biotin conjugate, and paramagnetic
K231832 - Page 2 of 7

--- Page 3 ---
particles coated with goat anti-biotin. Human serum myoglobin binds to the anti-myoglobin
biotin conjugate and is immobilized on paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-biotin
antibody, while the mouse anti-myoglobin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts specifically
with a different antigenic site on the myoglobin molecule.
After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field, while unbound
materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light
generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly
proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically
determined from a stored calibration.

concentrations were tested across two runs per day, over 20 or more days. The study met the
minimum requirement of 80 replicates per sample on each instrument and reagent lot
combination. Three commercial quality controls were run in duplicate on each day to verify
the system was in control.
Results from one representative lot:

2. Linearity:
A study was performed to determine the linearity of the candidate device based on the
recommendations in the CLSI EP06-2nd Edition guideline. Eight lithium heparin samples
ranging from 0.152ng/mL (native) to 4778.10ng/mL were prepared by mixing a high sample
spiked with human myoglobin and a native sample with a low concentration. The low
sample was run in replicates of eight, and all other samples were run in replicates of four.
The study was run using three reagent lots and three calibrator lots. The data were analyzed
using a weighted linear regression model and the deviation from linearity did not exceed
10%. The data supports the claimed reportable range of 3.0ng/L to 400ng/L of myoglobin.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference was reviewed in K021229. The sponsor also provided information to support
that biotin up to 1200 ng/mL does not interfere with the test. The following statement is
included in the labeling. “Specimens that contain biotin at a concentration of ≤ 1,200 ng/mL
demonstrate a less than or equal to 10% change in results. Biotin concentrations greater than
this may lead to incorrect Access Myoglobin results for patient samples.”
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The data provided support the sponsor’s claims that the reportable range of this assay is
3.0ng/mL – 4,000ng/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability was reviewed in k021229.
6. Detection Limit:
Studies were performed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD),
and Limit of Quantitation using protocols based on CLSI EP17-A2. LoB was determined to

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was completed to compare the candidate device compared to the
predicate device using a protocol based on CLSI EP09c-A3. A total of one hundred and
fifty-five (155) lithium heparin plasma samples (11 were contrived with human myoglobin
and 144 were native samples including 15 that were native pools) were evaluated in the
method comparison study.
The study was run on three DxI 9000 instruments and three Access 2 instruments with three
reagent pack lots and three calibrator lots.
The comparison between paired measurements was analyzed by fitting the observed Access
Myoglobin Assay on DxI 9000 instrument (dependent variable, y) into a linear regression
model, with the observed Access Myoglobin Assay on Access 2 values as the only
independent variable (x, predicate) are shown below:

2. Matrix Comparison:
For sample type comparison, two studies were run to compare each of the allowed sample
types (LiHep vs Serum and LiHep vs EDTA). For each study, one DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer was used with one reagent lot and one calibrator lot.
