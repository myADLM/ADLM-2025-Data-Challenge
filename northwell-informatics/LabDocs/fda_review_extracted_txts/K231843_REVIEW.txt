B Principle of Operation:
ARX-VTM maintains cellular integrity and the preservation of viruses when properly stored.
Prior to use, vials should be stored at either 2-8°C or 25-30°C. Once a specimen is collected with
the appropriate swab, it should be placed into the vial containing the transport medium
immediately and processed as soon as possible to achieve optimal recovery. In cases where
immediate processing is not possible, the transport tube containing the specimen can be stored
for up to 72 hours at either 2-8°C or 25-30°C.
The ARX-VTM contains the following ingredients:
• Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS)
• Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)
• Gentamicin
• Amphotericin B
• Phenol red
• Deionized water.
HBBS and FBS provide the nutrients. Gentamicin and Amphotericin B inhibit bacterial and
fungal contamination, respectively. Phenol red functions as a pH indicator.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Not Applicable.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not Applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Shelf Life:
To evaluate Shelf-life, three lots of ARX-VTM samples were tested and visually examined at
every month for real-time aging from 0 to 20 months. The lots of media were stored at 2-8°C
or room temperature (25-30°C). Duplicate samples from each lot were visually inspected for
turbidity (the appearance of the product is expected to be clear (i.e., no turbidity, not cloudy,
and no precipitation)) and maintains a pink color (i.e., no color change from pink to yellow).
The media lots were tested for pH (acceptable range: 7.4 ± 0.4) and osmolarity (acceptable
range: 290 ± 30 mOsm/Kg). All results were acceptable. This and the performance data from
recovery studies do support that ARX-VTM is stable for up to 20 months.
Sterility:
The ARX-VTM tube and media are not sold as sterile nor are they intended to be sterilized
by the user. These vials are single use devices. To minimize contamination, the tubes are
filled aseptically during manufacturing under control conditions. The swabs provided with
the ARX-VTM are individually packaged and are sold as sterile.
6. Detection Limit:
Performance Testing - Recovery Studies:
Performance of the ARX-VTM was evaluated using a culture-based viral recovery study.
Dilutions of the virus stock suspensions for Coronavirus OC43, Cytomegalovirus (CMV),
Echovirus Type 30, Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1), Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2
(HSV-2), Influenza A, Parainfluenza 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) A were
prepared in negative clinical matrix. The matrix was then transferred with the swabs into the
ARX-VTM and held at both 2-8°C and room temperature (25-30°C) for 0, 24, 48, and 72
hours. The inoculum dilution for preparing the contrived virus specimen was predetermined
by demonstrating ~40 to~50% infection via Fluorescent Foci Unit (FFU) after 24-48 hours in
culture. Recovery study was conducted with three variously aged lots (new lot: 0-3 months
old, middle-age lot: 11-12 months old, and old lot: 17 to 19 months old) of 3 ml ARX-VTM.
At the end of each incubation of the swab samples in the ARX-VTM, an aliquot of the
mixture was inoculated into the cell monolayer and incubated for 24-48 hours before the cells
were washed, fixed and immunostained by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled
antibodies for each target virus. The virus titer was determined by visual enumeration of
fluorescent foci units (FFU) of each target virus. Table 2 below exhibits the viral recovery
performance of the ARX-VTM at 2-8°C. Table 3 below exhibits the viral recovery

performance of the ARX-VTM at 25-30°C. Any change of virus titer that was within one log
(+/-90%) from the baseline (time point 0) was considered acceptable.

The viral recovery study data supports the recovery of the above indicated viruses for up to 72
hours from collection when the specimen containing viruses are stored in the ARX-VTM at 2-
8°C or at room temperature (25-30°C).
Based on the overall analysis of viral recovery data, the following statements were added in
the package insert:
1. ARX-VTM was also tested for viral recovery of Adenovirus. However, due to data
irregularities, the data was insufficient to support use of this medium for collection and
storage of specimens for Adenovirus culture or testing.
2. The recovery performance of other viruses beyond the ones tested in the recovery study are
not known.
