B Indication(s) for Use:
The Rapid Fentanyl (FYL) Test Strip is a rapid, screening test for the qualitative detection of
Fentanyl (FYL) in human urine at the cut-off concentration of 1 ng/mL. The tests is intended for
in vitro diagnostics use. It is intended for prescription use including point of care sites. This
assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. To obtain a confirmed analytical result, a
more specific alternative chemical method must be used. Gas Chromatography/ Mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography/Mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any
drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.
The Rapid Fentanyl (FYL) Test Dipcard is a rapid, screening test for the qualitative detection of

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Rapid Fentanyl (FYL) Test Strip and Rapid Fentanyl (FYL) Test Dipcard are competitive
binding, lateral flow immunochromatographic assays for qualitatively the detection of fentanyl at
or above the cut-off concentration of 1 ng/mL. Test Strip and Test Dipcard use identical test
strips made with same chemical formulation and manufacturing procedures.
Content of the kit:
Test Strip, one test in one pouch or Test Dipcard, one test in one pouch.
Desiccant. The desiccant is only for storage purposes only and is not used in the test procedures.
Leaflet with instructions for use.
B Principle of Operation:
The Rapid Fentanyl (FYL) Test Strip is a competitive immunoassay that is used to screen for the
presence of Fentanyl and metabolites in urine. It is chromatographic absorbent device in which,
drugs within a urine sample, competitively combined to a limited number of drug monoclonal
antibody (mouse) conjugate binding sites.
When the test is activated, the urine is absorbed into test strip by capillary action, mixes with the
respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate, and flows across a pre-coated membrane. When
drug within the urine sample is below the detection level of the test, respective drug monoclonal
K231904 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
antibody conjugate binds to the respective drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region
(T) of the test strip. This produces a colored Test line in the Test Region (T) of the strip, which,
regardless of its intensity, indicates a negative test result.
When sample drug levels are at or above the detection level of the test, the free drug in the
sample binds to the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate, preventing the respective
drug monoclonal antibody conjugate from binding to the respective drug-protein conjugate
immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This prevents the development of a distinct
colored band in the test region, indicating a preliminary positive result.
To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C), of each
strip, if the test has been performed properly.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using 3 lots of test Strip and test Dipcard. Drug free
specimens were spiked with target drug fentanyl at 0, ±75% cutoff, ±50% cutoff, ±25%
cutoff and +100% cutoff of drug. The concentrations of the target drugs were confirmed with
LC/MS. Each concentration of the urine specimen was divided into aliquots. Each aliquot
was blindly labeled by a nonparticipant. Separate sets of blinded coded samples were
assigned and randomized prior to testing. The study was conducted by 6 operators/nurses at 3
Point-of-Care sites. Two operators per location tested 3 aliquots at each concentration for
each lot per day (3 runs/day) for 10 non-consecutive days using one device lot per location.
One operator tested the test strip format, and the second operator tested the test dipcard
format. There were 1620 observations by 3 sites at 9 concentrations.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable, this device is intended for qualitative use only
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross Reactivity:
The sponsor performed a study to verify potential cross-reactants using the target drug, drug
metabolites, and other related compounds. The target drugs, drug metabolites and other
components that are likely to interfere in urine samples were added to drug-free urine specimens
at a concentration of 100µg/ml. The study was conducted by 8 laboratory professionals. Two
Laboratory professionals spiked the compound controls and divided them into individual
containers, the other 6 laboratory professionals conducted the testing using the instructions for
use package insert. Each sample was tested in 3 replicates using 3 lots of Rapid Fentanyl (FYL)
Test Strip and the same protocol for Rapid Fentanyl (FYL) Test Dipcard. One operator
conducted each individual lot (and product type; strip and dipcard) separately.
The formula for calculating the percent of cross-reactivity was calculated by dividing the cutoff
concentration by the minimum concentration required to obtain a positive result and then
multiplying by 100%. The lowest concentration that caused a positive result for each compound
are listed below for both the Rapid Fentanyl (FYL) Test Strip and the same protocol for Rapid
Fentanyl (FYL) Dipcard:
