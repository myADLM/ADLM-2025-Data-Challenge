IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys PTH and Elecsys PTH STAT immunoassays has been updated to account for biotin
remediation by incorporating a biotinylated monoclonal PTH-specific antibody labeled with a
ruthenium complex.
Each Rack Pack of PTH or PTH STAT reagent consists of the following:
-M Streptavidin coated microparticles (transparent cap), 1 bottle, 6.5 mL: Streptavidin coated
microparticles 0.72 mg/mL; preservative.
-R1 Anti PTH Ab~biotin (gray cap), 1 bottle, 7 mL: Biotinylated monoclonal anti PTH antibody
(mouse) 2.3 mg/L; phosphate buffer 100 mmol/L, pH 7.0; preservative.
-R2 Anti PTH Ab~Ru(bpy) (black cap), 1 bottle, 7 mL: Monoclonal anti PTH antibody (mouse)
labeled with ruthenium complex 2.0 mg/L; phosphate buffer 100 mmol/L, pH 7.0; preservative.
B Principle of Operation:
The Elecsys PTH Assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin microparticles and
electrochemiluminescence detection. In the first incubation,50 μL of sample, a biotinylated
monoclonal PTH‑specific antibody, and monoclonal PTH‑specific antibody labeled with a
ruthenium complex form a sandwich complex. In the second incubation, after the addition of
streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction
of biotin and streptavidin. It requires 50 μL of sample. Results are determined using a calibration
curve that is generated specifically on each instrument by a 2 point calibration and a master curve
provided with the reagent bar code. The assay time is 18 minutes.

The Elecsys PTH STAT Assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin
microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. A biotinylated monoclonal PTH‑specific
antibody, a monoclonal PTH‑specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex and
streptavidin‑coated microparticles react to form a sandwich complex, which is bound to the solid
phase. It requires 50 μL of sample. Results are determined using a calibration curve that is
generated specifically on each instrument by a 2 point calibration and a master curve provided
with the reagent bar code. The assay time is 9 minutes.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability (within-run precision) and intermediate precision (within-laboratory precision)
were evaluated following the recommendations in the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline.
Repeatability:
A repeatability study was performed using five pooled serum samples and three controls
(PreciControl Varia indicated by PC V0, PC V1 and PC V2) with concentrations spanning the
measuring range. Samples were tested in duplicate using 2 runs per day over 21 days for a total
of 84 replicates per sample on one cobas e 601 analyzer, using one reagent lot for each assay.

Reproducibility
A reproducibility study was conducted using six serum pools and three control levels. Samples
were measured at three sites (one internal and two external sites). Samples with a concentration
greater than 2000 pg/mL were spiked with human PTH (1-84). At the external sites, a single
reagent lot was used to assay samples. At the internal site, three reagent lots were used to assay
samples. At each site, samples were assayed using the cobas e 601 analyzer over five days, one
run per day, 5 replicates per run. The between lot, between day, and reproducibility results are
shown in the tables below:

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was performed in accordance with the CLSI EP06-Second Edition
guideline. High and low serum sample pools were intermixed to create samples that
contained human PTH with concentrations that ranged from 4.18 to 5635 pg/mL for the
Elecsys PTH Immunoassay and from 3.83- 5517 pg/mL for the Elecsys PTH STAT
Immunoassay. Each sample was tested in quadruplicate. Reported differences (i.e., absolute
and % relative deviation from linearity) were calculated by Weight Variance (WLS). The
results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 6‑5000 pg/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
An endogenous and exogenous interference study was performed in accordance with the
CLSI EP07-A3 guideline. Human serum specimen pools with native analyte were
supplemented with potentially interfering compounds at levels listed in the table below. PTH
analyte levels of approximately 15 pg/mL, 60 pg/mL, 2000-2500 pg/mL, and 3000-3500
pg/mL were tested. The sponsor provided information to support the following claims:

PTH 1-37, ≤0.1% for PTH related protein (rP) (1-86), and >50% for PTH 7-84. The % cross-

The sponsor included the following limitation in their labeling:
“For assays using antibodies, the possibility exists for interference by heterophile
antibodies in the patient’s sample. Patients who have been regularly exposed to animals
or have received immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures using immunoglobulin or
immunoglobulin fragments may produce antibodies (e.g. human anti-mouse antibodies,
or HAMA) that can interfere with immunoassays.
The Elecsys PTH STAT assay may be affected by HAMA interference. In cases in which
samples contain HAMA, a positive bias may be observed. In an internal study, the
following biases were seen: for HAMA levels up to approximately 30 ng/mL, +15 % at a
low PTH concentration (10 pg/mL PTH), no effect on higher PTH concentrations

(approximately 60 pg/mL and 3000 pg/mL); for HAMA levels between approximately
50‑1000 ng/mL up to
8‑fold increase at a low PTH concentration (10 pg/mL PTH) and 2‑fold increase at a
higher PTH concentration (approximately 60 pg/mL PTH). No effect was observed at
approximately 3000 pg/mL PTH. Carefully evaluate the results of patients suspected of
having these antibodies.
For diagnostic purposes, the results should always be assessed in conjunction with the
patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.”
High Dose Hook Effect:
For the Elecsys PTH and Elecsys PTH STAT immunoassays, assessed on one cobas e 601
analyzer, no high dose effect was observed for samples containing approximately 17,000
pg/mL PTH.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See section VII.A.2 Linearity.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Performance established in K070709 and K992680.
6. Detection Limit:
The sponsor provided detection limits studies following CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
Limit of Blank (LoB):
The LoB was determined by testing three reagent lots on one cobas e 601 analyzer, with six
runs over three days with one blank sample with ten replicates per run. The zero-level (blank)
sample used was a depleted human serum sample pool and 60 measurements were analyzed.
LoB was based on the determination of the 95th percentile of the 60 measured values. The
claimed LoB for the Elecsys PTH immunoassay and PTH STAT immunoassay is 1.2 pg/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
The LoD was determined by testing five serum samples containing low levels of PTH with
three reagent lots on one cobas e 601 analyzer. Samples were run in two replicates per run,
six runs over multiple days. The LoD was calculated based on LoD = LoB + 1.653 x SD
(total of low analyte samples) and defined as the lowest concentration at which there is a
95% probability that a sample contains analyte. The claimed LoD for Elecsys PTH
immunoassay and PTH STAT immunoassay is 2.4 pg/mL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ):
The LoQ for the Elecsys PTH immunoassay was determined by testing eight low level serum
samples measured in five-fold determinations on one cobas e 601 analyzer with one run per
day over five days using three reagent lots. The LoQ for the Elecsys PTH STAT immunoassay
was determined by testing six low-level human serum samples measured in five-fold
determinations on one cobas e 601 analyzer with one run per day over five days using three
reagent lots. The LoQ for both immunoassays was defined as the lowest analyte concentration
that can be reproducibly measured with an intermediate precision CV of ≤ 20 % and was
determined to be 6 pg/mL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the results of the Elecsys PTH and
PTH STAT immunoassays (candidate immunoassays) to the Elecsys PTH and PTH STAT
immunoassays (predicate immunoassays), respectively. The samples tested ranged from 6.16
to 4751 pg/mL for the Elecsys PTH Immunoassay and 10.3- 4532 pg/mL for the Elecsys
PTH STAT Immunoassay. The data analysis was conducted using weighted Deming
regression analysis and results are summarized in the following tables:
