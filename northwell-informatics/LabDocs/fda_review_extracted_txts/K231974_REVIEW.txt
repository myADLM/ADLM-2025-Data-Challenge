III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
PATHFAST®hs-cTnI-II is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of cardiac
Troponin I (cTnl) in heparinized or EDTA whole blood and plasma. Measurements of cardiac
Troponin I are used as an aid in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
PATHFAST® hs-cTnI-II is for use in clinical laboratory or point of care (POC) settings.

Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline

Approved Guideline
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Previously established in K100130.
2. Linearity:
Linearity studies using EDTA and lithium heparin whole blood and plasma samples were
designed and analyzed following the recommendations in the Guideline CLSI EP6 2nd
Edition: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures.
EDTA whole blood and plasma samples, and lithium heparin whole blood and plasma
samples with low and high cTnI values were mixed to produce up to 12 levels with
concentrations ranging from 1 to 64,500 ng/L. Three dilution series of each sample matrix
were prepared and tested with three different lots of reagents (one lot for each dilution
series). Each level was tested in replicates of three. The maximum deviation from linearity
observed in the study across all sample matrices was 9.7%.

The studies support that the device is linear from 4.1 to 50,000 ng/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Previously established in K100130.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The measuring range of the PATHFAST hs-cTnI-II is from 4.1 ng/L to 50,000 ng/L.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Unchanged from K100130.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by testing four lots of reagents and four blank
samples. The limit of detection (LoD) for EDTA and lithium heparin whole blood and
plasma was determined by testing 4 low level samples and four lots of reagents for each
sample matrix.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) study was conducted using EDTA and lithium heparin whole
blood and plasma samples at concentrations expected to be around the proposed LoQ. The
LoQ was determined by testing six samples per sample type and two reagent lots.
The LoB was calculated using the classical approach using nonparametric analysis as described
in CLSI EP17-A2 Evaluation of Detection Capability for Clinical Laboratory Measurement
Procedures. The LoD was calculated per the classical approach using parametric analysis as
described in the CLSI EP17-A2 Guideline. The LoQ was determined based on a precision
performance goal of less than 20 % CV.
The results of the study support the assay LoQ of 4.1 ng/L.
