IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BioSieve™ Marijuana Test Panel (Strip) and the BioSieve™ Dx Marijuana Test Panel
(Strip) tests are immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for the qualitative
detection of Marijuana in human urine. The products are single-use in vitro diagnostic devices.
Each test kit contains a Test Device and a package insert. Each test device is sealed with a
desiccant in an aluminum pouch.
B Principle of Operation:
The BioSieve™ Marijuana Test Panel and the BioSieve™ Marijuana Test Strip tests are rapid
tests for the qualitative detection of marijuana in urine samples. They are lateral flow
chromatographic immunoassays. When urine sample is added to the device, urine is absorbed
into the test strip and migrates upwards by capillary action. If the concentration of target drug
K231978 - Page 3 of 13

--- Page 4 ---
presented in the urine sample is below the cutoff level, the target drug will not saturate the
binding sites of its specific monoclonal antibody-coated particles. The antibody-coated particles
will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored band will be formed
on the test line region. If the concentration of target is beyond the cutoff level, the target drug
will saturate the binding sites of its specific monoclonal antibody-particles, thus the antibody-
coated particles will not be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate hence no colored band will
be formed on the test line region. A band should be formed on the control line region regardless
of the presence of target drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been
performed properly.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cut off, -75%
cut off, - 50% cut off, -25% cut off, cutoff, +25% cut off, +50% cut off, +75% cut off and
+100% cut off at three different testing sites. Samples with concentration of -100% cutoff
were drug-free urine samples. Other samples were prepared by spiking 11-Nor- 9-THC-9-
COOH in drug-free urine samples. Each 11-Nor- 9-THC-9-COOH concentration was
confirmed by LC/MS. For each concentration, tests were performed on two runs△ per day at
each site for each lot for 10 days. The results obta△ined are summarized in the following

2. Linearity:
Not applicable. Devices are intended for qualitative determination only.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a) Specificity Study
To test the specificity, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to cross-react in
urine samples were spiked into drug-free urine. These urine samples were tested using three lots
of each format of the BioSieve™ Marijuana Test Panel and the BioSieve™ Marijuana Test Strip.
Percent cross-reactivity, provided in the below table, was calculated as the cutoff concentration
divided by the concentration of analyte tested that yielded a positive result, multiplied by 100;
compounds that did not yield a positive result at the highest concentration tested have relative
cross reactivity results represented by a dash in the table below:

b) Interfering substances study
Potential interfering substances were added to drug-free urine sample and samples with target
drugs at -25% cutoff and +25% cutoff levels and tested with both the 50ng/mL cut-off strip
and panel devices. Potential interfering substances were added to drug-free urine sample and
samples with target drugs at -50% cutoff and +50% cutoff levels and tested with both the
20ng/mL cut-off strip and panel devices. Compounds that show no interference at a
concentration of 100μg/mL (albumin was tested at 100 mg/dL and ethanol was tested at 1%)
are listed below.

c) Effect of Urine Density
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity, urine samples with specific gravity from
1.000 to 1.035 were spiked with target drug at +25% cutoff and -25% cutoff levels for the 50
ng/mL cut-off test strip and test panel devices. And the same urine specific gravity samples
were spiked with target drug at +50% cutoff and -50% cutoff levels for the 20 ng/mL cutoff
test strip and test panel devices. Three operators tested each sample using test devices from
three different lots. The results were all positive for samples at +25% cutoff or +50% cutoff
and all negative for samples at -25% cutoff or -50% cutoff, indicating that urine specific
gravity between 1.000 and 1.035 does not interfere with device performance.
d) Effect of Urine pH
To investigate the effect of urine pH, urine samples with pH value from 4 to 9 were spiked
with target drug at +25% cutoff and -25% cutoff levels for the 50 ng/mL cut-off test strip and
test panel devices. And the same urine pH samples were spiked with target drug at +50% cut-
off and -50% cutoff levels for the 20 ng/mL cut-off test strip and test panel devices. Three
operators tested each sample using test devices from three different lots. The results were all
positive for samples at +25% or +50% cutoff and all negative for samples at -25% or -50%

cut-off, indicating that urine pH values between 4.0 and 9.0 do not interfere with device
performance.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable. The devices are intended for qualitative determinations only.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The devices are traceable to a commercial reference standard material.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
For characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentrations, please refer to section VII.A.1 and VII. B.1.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison studies for all device configurations were performed with six
operators at 3 sites. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered urine samples.
Three different lots of devices were used for both the strip and panel format, one for each
site. Two different operators at each site used either the strip or panel format. The samples
were blind labeled and compared to LC/MS results. The results are presented in the table
below:

Read Time
To investigate the effect of read time, urine samples were spiked with target drug at -100%
cutoff, -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff, +25% cutoff, and +50% cutoff and were sampled at
different reading times of 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes for the 50 ng/mL cut-off test panel and
test strip devices. For the 20ng/mL cut-off test panel and test strip devices, urine samples
were spiked with target drug at -100% cutoff, -50% cutoff, and +50% cutoff and were
sampled at different reading times of 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes. Three operators tested each
sample using test devices from three different lots. The results were all negative at -100%
cutoff, -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff and all positive at +25% cutoff, and +50% cutoff levels for
all read times evaluated.

Lay-user study:
A lay user study was performed at three sites (2 Health Service Centers, 1 Hospital) with 280
lay persons. The 280 aliquots were equally distributed to the three testing sites where one
person tested one sample. The lay users had diverse educational and professional
backgrounds and ranged in age from 18 to > 50 years. Urine samples were prepared at the
following concentrations; negative, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the 50 ng/mL cutoff by
spiking 11-Nor- 9-THC-9-COOH into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The
concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into
individual conta△iners and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package
insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. Summary results are shown below.
