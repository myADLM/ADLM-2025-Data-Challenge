III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The TEG 6s Hemostasis System consists of the TEG 6s Hemostasis Analyzer and the Citrated:
K, KH, RTH, FFH assay cartridge. The TEG 6s Hemostasis System is intended for in vitro
diagnostic use with adult patients where an evaluation of their blood hemostasis properties is
desired. The TEG 6s Hemostasis System records the kinetic changes in a sample of 3.2%
citrated whole blood as the sample clots and provides semi-quantitative results. The TEG 6s
Hemostasis System can be used in the laboratory or at the point-of-care.
The Citrated: K, KH, RTH, FFH assay cartridge is intended to be used in patients where
heparin/heparinoids may be present and who are at an increased risk of coagulopathy.
Hemostasis evaluations are indicated to assess clinical conditions in cardiovascular surgery,
cardiovascular procedures (e.g., minimally invasive valve replacement or repairs) and liver
transplantation to assess hemorrhage or thrombosis conditions before, during and following the
procedure.
The Citrated: K, KH, RTH, FFH assay cartridge contains four independent assays (CK, CKH,
CRTH and CFFH) and the system output consists of a table of numerical values for parameters
R, MA, and LY30.
The CK assay monitors the hemostasis process via the intrinsic pathway in 3.2% citrated whole
blood specimens on the TEG 6s Hemostasis System. Clotting characteristics are described by the
functional parameters R (clotting time) and MA (maximum clot strength).
The CKH assay monitors the effects of heparin in 3.2% citrated whole blood specimens on the
TEG 6s Hemostasis System. CKH is used in conjunction with CK, and heparin influence is
determined by comparing Clotting Times (R) between the two tests. LY30 describes fibrinolysis
30 minutes after reaching maximum clot strength.
The CRTH assay monitors the hemostasis process after stimulation of both the intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways in 3.2% citrated whole blood specimens on the TEG 6s Hemostasis System,
neutralizing the effect of heparin in the sample. Clotting characteristics are described by the
functional parameter MA (maximum clot strength with contributions of both platelets and
fibrin).
The CFFH assay monitors hemostasis of 3.2% citrated whole blood specimens in the TEG 6s
Hemostasis System after blocking platelet contributions to clot strength, neutralizing the effect of
heparin in the sample. Clotting characteristics are described by the functional parameter MA
(fibrinogen contribution to maximum clot strength).
Results from the TEG 6s analysis should not be the sole basis for a patient diagnosis, but should
be evaluated together with the patient's medical history, the clinical picture and, if necessary,
further hemostasis tests.

TEG 6s Hemostasis Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The TEG 6s Hemostasis System (TEG 6s Hemostasis Analyzer and the Citrated: K, KH, RTH,
FFH assay cartridge) are used to test the hemostasis properties of citrated blood samples using
four different assays/reagents simultaneously, one in each of the four cartridge channels. The
TEG 6s Hemostasis System is designed to monitor and analyze the coagulation state of blood
samples using thromboelastography technology. Thromboelastography has been utilized to
understand the hemostatic balance that should exist between the extremes of coagulopathy
(impaired clot formation, hypocoagulable) and thrombosis (formation of a blood clot obstructing
the flow of blood, hypercoagulable). The TEG 6s analyzer records the kinetic changes in a whole
blood sample as the sample clots, retracts and/or lyses. The system output consists of numerical
values for each of the four cartridge channels resulting from the hemostasis process over time.
For the CK assay, Kaolin-activated test methods are used to reduce variability and to reduce the
running time of a native whole blood sample. CKH is similar to CK but with the addition of
heparinase, to neutralize the effects of heparin in the blood. If there is heparin present, the R time
for CK will be significantly longer than the R time for CKH. The CRTH assay neutralizes the
anticoagulant property of heparin and maximally accelerates the clotting process by
simultaneously activating the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways, allowing for the
maximum clot strength to be reached more quickly. The CFFH assay neutralizes the
anticoagulant property of heparin and inhibits platelet aggregation, excluding its contribution to
clot strength, and thereby measures fibrinogen contribution to clot strength.
B Principle of Operation:
The TEG 6s technology is based on the use of Citrated K, KH, RTH, FFH disposable cartridge
containing up to 4 independent measurement cells. Each cell consists of a short vertically
oriented injection molded tube (ring). Detection of clotting in the TEG 6s Hemostasis System is
performed optically. A piezoelectric actuator vibrates the measurement cell(s) through a motion
profile composed of summed sinusoids at different frequencies. The movement of the
measurement cells will induce motion in the sample meniscus, which will be detected by a
photodiode. The resulting motion of the meniscus is monitored optically and analyzed by the
instrument to calculate the resonant frequency and modulus of elasticity (stiffness) of the sample.
By performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on meniscus motion data, the resonant
frequencies can be determined. The analyzer monitors the harmonic motion of a hanging drop of
blood in response to external vibration. As the sample transitions from a liquid state to a gel-like
state during clotting, the modulus of elasticity (stiffness) and therefore resonant frequency
K232018 - Page 3 of 19

--- Page 4 ---
increase. The TEG 6s hemostasis analyzer measures these variations in resonant frequency
during clotting and lysis.
Resonance is the tendency of a material or structure to oscillate with greater amplitude at
some frequencies than others. The exact frequencies at which resonance occurs will depend on
the stiffness and mass of the sample. Stiffness, in turn, is a function of a material’s modulus of
elasticity and the boundary conditions to which the material is exposed, such as the geometry
and materials of a test cell. By holding these boundary conditions and sample mass constant
from sample to sample, the TEG 6s Hemostasis System allows direct comparison of elasticity
between samples. The output measurements are displayed in a table and on a graphical tracing
that reflects the hemostasis profile of the clot formation.
In a typical test, blood that has been delivered to the measurement cell will not clot for several
minutes. During this time the sample has no inherent stiffness except that provided by surface
tension, and since this remains constant the measured resonant frequencies will not change. Once
clotting begins, however, the elastic modulus and thus the resonant frequencies increase rapidly.
During fibrinolysis, the process is reversed, with elastic modulus and resonant frequencies
decreasing. In tests where clotting does not occur, the resonant frequency of the sample will not
change. During coagulation, however, a clot will bind to the ring contained in the cartridge and
the resonant frequency will rise with increasing firmness of the clot. The analyzer collects
meniscus motion data, tracks changing resonant frequencies and analyzes the frequency data to
provide semi-quantitative parameters describing the clot. The System monitors the interaction of
platelets within the fibrin mesh of the clot during clot formation and lysis, all in a whole-blood
setting. The TEG 6s Hemostasis System uses thromboelastography to provide continuous
measurement of clot elasticity.
CK Principle
Kaolin is a standardized reagent consisting of dry Kaolin and 0.85% Saline solution. Kaolin-
activated test methods are used to reduce variability and to reduce the running time of a native
whole blood sample. Use of these particles of hydrated aluminum silicate shortens coagulation
time because Kaolin acts as a contact surface activator (intrinsic pathway), which activates
Factor XII and platelets and stimulates the reserve clotting ability of a blood sample. Kaolin is
combined with CaCl to neutralize any sodium citrate in the blood.
2
CKH Principle
Heparin is commonly used as an anticoagulant in surgical procedures. Even very low
concentrations of heparin, fractions of IU/mL of blood, can noticeably increase the R time and
can even completely anticoagulate the blood, making it difficult if not impossible to monitor
developing coagulopathies that are masked by high levels of therapeutic heparin. The addition of
heparinase in the assay cartridge neutralizes the effects of heparin in the sample. CaCl is

included to neutralize any sodium citrate in the blood.
CRTH Principle
RapidTEG maximally accelerates the clotting process by simultaneously activating the intrinsic
and extrinsic coagulation pathways using a high concentration of Kaolin and Tissue Factor (TF).
This closely reflects the physiological clotting process and yields results significantly faster than
a native, Kaolin, and/or TF activated test. The addition of heparinase in the assay cartridge
neutralizes the effects of heparin in the sample. CaCl is included to neutralize any sodium citrate
2
in the blood.
K232018 - Page 4 of 19

--- Page 5 ---
CFFH Principle
The Functional Fibrinogen reagent activates the extrinsic pathway using tissue factor and inhibits
platelet aggregation using a platelet inhibitor that binds to GPIIb/IIIa receptors. By excluding the
platelet aggregation contribution to clot strength (MA), the reagent measures fibrinogen
contribution. The addition of heparinase in the assay cartridge neutralizes the effects of heparin
in the sample. Functional Fibrinogen is combined with CaCl to neutralize any sodium citrate in
2
the blood. Determining the independent contribution of platelets and fibrinogen further improves
the use of the TEG 6s System in helping to detect and diagnose hemostasis defects.

Repeatability – 20-day precision:
A precision study was conducted based on the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline for an assessment of
the Citrated: K, KH, RTH, FFH assay cartridge repeatability utilizing the TEG 6s Cartridge
Reagent Quality Control (QC) material. Two levels of QC material were tested (Level 1 and
2) with a single lot of Citrated: K, KH, RTH, FFH assay cartridges at a single site with two
TEG 6s hemostasis analyzers (one analyzer per QC Level). One trained operator performed
two runs per day with two replicates per run for 20 days. To demonstrate precision
performance for both levels of QC, the mean, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of
variation (%CV) for each component of variability were calculated including repeatability,
between-run, between-day, and within laboratory. The determination of acceptability was
based on the SD or %CV.

Lot-to-Lot Precision Study
A lot-to-lot precision study was performed at one internal site using three lots of Citrated: K,
KH, RTH, FFH assay cartridges and two lots of Cartridge Reagent QC Level 1 and Level 2.
Testing was performed by two trained operators using six different TEG 6s hemostasis
analyzers over 10 days. To demonstrate precision performance for both levels of QC, the
mean, SD and %CV for each component of variability were calculated including
repeatability, between-day, between-operator, between-QC Lot, between-Cartridge Lot, and
within-laboratory. The determination of acceptability was based on the SD or %CV.

Whole Blood Repeatability
A whole blood repeatability study was conducted using whole blood samples under the
following conditions: normal, contrived hypocoagulable (low CFFH MA, low CRTH MA),
hypercoagulable (high CRTH MA and High CKH LY30) and hyperfibrinolytic (High CKH
LY30). All sample conditions were analyzed by two trained operators using three lots of
Citrated: K, KH, RTH, FFH assay cartridges with two replicates per run. Normal whole
blood samples were tested in one day with two operators testing three cartridge lots on two
different TEG 6s hemostasis analyzers with two replicates per run (n=24). Due to sample
stability limitations for contrived samples (hypocoagulable, hypercoagulable, and
hyperfibrinolytic), testing was completed in one day by two operators using three cartridge
lots on four analyzers for one replicate (n=24). To demonstrate precision performance for all
sample types, the mean, SD and %CV for each component of variability were calculated
including repeatability, between-operator, between-lot, between device (normal sample type
only), and within-laboratory. The determination of acceptability was based on the SD or
%CV.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Shelf-Life Stability Study
To establish the shelf-life stability of the Citrated: K, KH, RTH, FFH assay cartridge, a real-
time stability study is designed following CLSI EP25-A. The shelf-life stability study
includes three cartridge lots stored at 2–8℃ and cartridges are taken out for evaluation at 0,
12, 18, 24 and 26.5 months. Cartridges are tested using 3.2% sodium citrate samples using 16
cartridges at each sample condition. Sample conditions include unspiked donor whole blood
and donor whole blood spiked with 5 IU/mL Heparin. The cartridges were tested at time zero
(T0) and lot one was tested after the transport stability study (day 93). Cartridge stability will
be assessed through regression analysis of the individual value difference from T0 compared
to each sample type and assay parameter in accordance with CLSI EP25-A. Shelf-life
cartridge stability studies are on-going.
Transport Stability Study
The transport simulation study was performed with one lot of Citrated: K, KH, RTH, FFH
assay cartridge to simulate transport under stressed conditions. To create the stressed
condition, cartridges were exposed to an extended seven-day International Safe Transit
Association (ISTA) 7-day shipping conditions (5°C for 24 hours (Preconditioning), 22°C for
4 hours, 35°C for 6 hours, 30°C for 152 hours, and 35°C for 6 hours). The measured drift for

each testing time point and condition was compared to the mean level obtained at T0 (time
0). All results were within the acceptable allowable drift. The cartridges passed transport
stability testing and demonstrate the cartridges are robust. The one lot of cartridges used in
the Shelf-Life Stability Study and Cartridge In-Use Stability Study were the lot tested in the
Transport Stability Study to demonstrate the real-world use scenario.
Cartridge In-Use Stability Study
To support a 2 hour in-use stability of the Citrated: K, KH, RTH, FFH assay cartridge, three
lots of cartridges were tested at T0 and 2.5 hours after removal from packaging. Sodium
citrated whole blood collected from normal donors were tested on 10 cartridges and 1 IU/mL
Heparin Spiked Blood and 7 IU/mL Heparin Spiked Blood were tested on 18 cartridges each.
The results from each assay were compared to the control measurements at T0. The data
support the cartridge can be stable after removal from the sealed cartridge pouch for up to 2
hours at ambient room temperature (20–22°C) and humidity (<50%).
Whole Blood Sample Stability Study
A whole blood sample stability study was conducted to support the stability of whole blood
samples collected in 3.2% sodium citrate tubes after 10 minutes of incubation and up to 2
hours of storage at ambient room temperature (20–22°C). Samples were tested at T0 (as soon
as practical post draw), 10 (incubation time point prior to assay start), 66, 99, and 132
minutes. A total of six donor samples per sample type were tested in six replicates per time
point. The sample types used included normal, hypocoaguable, hypercoagulable, and
hyperfibrinolytic whole blood. Replicates were executed simultaneously using six TEG 6s
hemostasis Analyzers. All Citrated: K, KH, RTH, FFH reported parameters (CK-R, CK-MA,
CKH-R, CKH-LY30, CRTH-MA, and CFFH-MA) were evaluated. Results of the study
support the use of whole blood collected in 3.2% sodium citrate tubes up to two hours after
collection and following a 10-minute incubation after collection.

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison study was performed at eight clinical sites in the United States,
comparing to the TEG 6s hemostasis analyzers with the Citrated Multichannel Cartridge
(K150041) and STA - Fibrinogen 5 (K840211). The study enrolled 338 patients (145 females
and 192 males), 18 years of age or older who are at an increased risk of coagulopathy.
Enrolled subjects were patients undergoing liver transplantation, cardiovascular surgery, or
cardiology procedures. Blood samples were drawn before, during, and after the procedures
and analyzed by 24 trained operators.
To support the use of the CKH-MA and CKH-LY30 parameters in the Citrated Multichannel

To define the sensitivity and specificity for the CK channel, blood samples were collected
from four normal donors to establish hypocoagulable, hypercoagulable and hyperfibrinolytic
conditions. Four Levels – including baseline of citrated whole blood samples spiked with
increasing concentration of heparin (0, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.20 IU/mL) were tested with five
TEG 6s Citrated: K, KH, RTH, FFH assay cartridges for a total of 20 cartridges per run.
All hypo-coagulable, hyper-coagulable and hyper-fibrinolytic samples without
heparin showed 100% specificity and all samples spiked at 0.2 IU/ml showed 100%
sensitivity for the detection of heparin.

Heparin Neutralization Requirement Verification
A study was performed to validate the use of heparinase to neutralize the effect of heparin in
blood samples. Tests were performed using Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) and Low
Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) spiked samples and un-spiked samples. A total of 200
cartridges were tested across whole blood samples collected in 3.2% sodium citrate tubes
from four donors in 10 replicates. The mean result per test specimen condition fell within the
respective normal reference range for CRTH-MA, CFFH-MA, CKH-R, and CKH-LY30 for
all donors. The study verified the defined heparin neutralization performance requirements:
• The CKH, CRTH, and CFFH assays shall be able to neutralize up to 5.0 IU/mL (+/-
0.1IU/mL) of heparin.
• The CKH, CRTH, and CFFH assays shall be able to neutralize up to 0.013 mg/mL
(+/- 0.001 mg/mL) of LMWH.
The tolerance interval (95% confidence for 90% of the population) calculated for CFFH-MA,
and CRTH-MA for all specimen types fell within the respective normal reference range. The
study acceptance criteria were met and has verified the following heparin neutralization
performance requirements:
• Blood treated with 5.0 IU/ml (+/- 0.1IU/mL) of heparin, measured CFFH-MA, shall
remain within the normal reference range, 90% of the time.
• Blood treated with 5.0 IU/ml (+/- 0.1IU/mL), measured CRTH-MA, shall remain
within the normal reference range, 90% of the time.
For all 0.008 mg/mL LMWH contrived samples, the CK-R value was greater than the CKH-
R value. The study acceptance criteria were met and has verified the following heparin
neutralization performance requirement for the LMWH sample condition:
• CK-R shall be greater than CKH-R when at least 0.2 IU/mL of heparin or at least
0.008 mg/mL LMWH is present in the blood sample.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The reference ranges for the Citrated: K, KH, RTH, FFH assay cartridge parameters were
established according to CLSI EP28-A3c. The study included 164 apparently healthy individuals
(84 males and 80 female), greater than 18 years old with no known coagulopathies and not
taking any drugs that would potentially affect patient hemostasis. The non-parametric method for
analysis was used to determine the reference range for each assay parameter. The following table
contains the reference range data for each parameter.
Parameter N Range
CK-R (min) 157 4.6–9.1
CK-MA (mm) 151 52–69
CKH-R (min 155 4.3–8.3
CKH-LY30 (%) 148 0–3.2
