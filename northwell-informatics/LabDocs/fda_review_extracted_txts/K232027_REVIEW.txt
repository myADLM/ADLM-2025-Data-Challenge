IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The CAPI 3 NEONAT Hb kit is intended for the detection of normal hemoglobins (F and A) and
abnormal hemoglobins (S, C, E, D and Bart’s) in blood from human newborns collected on filter
paper. The resulting electrophoregrams are automatically evaluated for pattern abnormalities
with identification of normal and pathological patterns.
The CAPI 3 NEONAT Hb kit consists of one CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN(E) buffer, an
alkaline buffer (pH 9.4) supplied in three vials, 700 mL each per kit, Filters - five per kit, and
CAPILLARYS 3 DBS MICROPLATES - one pack barcoded 96-well microplates consisting of
10 microplates.
K232027 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
The CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instrument has silica capillaries functioning in parallel allowing 12
simultaneous analyses. The CAPILLARYS 3 DBS performs all sequences automatically to
obtain a complete hemoglobin profile for the qualitative analysis of hemoglobins. The assay is
performed on the hemolysate of whole blood samples previously collected on Guthrie filter
paper and punched to obtain a paper circle.
Reagents required to perform the CAPI 3 NEONAT Hb kit on CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instrument
but are not supplied in the CAPI 3 NEONAT Hb kit include, CAPI 3 NEONAT Hemolysing
solution kit, CAPI 3 NEONAT Hb AF control, CAPILLARYS 3 CAPICLEAN, CAPILLARYS
3 wash solution.
B Principle of Operation:
The CAPI 3 NEONAT Hb kit is intended for the detection of normal hemoglobins (F and A) and
abnormal hemoglobins (S, C, E, D and Bart’s) in dried blood samples from newborns collected
on filter paper. The samples are eluted from the filter paper into microplates.
The CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instrument performs fully automated electrophoresis sequencing on
the hemolysate of whole blood samples previously collected on Guthrie filter paper and punched
to obtain a paper circle collected in microplates. The CAPI 3 NEONAT Hb kit in conjunction
with CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instrument utilizes the principle of capillary electrophoresis in free
solution. With this technique, charged molecules are separated by their electrophoretic mobility
in an alkaline buffer with a specific pH. Separation also occurs according to the electrolyte pH
and electroosmotic flow. The hemoglobins, separated in silica capillaries, are directly detected at
an absorbance wavelength of 415 nm. The hemoglobin (Hb) fractions are separated by
absorbance spectrophotometry.

Precision study using patient samples
Within-run precision was determined at an internal site by running six newborn whole blood
native samples (FA, FAS, FAC, FAD, FAE and FA Bart's patterns) and control samples (FA
and AFSC). Each sample was analyzed using one lot of CAPI 3 NEONAT Hb kit in single
run on 12 capillaries on one CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instrument. All electropherograms were
evaluated visually. All replicates gave concordant results and the patterns corresponded to
the hemoglobin type of each tested sample.
Lot-to-lot precision study was performed by running six newborn whole blood native
samples (FA, FAS, FAC, FAD, FAE and FA Bart's patterns) and two control samples (FA
and AFSC). Each sample was analyzed once per run over two runs with three lots of CAPI 3
NEONAT Hb kit on one CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instrument for three days. One lot of CAPI 3
NEONAT Hb kit was tested on each of the three days. All electropherograms were evaluated
visually. All replicates gave concordant results and the patterns corresponded to the
hemoglobin type of each tested sample.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The interference studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP07-A3 using six
neonate whole blood samples collected on Guthrie cards. The samples consisted of FA, FAS,
FAC, FAD, FAE, FA Bart's and were analyzed at one internal site. Paired interference testing
was performed where test samples were supplemented with the potential interferent, and
results were compared to reference samples supplemented with same volume of solvent as
the interferent solution. The testing was performed using two lots of CAPI 3 NEONAT kit on
two CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instruments with samples run in one replicate. The results were
evaluated visually for hemoglobin patterns.
No interference with the CAPI 3 NEONAT Hb kit used on the CAPILLARYS 3 DBS
instrument was detected due to the newborn whole blood sample’s high concentration of the
following interfering factors listed below:

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a. Shelf-life Stability
The sponsor stated that the CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN (E) buffer in the CAPI 3
NEONAT Hb kit is unchanged as in the CAPILLARYS NEONAT Hb kit reviewed in
K091283. The established shelf-life for the CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN (E) buffer is
up to three years when stored at 2−8°C.
b. On-board stability of CAPI 3 NEONAT Hb
On-board reagent stability of the CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN(E) buffer was
conducted using one lot of CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN(E) buffer boarded on one
CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instrument as per CLSI EP25 Ed2. Six samples: two each of FA
and FAS, one of Hb AFSC control and one of Hb AF CAPI 3 NEONAT control were
used in the study. Testing was performed on day 1, 15, 31 and 38 days of CAPILLARYS
HEMOGLOBIN(E) buffer on board the CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instrument. The results
were evaluated visually for hemoglobin patterns and stability was demonstrated if the
identification pattern was identical between the reference and time points tested for all
replicates. The study supports on-board stability of one month of the CAPILLARYS
HEMOGLOBIN(E) buffer once on board the CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instrument.
c. Sample stability
The sample stability study was conducted to evaluate the stability of native neonate
whole blood samples collected and stored on Guthrie cards. The whole blood samples
were comprised of both normal and pathological hemoglobin variants (FA, FAS, FAC,
FAE, FCE, FSC, FAX and FA Bart’s) collected on Guthrie cards and stored at room
temperature (15−30°C) for 16 days, followed by storage at 2−8°C for 2 months +1 day
(from day 0 of whole blood collection). The testing was performed using one lot of CAPI
3 NEONAT Hb kit on one CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instrument. The samples were tested at
each timepoint in one replicate. The results were evaluated visually for hemoglobin
patterns and stability was demonstrated if the identification pattern was identical between
the reference and time points tested. The study supports whole blood samples dried on
Guthrie cards may be stored for 15 days at room temperature and no longer than 2
months at 2−8°C.
d. Sample transportation study

The sample transportation study was conducted to evaluate the transportation stability of
native neonate whole blood samples collected on Guthrie cards. Two separate studies
mimicking different environmental conditions were conducted. Twelve (12) neonate
whole blood samples, both normal and pathological (six samples with FA, five samples
with FAS ad one sample with FAC) collected on Guthrie cards were used for the study.
In the first study, the samples were tested at the beginning of the study (T=0) and after
storage period of 8 days at 30°C with exposure of a high hygrometry > 95 %. The results
were evaluated visually for hemoglobin patterns and stability was demonstrated if the
identification pattern was identical between the reference and time points tested. In the
second study, samples after initial analysis (T=0), were stored in a sealed opaque plastic
bag, in an envelope for 5 days where samples were cycled between 37°C for 6 hours
followed by storage at 2−8°C each day. After sample analysis on day 6, samples were
stored at 30°C for another period of 11 days. At the end of 16 days (5 days cycled at
different temperatures and 11 days at 30°C) sample analysis was performed. The results
were evaluated visually for hemoglobin patterns at T=0, 6 and 16 days, and stability was
demonstrated if the identification pattern was identical between the reference and time
points tested. The results met the acceptance criteria and samples were found to be stable
during transport.

9. Carry-Over:
The carryover study was conducted to evaluate sample retention in the capillary. Two
neonate whole blood samples, one normal (FA) and one pathological (FS) collected on
Guthrie paper were used in the study. Carry-over was assessed by the normal hemoglobin run
followed by the pathological hemoglobin run. For all normal samples analyzed after
pathological samples, the identification pattern was found unchanged. No carry-over is
observed with the CAPI 3 NEONAT Hb kit used on the CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instrument.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The study was conducted at three sites, one internal and two external sites. The results from
CAPI 3 NEONAT Hb kit performed on the CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instrument were
compared to the predicate CAPILLARYS NEONAT Hb kit on CAPILLARYS 2 instrument
using the CAPILLARYS NEONAT Fast procedure (K091283). A total of 789 newborn
K232027 - Page 11 of 13

whole blood samples collected on Guthrie cards consisting of 401 normal samples (FA) and
388 pathological samples (FAS, FAC, FAD, FA+ Bart’s, FAS+ Bart’s, FAE, FS, FSA, FAX,
FCS, AFS, FSE, FCX, FE and FAC+ Bart’s) were included in the study. One lot of CAPI 3
NEONAT Hb kit and one CAPILLARYS 3 DBS instrument were used at each site. The
overall percent agreement (OPA), positive percent agreement (PPA), the negative percent
agreement (NPA), and their 95% confidence intervals (95 % CI by Wilson score method)
were calculated for the CAPI 3 NEONAT Hb kit compared to the predicate device. The
method comparison study showed an OPA of 100% (95%CI: 96.5%, 100%), a PPA of 100%
(95%CI: 96.5%, 100%) and an NPA of 100% (95%CI: 96.6%, 100%) between the candidate
and the predicate devices.
