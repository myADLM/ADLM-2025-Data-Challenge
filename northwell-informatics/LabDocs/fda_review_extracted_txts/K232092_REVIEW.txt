B Indication(s) for Use:
The Great Basin Toxigenic C. difficile Direct Test, performed on the Great Basin PA500
Analyzer, is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the detection of toxigenic Clostridioides
difficile in unformed (liquid or soft) stool samples collected from patients suspected of having C.
difficile infection (CDI). The automated assay utilizes polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect
a conserved region of the toxin gene (tcdB) associated with toxin-producing C. difficile.
The Toxigenic C. difficile Direct Test is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of CDI in
conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

D Special Instrument Requirements:
Great Basin PA500 Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Great Basin Toxigenic C. difficile Direct Test (CDF2) performed on the PA500 Analyzer
utilizes automated, hot-start PCR amplification technology to amplify specific nucleic acid
sequences that are then detected using hybridization probes immobilized on a modified silicon
chip surface, in a single-use, self-contained test cartridge.
A swab volume of the specimen (raw stool) is first processed using the Sample Preparation
Device (SPD). During processing through the SPD, the specimen is infused with a synthetic
bacterial sample processing control (SPC). An aliquot of the eluate obtained from the SPD,
containing diluted specimen mixed with SPC, is loaded into the sample port of the CDF2 Test
Cartridge.
Genomic DNA is extracted from microbial cells and diluted to reduce potential inhibitors of
PCR. During the PCR process, biotin-labeled primers direct the amplification of specific nucleic
acid sequences within a conserved region of the C. difficile Toxin B (tcdB) gene.
Following PCR, biotin-labeled, amplified target DNA sequences are hybridized to sequence
specific probes immobilized on the silicon chip surface and incubated with anti-biotin antibody
conjugated to the horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP). The unbound conjugate is washed
away, then tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) is added to produce a colored precipitate at the location
of the probe/target sequence complex.
The resulting signal is detected by the automated PA500 Optical Reader within the PA500
Analyzer System. The SPC undergoes the same extraction, amplification, and detection steps as
the sample in order to monitor for inhibitory substances, as well as process inefficiency due to
instrument or reagent failure. No operator intervention is required once the sample is loaded into

the sample port, and the Toxigenic C. difficile Direct Test cartridge is loaded into the PA500
Analyzer.
B Principle of Operation:
The Great Basin System is a fully automated in vitro diagnostic system that includes: the PA500
Analyzer device, single-use SPDs, single-use Toxigenic C. difficile Direct Test Cartridges, and
the PA500 Data Analysis Software Program.
The PA500 Analyzer is designed to perform automated sample preparation, target amplification
via PCR, chip-based (optical) target detection, and integrated data analysis in less than two
hours.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A between-site reproducibility study was performed at three sites (two external and one
internal) by two operators per site, over five non-consecutive days using two cartridge lots
and 24 analyzers. A total of 90 negative sample replicates and 360 positive sample replicates
were tested. Two toxigenic C. difficile strains were tested: ATCC 43255 (toxinotype 0,
ribotype 087) and ATCC BAA-1805 (toxinotype IIIb, NAP1/ribotype 027).
A five-member panel, tested in triplicate, was contrived using a pool of C. difficile-negative
clinical stool matrix at the following target concentrations:
• Low positive at 1.5X LoD
• Moderate positive at 3X LoD
• True negative (TN) samples without toxigenic C. difficile
The low positive (1.5X LoD) concentrations tested were 3.9 x 104 CFU/mL and 1.1 x 105
CFU/mL for ATCC 43255 and ATCC BAA-1805, respectively. The moderate positive (3X
LoD) concentrations tested were 7.8 x 104 CFU/ml and 2.2 x 105 CFU/mL for ATCC 43255
and ATCC BAA-1805, respectively.
Results are shown by site and overall, in Table 1. For the between-site reproducibility, the
overall percent agreement was 97.8% for the low positive (1.5X) samples and 100% for
moderate positive (3X) samples for ATCC strain 43255. The overall percent agreement was
100% for the low positive (1.5X) and moderate positive (3X) samples of strain ATCC BAA-
1805. The overall percent agreement was 98.9% for the negative samples. The two false
negative results from Site 02 were attributed to assay variability and sampling error. The
false positive result from Site 02 was attributed to unintentional sample contamination by the
operator. There was no variability in results by operator or by lot.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a. Analytical inclusivity:
The analytical inclusivity of the Toxigenic C. difficile Direct Test (CDF2) assay was
evaluated by testing 22 strains of toxigenic C. difficile representing six different
toxinotypes (Summarized in Table 2). Quantitated cultures of each C. difficile strain were
diluted to 9.7 x 104 CFU/ml in clinical negative stool matrix, and three replicates per
strain were tested using six cartridge lots. All strains were detected, which is acceptable.

82 non-targeted organisms (69 bacteria, one yeast, three parasites, nine viruses) and
human DNA preparations that may be found in unformed stool specimens (see Table
3, Table 4, and Table 5). The test panel included commensal and pathogenic
microorganisms from the intestinal tract, species phylogenetically related to C.

The test panel was contrived by spiking quantitated cell cultures or nucleic acid
solutions into C. difficile-negative clinical stool matrix. Each organism was tested in
triplicate.
Under the conditions of the study, Salmonella enterica subsp. Enterica serovar
Newport gave a false positive result by the assay for one out of three replicates.
However, no false positives were observed when the culture stock was regrown, and
an additional three replicates were tested. All results were acceptable.

c. Microbial Interference
A microbial interference study was conducted to assess the potential inhibitory effect of
82 non-targeted microorganisms (See Table 6) that may be found in stool specimens.
Pools of three to five organisms were prepared in C. difficile negative clinical stool
matrix and tested in three replicates each in the presence of toxigenic C. difficile strain
ATCC 43255. The bacteria/fungi, DNA/RNA, and viruses were spiked at ≥1 x 106
CFU/mL, ≥1 x 106 copies/mL, and 1x106 TCID50/mL, respectively. The toxigenic C.
difficile was spiked at 2X LoD of this strain (5.2 x 104 CFU/mL).
No interference was observed for the detection of C. difficile strain ATCC 43255.

d. Interfering Substances
An interfering substances study was conducted to assess the potentially inhibitory effects
of 30 substances (Table 7) that may be present in stool specimens. The substances were
tested in triplicate in the presence of two strains of toxigenic C. difficile (ATCC 43255
and ATCC BAA-1805) in C. difficile negative clinical stool matrix. Substances were
spiked at higher concentrations than expected in stool specimens, and C. difficile strains
were spiked at 2X LoD (ATCC 43255 at 5.2 x 104 CFU/mL, and ATCC BAA-1805 at
1.4 x 105 CFU/mL).
No interference was observed for the 30 substances at the tested concentrations.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
e. Quality Control:
The Great Basin Toxigenic C. difficile Direct Test (CDF2) assay uses three internal
controls: a sample processing control (SPC), a hybridization control (HC), and a
detection control (DC). The SPC is included in the Sample Preparation Device supplied
with each kit. The SPC is extracted, amplified, and detected along with each specimen
tested, and it verifies the efficacy of the sample preparation, PCR amplification, and
detection processes. The HC is a control oligonucleotide attached to the silicon chip
surface. A biotinylated oligonucleotide with complementary sequence to the HC is added
to the hybridization buffer and the oligonucleotide pair provides verification that probe
hybridization is functioning properly. The DC is a biotinylated oligonucleotide probe
attached to the silicon chip surface that provides a control for the performance of the
conjugate and detection reagents for proper signal development.
The use of two external controls is recommended: a positive external control (PEC), and
negative external control (NEC). The PEC monitors for substantial reagent failure, and
the NEC monitors for environmental contamination or carryover. Each laboratory must
establish the number, type and frequency of testing external control materials per
applicable regulations or accrediting agencies. External Control materials are
recommended but not provided. External Controls are treated as if they are specimens.
Optional PEC materials include:
• ZeptoMetrix Clostridium difficile Positive Control IVD CE (Catalog No.
NATCDI-6MC-IVD).
• Remnants of a known C. difficile positive clinical stool sample or
• Culture of a known C. difficile strain (e.g., Microbiologics KWIK-STIK C.
difficile ATCC 9689, catalog no. 0329)
Optional NEC materials include:
• ZeptoMetrix Clostridium difficile Negative Control IVD CE (Catalog No.
NATCSO-6MC-IVD) or
• Remnants of a known C. difficile negative clinical stool sample.
One PEC and one NEC were processed each day of analytical and clinical testing. Of the
total 361 external controls that were run across all sites in the clinical study, 350 (97.0%)

were valid, eight (2.2%) were canceled by the end-user (test incomplete), and three
(0.8%) were invalid due to a failed internal control. All failed results repeated
successfully.
f. Sample Stability:
Specimen stability was evaluated analytically by testing pre-characterized positive and
negative clinical samples under different storage time and temperature conditions. The results
supported the stool specimen storage instructions described in the package insert.
Stool specimens can be stored at refrigerated (2°-8°C) for up to 72 hours (three days), or at
room temperature (18°-22°C) for up to 24 hours.
g. Freeze/thaw Stability:
Studies were conducted to examine the stability of stool specimens when subjected to
freeze/thaw cycles. Contrived positive stool samples contained 5X LoD and 2X LoD of C.
difficile (ATCC 43255). The study results supported a recommendation that stool samples stored
at -70ºC can undergo no more than one freeze/thaw cycles.
6. Detection Limit:
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LoD) of the Toxigenic C. difficile Direct Test
(CDF2) assay was determined using negative clinical stool specimens spiked with various
concentrations of toxigenic C. difficile bacterial suspensions. The testing to establish and confirm
the LoD included four lots, multiple instruments, and operators. Two strains of toxigenic C.
difficile (ATCC 43255, Toxinotype 0, tcdA+, tcdB+, and ATCC BAA-1805, NAP 1/027,
Toxinotype IIIb, tcdA+, tcdB+) were tested in a minimum of 20 replicates per concentration in
the confirmation study. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration at which 95% or more
of all replicates tested positive. The LoD was determined at 2.6 X 104 CFU/mL for ATCC 43255
and 7.1 X 104 CFU/ml for ATCC BAA-1805.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The performance of the Toxigenic C. difficile Direct Test (CDF2) was assessed with
remnants of unpreserved stool specimens prospectively collected from symptomatic
individuals suspected of having an C. difficile infection. Specimens were collected from three
independent clinical sites. Stool specimens were tested with a high-performing FDA-cleared
molecular C. difficile assay, which served as the basis for performance evaluation of this
assay. Specimens with discrepant results were tested with an alternative FDA-cleared
molecular C. difficile assay, performance of which is footnoted accordingly, but the original
K232092 - Page 14 of 16

performance was not changed. Prospective testing consisted of 829 stool specimens that met
the inclusion criteria.
The ages of patients ranged from less than 2 years to over 89 years with 53.3% of the
specimens coming from patients that were 19-64 years of age. Of the 829 patients tested,
52% were female, 47.4% were male, and 0.6% were undeclared gender.
Of the 829 eligible specimens, ten specimens generated false positive with the Toxigenic C.
difficile Direct Test (CDF2) and six specimens generated false negative results.
Table 8 and 9 show a summary of the clinical performance of the Toxigenic C. difficile
Direct Test (CDF2) for all sites individually and combined. The PPA and NPA values for the
Toxigenic C. difficile Direct Test (CDF2) were 95.8% and 98.5%, respectively. There was
no observable difference in performance of the Toxigenic C. difficile Direct Test (CDF2)
with respect to study site, kit lot, or patient gender or age. These results are acceptable.
