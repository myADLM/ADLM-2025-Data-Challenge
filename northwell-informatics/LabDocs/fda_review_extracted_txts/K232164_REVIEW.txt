Materials needed but not supplied with the reagent kit include Access NT-proBNP calibrators,
quality control materials (commercial control material), Lumi-Phos PRO, and UniCel DxI wash
buffer II.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access NT-proBNP is a two-site immuno-enzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. Paramagnetic
particles coated with monoclonal anti-NT-proBNP antibody and monoclonal anti-NT-proBNP
antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase are added to a reaction vessel along with a
surfactant-containing buffer and serum or plasma samples. The human NT-proBNP binds to the
anti-NT-proBNP antibody on the solid phase, while the anti-NT-proBNP antibody-alkaline
phosphatase conjugate reacts with a different antigenic site on the NT-proBNP molecule.
After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away. Then the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light
generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly
proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically
determined from a stored calibration.

The reproducibility performance was established with a multi-site precision evaluation. The
study was performed at three sites. Samples for testing were comprised of samples with 7
concentration levels for each sample matrix type with concentrations of NT-proBNP
spanning the assay measuring range. Samples were assayed in duplicate per run, two (2) runs
per day for five (5) days (n=20 per sample per site per sample type). Two calibrator lots and
three reagent lots were used at three (3) sites, with each site receiving one reagent lot. The
results are all summarized below.

2. Linearity:
The linearity performance of the Access NT-proBNP assay run on the DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer was established for serum, lithium heparin plasma and K EDTA
2
plasma respectively in a study following the recommendations of the CLSI EP06, 2nd Edition
guideline. One high sample pool above the measuring range (> 35,000 ng/L) was prepared by
pooling high concentration native patient samples for the serum sample. The EDTA and
lithium heparin plasma high pools required spiking with additional NT-proBNP antigen to
achieve the desired concentration. One low sample pool below the limit of quantification was
prepared by pooling low concentration native samples of each respective sample type. The low
and high pool samples from each sample type condition were mixed in pre-defined rations to
create an additional seven samples for each sample type. Each sample was measured on each
of three reagent pack lots and a single calibrator lot on one DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
Analyzer. The low pool from each sample type/panel was run in replicates of eight and all
other samples were run in replicates of four. The linearity was analyzed separately for each
reagent lot per sample type. Using a weighted linear regression model, the difference between
the mean observed value and the value predicted by the weighted linear regression model was
derived. At each concentration, the deviation from linearity was less than 10%. The sponsor
concluded that the assay yields a linear response over the claimed NT-proBNP measuring
range of 10 ng/L to 35,000 ng/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The analytical specificity performance of the Access pro-BNP assay was established by
conducting a cross-reactivity study and interference testing for endogenous and exogenous
substances following the CLSI EP 07, 3rd Edition guideline.
Endogenous substances
Interference from endogenous substances was assessed using lithium heparin plasma samples
with NT-proBNP at approximate concentrations of 125 ng/L and 1800 ng/L. Each of the two
samples was divided into two aliquots for a control sample (with no added interferent) and a
test sample (with added interferent). Each sample was measured on one DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer across three reagent lots and one calibrator lot. No significant
interference, defined by the sponsor as a difference within ± 10% between the mean for the
test sample versus the mean of the control samples, was observed at the following
concentrations:

Access Immunoassay Analyzer. The results support that the Access NT-proBNP reagent
pack does not show a high dose hook effect up to 400,000 ng/L (pg/mL) of NT-proBNP.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The claimed measuring range is 10.0 to 35,000 ng/L.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Metrological traceability
The Access NT-proBNP calibrator is traceable to the manufacturer’s working calibrators.
Sample Stability
The sponsor has provided information to support the following claims in their labeling:
• Separated samples are stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature, and for up to 3 days
at 2-10°C.
• Separated samples are stable at -15°C for up to 30 days.
The sponsor also provided data to support that samples stored frozen at ≤ -15°C may be
subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle.
6. Detection Limit:
The detection capability of the Access NT-proBNP assay run on the Dxl 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer was evaluated. The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD),
and limit of quantification (LoQ) were established following the recommendations in the
CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
Limit of Blank (LoB)
The LoB study was performed on four non-analyte samples using three reagent pack lots and
one calibrator lot. Each sample was analyzed across three (3) days with one run per day and
five replicates per run per reagent lot on one (1) Dxl 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer for
a total of 180 replicates. The LoB was determined non-parametrically for each reagent lot
separately and the highest value obtained from three lots was taken as the LoB value.
• The LoB for the Access NT-proBNP assay is estimated to be 1.1 ng/L
Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD study was performed using five (5) serum, six (6) EDTA, and six (6) lithium
heparin plasma native samples containing low levels of NT-proBNP analyte. In the study,
LoD was determined separately for each of three reagent pack lots using one calibrator lot on
one (1) Dxl 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. With each lot, the samples were each
assayed in replicates of five per run, two runs per day over 5 days for a total of 50
K232164 - Page 12 of 30

--- Page 13 ---
measurements per sample per reagent lot. The parametric approach described in EP17-A2
was followed to determine the LoD. The highest observed LoD of the three lots was the
reported LoD for the assay.
• The LoD for the Access NT-proBNP assay is estimated to be 4.8 ng/L (serum), 3.2
ng/L (K EDTA) and 4.3 ng/dL (LiHep)
2
Limit of Quantification (LoQ)
The LoQ study was performed using ten (10) serum, nine (9) EDTA and nine (9) Lithium
Heparin plasma samples containing low levels of NT-proBNP analyte. In the study, the LoQ
was determined separately for each of three reagent pack lots using one calibrator lot on one
(1) Dxl 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. With each lot, the samples were each assayed
in replicates of five per run, two runs per day over 5 days for a total of 50 measurement per
sample per reagent lot. The LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration of analyte
which can be measured with a within-laboratory precision of 20% CV, and the highest value
obtained from three lots was the reported LoQ for the assay.
• The LoQ for the Access NT-proBNP assay is estimated to be 4.8 ng/L (serum), 3.2
ng/L (K EDTA), and 4.3 ng/L (LiHep).
2
These studies support the following detection capability claims in the labeling:
Limit of Blank (LoB): 1.1 ng/L
Limit of Detection (LoD): 4.8 ng/L
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) (≤ 20% within-lab CV): 4.8 ng/L
7. Assay Cut-Off:
See section D. for Clinical Cut-off information.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not Applicable: see clinical studies in Section C.
2. Matrix Comparison:
The assay is intended for use with serum and plasma (K -EDTA and lithium heparin). In
2
addition to precision, linearity and clinical studies, a matrix equivalency study was conducted
to support the use of serum and K EDTA samples with the Access NT-proBNP on the DxI
2
9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. In the study, 68 donor matched samples of the
aforementioned were collected. For each combination, each sample was tested in three
replicates using one DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. The results were analyzed
using Passing-Bablok regression analysis comparing the first replicate of the test tube to the
mean of the control tube. The results support the use of K -EDTA plasma, lithium heparin
2
plasma and serum on the Access NT-proBNP assay.

Clinical Performance Studies in the Emergency Department
A multi-center prospective study including 17 clinical collection sites and 3 clinical
laboratory testing sites across in the United States was conducted to establish the clinical
performance characteristics of the Access NT-proBNP assay run on the DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer. In this study, subjects 22 years and older presenting with signs and
symptoms that raise clinical suspicion of acute heart failure were enrolled in the study.
Subjects with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic dialysis and subjects with
dyspnea clearly not secondary to HF (e.g., primary lung disease or chest trauma) were
excluded from the study. For each patient enrollment, a serum, a K -EDTA, and a lithium
2
heparin sample were collected for determination of their NT-proBNP concentration. The
Access NT pro-BNP assay results were determined on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
Analyzer using stored frozen samples collected from 2384 ED subjects consisting of 48.2%
(1149/2384) female subjects and 51.8% (1235/2384) male subjects. Individuals in the
population were 35.7% Black or African American, 57.8% White or Caucasian, and 6.5%
Asian. The sponsor provided information to support the use of the frozen samples in their
study.
The descriptive statistics for the Access NT-proBNP results were determined within and
across sex and age groups. The results are summarized below.

A diagnosis of acute HF or no acute HF was determined for each subject by an independent
central adjudication panel consisting of medical doctors with a specialty in cardiology or
heart failure. For the 2384 subjects enrolled in the study, a total of 1059 subjects were
adjudicated as subjects with acute HF and 1325 subjects were adjudicated as subjects without
acute HF.

The pretest probabilities of HF (prevalence of HF in the clinical study), posttest probabilities,
likelihood ratios, and the two-tailed 95% CI of the test results versus adjudicated diagnosis
were determined using the age-dependent positive cut-offs (450 ng/L for subjects 22 - < 50
years old; 900 ng/L for subjects 50 - ≤ 75 years old; 1800 ng/L for subjects >75 years old)
and age-independent negative (300 ng/mL) cutoff and are summarized in the following
tables:

Correlation of the Access NT-proBNP assay results with New York Heart Association
(NYHA) functional classification in patients diagnosed with HF:
The Assess NT-proBNP results were determined from samples from 1043 subjects with heart
failure. The population consisted of 450 females and 593 males. The descriptive statistics for
the Access NT-proBNP results (ng/L) were determined across sex and are summarized in the
following table:

In the labeling, the sponsor states the following:
The JT test of trending was conducted on the 1043 subjects with an enrollment site NYHA
evaluation and an adjudicated acute HF diagnosis resulting in a Z statistic of 4.1991 and p-value
< 0.001. These results indicate that there is a statistically significant relationship between Access
NT-proBNP results and HF severity as determined by NYHA class.

Risk stratification of patient with heart failure (HF) and risk stratification of acute coronary
syndrome (ACS).
The sponsor provided information to support the risk stratification of heart failure and acute
coronary syndrome claims based on the following three peer-reviewed literature references:
Reference 1: N-Terminal Pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide and Other Risk Markers for the
Separate Prediction of Mortality and Subsequent Myocardial Infarction in Patients with
Unstable Coronary Artery Disease, GUSTO IV Substudy, James, S.K. et al, Circulation
2003, 108(3): 275-281.
Reference 2: N-Terminal Pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide on Admission for Early Risk
Stratification of Patients with Chest Pain and No ST-Segment Elevation, Jernberg, T. et al.
Journal of the American College of Cardiology , 2002, 40(3): 437-445.
Reference 3: N-Terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide, but not the new putative cardiac
hormone relaxin, predicts prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure. Fisher, C. et al.

D Clinical Cut-Off:
For patients in the Emergency Department (ED) settings, the Access NT-proBNP assay
results should be interpreted as indicated in the table below.
Age Group
NT-proBNP Results (ng/L) Interpretation
(Years)
All < 300 ng/L Heart Failure Unlikely
<50 ≥ 300 - < 450 Grey Zone: Results Indeterminate-
50-75 ≥300 - <900 consider other reasons for NT-
>75 ≥300 - <1800 proBNP elevation
<50 ≥450
50-75 ≥900 Heart Failure Likely
>75 ≥1800
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The expected values of NT-proBNP in healthy adults was established in a study conducted in
accordance with CLSI EP28-A3.
In the study, lithium heparin, serum and K EDTA levels of NT-proBNP were assayed with the
2
Access NT-proBNP assay on a total of 675 apparently healthy subjects (369 females and 306
males ) without HF. The results were subgrouped by sex, with each group of females and males
were stratified into three age groups of : < 50 years, 50-75 years, and >75 years. The exclusion
criteria used were:
• Disease(s) of /or affecting the cardiovascular system.
• Poorly controlled hypertension (defined as current blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg systolic,
or ≥85 mm Hg diastolic).

• Current taking mediation for cardiovascular disease (except medications to control
hypertension).
• Body-mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2
• Diabetes
• Chronic kidney disease
• Other serious chronic disease(s) (e.g., cancer, COPD, HIV, lupus erythematosus, etc).
• Acute bacterial or viral infection.
Representative data from lithium heparin samples is summarized in the following tables:
