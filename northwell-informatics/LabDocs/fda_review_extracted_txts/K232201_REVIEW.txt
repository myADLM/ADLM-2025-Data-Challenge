time of comparative testing: Benzylpenicillin (p01n): Streptococcus pneumoniae (When
applying breakpoints of ≤2 (S), 4 (I), ≥8 (R)), Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcus
C Special Instrument Requirements:
For use with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems. VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact
Systems (VITEK 2 Systems version 5.02 was used in K11200. New breakpoints will be
incorporated into a future VITEK 2 Systems software release.)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well which contains only nutrient medium is resident on
all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the
nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45% to
0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The
VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial
suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The data are used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
The VITEK 2 AST-Streptococcus Penicillin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.06,
0.12, 0.5, and 2 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The
MIC result range for the VITEK 2 AST-Streptococcus Penicillin test is ≤0.06 - ≥8 µg/mL. For
all species, the MIC result range indicates that the VITEK 2 system is capable of producing the
following MIC results ≤0.06, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and ≥8 for AST-Streptococcus Penicillin
test. This means the VITEK 2 systems does not provide results lower than 0.06µg/mL or greater
than 8 µg/mL for the AST-Streptococcus Penicillin test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-Streptococcus Penicillin was previously
evaluated during review of K112000 and was determined to be acceptable.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Not applicable
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Quality Control (QC) testing, Inoculum and Growth failure for the VITEK 2 AST-
Streptococcus Penicillin were performed in support of clearance of K112000 and were
determined acceptable. QC testing specific to the additional oral penicillin breakpoints was
not performed in the current submission since the penicillin QC range of 0.25 – 1 μg/mL
used in K112000 was unchanged for S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619. The QC results with the
unchanged QC range are shown in Table 1.
In summary, the QC organism recommended by both the FDA and CLSI, namely S.
pneumoniae ATCC 49619 was tested using the reference broth microdilution (BMD) method
as well as the VITEK 2 AST-Streptococcus Penicillin by the automatic and the manual
dilution methods during the clinical study a minimum 20 times/site. QC results for the
VITEK 2 AST-Streptococcus Penicillin were within the expected results range >95% of the
time for both automatic and manual dilution modes of the VITEK 2 (Table 1), which is
acceptable. In addition, a similar QC study conducted to evaluate the VITEK 2 Compact
System demonstrated QC results within the expected results range >95% of the time, which
is acceptable.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The VITEK 2 AST-ST Penicillin was originally cleared in premarket submission K112000
and included indications for Beta-hemolytic streptococci groups C and G, Streptococcus
pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus viridans group, and Streptococcus
pneumoniae for testing with the VITEK 2 auto dilution, the VITEK 2 manual dilution, and
the VITEK 2 Compact manual dilution. VITEK 2 AST-ST Penicillin results were compared
to the CLSI broth microdilution reference method.
The performance of the VITEK 2 AST-Streptococcus Penicillin with S. pneumoniae using
the current FDA-recognized oral penicillin breakpoints was evaluated by reanalyzing the data
obtained for S. pneumoniae in support of K112000. S. pneumoniae performance when using
both the oral penicillin breakpoints as well as the unchanged parenteral (injection) penicillin
(meningitis and non-meningitis) breakpoints are summarized in this submission. Breakpoints
for β-hemolytic Streptococci and Viridians species also remain unchanged; performance data
are not shown here.
Since there was no change in the design or the penicillin dilution range of the VITEK 2 AST
card, the performance evaluation of the VITEK 2 AST-Streptococcus Penicillin with S.
pneumoniae for the oral penicillin breakpoints was achieved by reanalyzing the penicillin
MIC data of the original 510(k) submission (K112000). For this review, the current penicillin
(oral and parenteral) breakpoints are applied to S. pneumoniae according to the FDA STIC
webpage.
A total of 350 (clinical and challenge) S. pneumoniae isolates were tested using the VITEK 2
with the auto dilution. S. pneumoniae results of the original data using the unchanged
parenteral breakpoints and re-analyzed data using the oral breakpoints are summarized in
Table 2.
The Essential Agreement (EA) and Categorical Agreement (CA) when using each of the
parenteral breakpoints is >90%, which is acceptable, as described in the “Class II Special
Control Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance

for Industry and FDA, August 2009” (AST guidance). When using the oral breakpoints, the
EA is >90% and the CA is 89.1%, which is acceptable since the majority of errors is minor
and the EA of evaluable results is very good, as described in the AST guidance. There were
no major or very major errors observed with the oral and parenteral non-meningitis
breakpoints.
When analyzing the performance data with the parenteral non-meningitis penicillin
breakpoints, the Essential Agreement (EA) and Categorical Agreement (CA) is >90%,
which is acceptable, as described in the “Class II Special Control Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA, August
2009” (AST guidance). There were no major or very major errors observed.
When analyzing the performance data with the parental meningitis penicillin breakpoints,
the EA and CA is >90%, which is acceptable, as described in the AST guidance. As
previously reported in K112000, there were 6 major errors (3.2% major error rate) and 2 very
major errors (1.2% very major error rate). The major error rate was considered
acceptable given the very high overall CA agreement and lack of an intermediate meningitis
interpretive criterion for penicillin. During this review, further analysis of the categorical
errors was performed and adjustments made by considering the MIC values where the errors
occurred. Five of the six major errors and one of the two very major errors was one doubling
dilution from the reference and thus in essential agreement. Therefore, the adjusted major
error rate is 0.5% (1/189) and the adjusted very major error rate is 0.6% (1/161), which is
acceptable. To address the adjustment of the major error, the following performance footnote
was included in the device labeling:
“The overall major error rate for penicillin when testing S. pneumoniae and using the
meningitis breakpoints is 3.2% (6/189). Based on the essential agreement and lack of an
intermediate meningitis breakpoint for penicillin, the overall adjusted major error rate
for S. pneumoniae clinical and challenge isolates is 0.5% (1/189).”
When analyzing the performance data with the oral non-meningitis penicillin breakpoints,
the EA is >90% and the CA is 89.1%, which is acceptable since the majority of errors are
minor and the EA of evaluable results is very good, as described in the AST guidance. There
were no major or very major errors observed.

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the MIC result of the reference method and that of the
VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on
scale for both the VITEK 2 test card and the reference method or those in which an off scale result is at least two doubling
dilutions from the on scale result. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference
method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK 2 test card.
Performance of the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact was also evaluated with the
same 50 challenge organisms using the manual dilution method. Comparisons to the
reference method are shown below in Table 3.

(S), 4 (I), ≥8 (R)), Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcus
MIC Trending Analysis
A trending reanalysis was performed using the combined (clinical and challenge) data
obtained in K112000 to align with current trending analyses. This trending calculation takes
into account MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or
higher than the reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values are on-scale
or not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in

exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the trending analysis.
Organisms in which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs. lower
MIC values was ≥ 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined to be
statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that showed
higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in the labeling. No
trending was observed.

The labeling was updated to include:
• Addition of oral penicillin non-meningitis breakpoints for testing S. pneumoniae.
• Performance data using the unchanged FDA-recognized parenteral penicillin breakpoints
for S. pneumoniae (meningitis and non-meningitis) and additional performance data
using the FDA-recognized oral penicillin breakpoints
• Inclusion of a footnote to the performance table to describe the adjusted major error rate
when using parental meningitis penicillin breakpoints.
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device when evaluated with
the current FDA-recognized penicillin breakpoints for tests with Streptococcus pneumoniae.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized
susceptibility test interpretive criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint
change protocol that was reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future
revisions to device labeling in response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA
STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 System with penicillin when revised breakpoints for
penicillin are published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included
with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the
penicillin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section
after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any
new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
