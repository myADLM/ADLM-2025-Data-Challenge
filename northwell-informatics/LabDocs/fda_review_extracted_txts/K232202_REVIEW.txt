1.0.0.5033)
• Display
The Aperio GT 450 DX scanner is a semi-automated benchtop brightfield WSI scanner which
includes the scanner configuration software and Aperio GT 450 Scanner Administration Manager DX (SAM
DX) and is intended to scan surgical pathology glass slides prepared from FFPE tissue. The scanner
supports continuous glass-slide loading of up to 15 racks with a total of 450-slide capacity, priority
rack scanning, and automated image quality checks during image acquisition. The Aperio GT 450
DX scanner detects the racks once loaded in the scanner and automatically loads each slide in the
batch to the stage and scans the glass slide to generate the WSI image. It can achieve a scan speed
of 32 seconds at the 40x scanning magnification for a 15 mm x 15 mm area. Users operate the
scanner via a touchscreen interface.
The Aperio GT 450 DX scanner can save digital images in a unique Aperio ScanScope Virtual
Slide (SVS) image format or Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) image
format. SVS images displayed in Aperio WebViewer DX are compressed to 94% of the source
SVS file, or JPEG Q = 94. After acquiring the scanned digital images, they are sent to end-user-
provided image storage attached to the scanner’s local network, where they can be cataloged in
image storage software including Image Management System (IMS), such as Aperio eSlide
Manager or a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).
Aperio GT 450 SAM DX is centralized scanner management software external to the connected
scanner(s). This software application enables configuration, monitoring, and service access of
multiple scanners from a single desktop client location. Aperio GT 450 SAM DX is installed on a
customer-provided server that resides on the same network as the scanner(s) for image
management.
The Aperio WebViewer DX image viewing software is a web-based image viewer that enables
users to perform quality control of images and to review and annotate digital images acquired from
the Aperio GT450 DX scanner for pathology primary diagnosis. The Aperio WebViewer DX also
incorporates monitor display image validation checks, which provide the user with the ability to
ensure the digital slide images are displayed as intended on their monitor, and that browser updates
have not inadvertently affected the image display quality. Aperio WebViewer DX is installed on
a server and accessed from an IMS (e.g., Aperio eSlide Manager) or a customer’s Laboratory
Information System (LIS) using compatible browsers.
The display allows the slide images to be viewed. The interoperable displays are thin-film
transistor, in-plane switching (TFT), color liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCD/IPS) calibrated to
the sRGB color space. Their specifications are listed in Table 8 below.
Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Aperio GT 450 DX
K232202 - Page 3 of 20

--- Page 4 ---
2. Specimen Identification:
Glass slides and scanned images are identified based on the previously assigned specimen
identifiers such as patient identifiers, barcodes, etc. Digital images of surgical pathology
slides prepared from FFPE tissue.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling and handling are performed upstream and independent of the use of the
subject device. Specimen sampling includes surgical pathology specimens such as biopsy or
resection specimens which are processed using standard histology techniques. The FFPE
tissue sections are stained using the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining procedure. Then
digital images are obtained from these glass slides using the Aperio GT 450 DX scanner.
4. Calibration:
The Aperio GT 450 DX scanner performs essential image calibrations at the time the scanner
is powered on. No additional calibration is needed for regular use. There is no calibration for
Aperio GT 450 DX software.
5. Quality Control:
Quality control (QC) activities are performed by the user per the laboratory standards and
professional guidelines (e.g., staining, cover-slipping, barcode placement) prior to loading
the slides into the Aperio GT 450 DX scanner. After completing a scan, the lab technician
checks image data and image quality as per the instructions for use. Before review, the
pathologist performs quality control on the WSI images of the slide per instructions for use.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The objective of this study was to evaluate the repeatability (within- and between- system) and
reproducibility (between-site) of the Aperio GT 450 DX.
The precision of the device was based on 5 reading pathologists’ assessments and identification
of specific histopathologic “features” that are observed in FFPE H&E stained slides. Twenty-
three (23) primary features were selected for the analytical studies. The selected primary features
were evaluated at their relevant magnifications -12 primary features evaluated at 20x
magnification level and 11 primary features evaluated at 40x magnification level.
The Precision Panel Slide Curator (curator) identified study slides by conducting a Lab
Information System (LIS) search and reviewing the microscope slides from consecutive cases
that potentially contain the study features (Table 1). A representative H&E stained slide or a re-
cut slide containing the feature(s) of interest was obtained from each case. After the curator
selected and marked the study features on the slides, the slides were scanned at magnification
levels designated to the study features, either 20x or 40x magnification. The curator reviewed the
glass slides through the microscope while reviewing the WSI images on the monitor to extract
Field of Views (FOVs) containing the study features from the WSI images using a lossless
compression type. For each subsequent WSI images of the same slide, the annotations were
manually replicated by a technician using the image viewing software to extract and randomly
rotate the FOVs by 90, 180 or 270 degrees to minimize recall bias. A trained study personnel
verified the FOV filenames and also that the FOV extraction areas were correct and enrolled the
FOVs in the study. During precision study, the extracted FOV images were restricted for both
the area of tissue visible to the reading pathologists and for the viewing magnification. The
reading pathologists were not allowed to navigate the WSI image or change magnification or get
access to any clinical information associated with the study slides. Additional slides that may or
may not include any of the study features were included as “wild card” slides to reduce recall
K232202 - Page 7 of 20

--- Page 8 ---
bias. The “wild card” FOVs were extracted by following the same procedures as the study FOVs.
As shown in Table 1, each primary study feature was represented in 3 FFPE sections of different
organ types. From each slide, 2 or 3 FOVs containing either one primary study feature, or a
primary study feature and secondary study feature(s) in each FOV were selected. A total of 202
FOVs were selected from 69 glass slides. Out of 202 FOVs, 46 FOVs (from 24 slides) contained
multiple histologic features and 156 FOVs (from 62 slides) contained one primary histologic
feature. In addition, 36 wild card FOVs were selected from 12 glass slides. There was a
minimum washout period of 14 days between pathologist reading sessions.

The precision of the Aperio GT 450 DX was assessed in 3 sub-studies:
• Within-system precision was assessed using 3 independent systems. Overall within-
system precision was also assessed.
• Between-system/site precision, was assessed 3 independent systems at 3 different sites.
Overall between systems/sites precision was also assessed.
• Within- and between-pathologist precision was assessed using images generated from a
single system. Overall within-pathologists and overall between-pathologists precision were
also assessed.
The precision was considered acceptable if the lower bounds of the 2-sided 95% confidence
interval (CI) of the overall agreements for each precision component (within-system,
between-system/site, within-pathologist, and between-pathologist) were ≥ 85%
Within-System Precision
This study evaluated the agreement between the 3 scans from the same system/site. The panel
of 69 study slides was split equally among the three (3) sites (i.e., each site scanned a separate
subset of slides). Each site has a single scanning system. For each system, 23 slides were
scanned once on each of three (3) days, producing three (3) sets of scans for each slide. FOVs
were extracted from scanned WSI images. The FOVs from three scanning sessions were
evaluated by one reading pathologist over three different reading sessions with at least a two-
week washout period in between the reading sessions. In each reading session, the reading
pathologist evaluated all 202 study FOVs from each of three scanning sessions (across three
scanning systems), plus unique “wild card” FOVs to assist in preventing recall bias between
reading sessions.
For each system, agreements between scan 1 versus scan 2, scan 1 versus scan 3 and scan 2
versus scan 3 were analyzed. The overall within-system precision was based on the pooled
data of all three systems. A bootstrap approach was used to calculate 95% Confidence
Intervals (CIs).

Between-System/Between-Site Precision
At each of three study sites, a study technician scanned the entire set of 69 study slides once.
FOVs from three scanning sessions (resulting from one session from each of the three sites) were
extracted. From all the scanning systems, 606 FOVs were transferred to a single reading
pathologist for evaluation in three separate reading sessions. In each reading session, the reading
pathologist evaluated all 202 study FOVs from a single site, plus unique “wild card” FOVs to
assist in preventing recall bias between reading sessions. Agreements between systems at Site 1
versus Site 2, systems at Site 1 versus Site 3 and systems at Site 2 versus Site 3 were analyzed.
The overall inter-system/inter-site precision is based on the pooled data from each system-to-
system comparison. A bootstrap approach was used to calculate 95% CIs.

The entire set of 69 slides were scanned once at one site. FOVs were extracted and saved in three
different orientations. From all the orientations, 606 FOVs were presented to each of three reading
pathologists for evaluation in three reading sessions. In each reading session, each reading
pathologist evaluated all 202 study FOVs plus unique “wild card” FOVs to assist in preventing recall
bias between reading sessions. For within-pathologist precision, agreements between FOVs in
orientation 1 versus orientation 2, orientation 1versus orientation 3, and orientation 2 versus
orientation 3 were analyzed for each reading pathologist. The overall within-pathologist precision
was based on the pooled data from each reading pathologist. A bootstrap approach was used to
calculate 95% CIs.

K232202 - Page 14 of 20

--- Page 15 ---
digital images of surgical pathology FFPE tissue slides using the Aperio GT 450 DX System
is non-inferior to using optical (light) microscopy. The primary endpoint was the difference in
major discordance rates between WSI review modality (WSIR) and microscope slide review
modality (MSR) when compared to the reference (main) diagnosis, which is based on the
original sign-out pathologic diagnosis rendered at the institutions, using an optical (light)
microscope. The study cases were selected from the previous Aperio AT2 DX System clinical
study (K190332). In order to ensure cases met the selection criteria and that selected slides
were representative of the primary diagnosis the case curation process and the study inclusion
and exclusion criteria in the previous study were as follows: The case curation pathologist
reviewed the sign-out diagnosis and supporting documentation available at the time of the
diagnosis (i.e., pathology report). By reviewing the microscopic slides used to make the sign-
out diagnosis, the slide(s) that were representative of the sign-out diagnosis for the case were
identified. The selected slides included H&E, immunohistochemistry (IHC), special stains and
any slides that were not critical to diagnosis but supported the final surgical pathology report
(e.g., margins, lymph node status, vascular and neural invasion), and any slides representing
required elements of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) applicable cancer protocols.
In the case of IHCs and special stains, the inclusion of control slides was required to fulfill the
quality checks according to general clinical practice. The site’s curation verification
pathologist verified that the selected slide(s) reflected the main diagnosis for the case as well
as the required ancillary information for cancer cases met all inclusion criteria and none of the
exclusion criteria stated below before the case was enrolled in the study.
Inclusion criteria:
• All glass slides with human tissue obtained via surgical pathology of the original case
were available.
• The original sign-out diagnosis and ancillary supporting information were available.
• The selected slide(s) for the main diagnosis and the control slide(s) (e.g., controls for
IHC stained slides) matched the study requested organ type and fulfilled the quality
checks according to general clinical practice.
• For cases with multiple diagnoses in a single sign-out pathology report, only the main
diagnosis and ancillary information were included.
Exclusion criteria:
• H&E stained slides that were used for the original sign-out diagnosis were not
available at the site and re-cuts were not available.
• If applicable, the IHC or special stain slides that were used for the original sign out
diagnosis were not available at the site or had unacceptable artifacts. Control slides for
IHC or special stain were not available.
• Cases for which slides needed to support the original sign-out diagnosis required either a
special light source (e.g., a mercury lamp for fluorescence microscopy) or special filters
(e.g., for polarized light).
• Cases with slides containing unremovable markings or were damaged.
• Cases that contained frozen sections or gross specimens only.
• Cases that were missing significant clinical and ancillary information that was available
at the time the case was originally interpreted (e.g., X-rays).
• Cases that were signed out less than one year prior to the date of curation.
• Only one case could be enrolled per patient.
A total of 1161 cases were selected to be enrolled in the current study and included a diverse
K232202 - Page 15 of 20

--- Page 16 ---
mixture of pathologic diagnoses and tissue/organ types. There was a total of 3 study sites.
At each site of the 3 study sites, technician(s) scanned slides from cases identified at their sites
using the Aperio GT 450 DX. Each reading pathologist at each site (3 pathologists at each of
sites 1 and 2 and 4 pathologists at Site 3) evaluated all study cases from their site using the
Aperio GT 450 DX, as well as the case ancillary information to determine WSIR diagnosis. For
each reading pathologist, approximately 50% of cases were reviewed from the site’s local server
(local access) and approximately 50% of cases were reviewed from the LBS image web hosting
site (remote access). If the WSIR diagnosis could not be determined, the reading pathologist
could defer the diagnosis. The reason(s) for deferring a diagnosis was documented.
There was a total of 3709 case reads performed by WSIR: (Site 1: 399 cases × 3 pathologists) +
(Site 2: 500 cases × 3 pathologists) + (Site 3: 253 × 4 pathologists). There were 1883 case reads
(1883/3709, 50.8%) performed at the local viewing station (local cohort) and 1826 number of
cases reads (1826/3709, 49.2%) performed at the remote viewing station (remote cohort). For
MSR diagnosis, the consensus scores generated during the previous Aperio AT2 DX System
clinical study (K190332) were used for this study to estimate MSR diagnosis major discordance
rate.
A minimum of 2 adjudication pathologists (also known as adjudicators) independently assessed
concordance (concordant, minor discordance, major discordance) of the WSIR diagnosis against
the sign-out diagnosis (reference diagnosis) using predefined rules. A major discordance was
defined as a difference in diagnosis that resulted in a clinically important difference in patient
management, while a minor discordance would not be associated with a clinically important
difference in patient management. The concordance score for the same case between the 2
adjudicators were compared to determine a consensus score for major discordance status. If
consensus was not reached between the first 2 adjudicators, a third adjudicator reviewed the
study diagnosis against the reference diagnosis. If consensus between 2 of 3 adjudicators was
still not reached, then the 3 adjudicators convened as a panel to come to a consensus for the
major discordant status. WSIR diagnosis consensus scores were used to estimate WSIR
diagnosis major discordant rate.
Major discordance rates were estimated for WSIR diagnosis and MSR diagnosis (relative to the
reference diagnosis), as well as the difference in overall major discordance rates between the 2
modalities. For the primary objective of demonstrating the WSIR major discordance rate to be
non-inferior to the MSR major discordance rate, a Generalized Linear Mixed Model
(GLIMMIX) logistic regression was conducted. For each reading result the dependent variable
was the major discordance status and independent variables included modality as a fixed effect
(WSIR vs. MSR) and site, reader, and case as random effects. A two-sided 95% CI for the
modality effect, i.e., the overall major discordance rate difference (WSIR minus MSR), was
constructed from this analysis. If the upper bound of the 95% CI was less than the non-inferiority
margin of 4%, WSIR would be considered non-inferior to MSR shows the overall major
discordance rates of the full cohort for both modalities (relative to the reference diagnosis) based
on observed results and by the generalized linear model.
Thirty-six (36) WSIR case reads from 1 pathologist at Site 2 were excluded due to incorrectly
assigned diagnoses (14 case reads from the local cohort and 22 case reads from the remote
cohort). One case read (remote cohort) from 1 pathologist at Site 2 was excluded from both
modalities due to an absence of MSR data from previous Aperio AT2 DX System Accuracy
Study. Therefore, 3672 and 3708 cases read were performed by WSIR (local cohort: 1869 case
reads; remote cohort: 1803 case reads) and MSR, respectively.
K232202 - Page 16 of 20

--- Page 17 ---
Excluding the 122 (3.3%, 122/3672) WSIR and 77 (2.1%, 77/3708) MSR deferred diagnoses
(cases for which no study diagnoses was assigned and were not sent for adjudication), 3550
WSIR and 3631 MSR diagnoses were generated by the reading pathologists and sent for
adjudication. Of the 122 WSIR deferred diagnoses, 62 (62/122, 50.1%) were from the local
cohort and 60 (60/122, 49.2%) were from the remote cohort, resulting in 1807 and 1743
diagnoses for the local and remote cohorts, respectively. Note: MSR diagnoses were generated
during the previous Aperio AT2 DX System clinical study (K190332).
One WSIR diagnosis (local cohort) was deferred by the adjudicators. Therefore, 3549 WSIR
diagnoses were included in the statistical analyses (1806 from the local cohort and 1743 from the
remote cohort). For MSR, 3631 diagnoses had consensus scores (from the previous Aperio AT2
DX System clinical study) and were included in the statistical analyses. analyses.
Study Results
The overall observed major discordance rate for WSIR diagnosis was 6.14% (218/3549) and for
MSR diagnosis was 3.66% (133/3631). The overall major discordance rates estimated by the
generalized linear model were 5.84% (95% CI: 5.01% to 6.80%) for the WSIR diagnosis and
3.44% (95% CI: 2.84 to 4.17%) for the MSR diagnosis. The estimated difference in major
discordance rates (WSIR diagnosis minus MSR diagnosis) was 2.40% (95% CI: 1.40% to
3.39%). The upper bound of the 95% CI of the estimated difference in major discordance rates
was 3.39% which met the predefined acceptance criteria of ≤4%.
The secondary endpoint was to demonstrate that the overall major discordant rate between the
WSIR diagnosis and the reference diagnosis did not exceed 7%; the upper bound of the 95% CI
for the overall major discordant rate of WSIR diagnosis was 6.80%, which met the predefined
acceptance criteria of ≤7%. Thus, the study met the primary objective. Study results are shown in
the table below.

The observed estimates for the major discordance rates for the WSIR and MSR diagnoses
(relative to the reference diagnosis) and the difference between the two modalities (WSIR major
discordance rate minus MSR major discordance rate) for each organ for the full cohort, local
cohort and remote cohort are as follows: Three (3) organ types (appendix, gallbladder, and
hernial/peritoneal) had observed major discordance rates of 0.00% for both modalities in the full
cohort. For the local cohort, there were an additional 2 organ types [kidney (neoplastic) and
salivary gland] that had major discordance rates of 0.00% for both modalities. Excluding these
organs from the respective cohorts, the difference in major discordance rates (WSIR diagnosis
minus MSR diagnosis) ranged from -3.13% (brain/neuro) to 7.70% (skin) for the full cohort, -
6.52% (brain/neuro) to 8.88% (skin) for the local cohort and -3.49% (GE junction) to 9.38%
(liver/BD) for the remote cohort. The clinical study was not powered to analyze results by
individual organ site or diagnosis. The performance of Aperio GT 450 DX was determined by
the overall difference in major discordance rate between WSIR and MSR.

E. Human Factor Study:
Human factors studies for Aperio GT 450 DX were conducted. The studies were designed
around critical user tasks and use scenarios performed by representative users from
histotechnicians and pathologists. The information included a list of all critical user tasks and
a description of the process used to identify them. A systematic evaluation involving
simulated use by representative users performing all tasks (including critical tasks) required
for the operation of the device and a subjective assessment of failure was provided. All
participants were able to perform all tasks (including the critical tasks) and no critical task
failures were observed. There were several occasional difficulties, which was attributed to
