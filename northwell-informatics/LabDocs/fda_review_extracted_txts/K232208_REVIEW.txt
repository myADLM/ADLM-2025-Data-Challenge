B Indication(s) for Use:
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use
Sectra Digital Pathology Module (3.3) is a software device intended for viewing and
management of digital images of scanned surgical pathology slides prepared from formalin-fixed
paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. It is an aid to the pathologist to review and interpret these
digital images for the purposes of primary diagnosis.
Sectra Digital Pathology Module (3.3) is not intended for use with frozen section, cytology, or
non-FFPE hematopathology specimens. It is the responsibility of the pathologist to employ
appropriate procedures and safeguards to assure the validity of the interpretation of images using
Sectra Digital Pathology Module (3.3).
Sectra Digital Pathology Module (3.3) is intended for use with Leica’s Aperio GT 450 DX
scanner and Dell U3223QE display, for viewing and management of the ScanScope Virtual Slide
(SVS) and Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) image formats.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Sectra Digital Pathology Module (3.3) [henceforth referred to DPAT (3.3)] is a digital slide
viewing system for viewing and managing digital pathology images of glass slides obtained from
the Aperio GT 450 DX scanner and viewed on the Dell U3223QE display. The DPAT (3.3) can
only be used in combination with the external image server provided by Sectra picture archiving
and communications system (PACS). The end user must log in to Sectra Workstation to access
the subject device. Sectra Workstation is available in two models: IDS7 and UniView. UniView
is an equivalent, web-based version of IDS7. The architecture of DPAT (3.3) consists of the
following elements:
• Pathology Image Window (PIW) where the scanned slides are viewed and manipulated
by end users. The PIW is a web application embedded into Sectra Workstation to offer a
seamless user experience.
• Sectra Pathology Server (SPS) is the main server component of the web-based Pathology
Image Window. The SPS supports displaying and manipulating the scanned slides.
• Database Engine stores metadata such as annotations required by the SPS.
• Sectra Pathology Import Server (SPIS) is used for importing digital pathology images
(from scanned slides) from the Aperio GT 450 DX scanner as an alternative to the
scanner sending images to Sectra PACS using the standard DICOM Storage.
K232208 - Page 2 of 14

--- Page 3 ---
The system capabilities include:
• retrieving and displaying digital slides
• including support for remote intranet access over computer networks
• providing tools for annotating digital slides and entering and editing metadata associated with
digital slides
• displaying the scanned slide images for primary diagnosis by pathologists
The DPAT (3.3) is operated as follows:
1. The DPAT (3.3) receives quality-controlled images from the Aperio GT 450 DX scanner and
extracts a copy of the images’ metadata. The unaltered images are then sent to the external
image storage (Sectra Core). A copy of the image metadata (e.g., the pixel size) is stored
locally in the subject device to increase the operational performance (e.g., response times) of
the subject device.
2. The reading pathologist selects a case (patient) from a worklist external to the subject
device such as the laboratory information system (LIS) whereby the SPS fetches the
associated images from the Sectra Core.
3. The reading pathologist uses DPAT (3.3) to view the images and is able to perform the
following actions, as needed:
• Zoom and pan the image
• Measure distances and areas in the image
• Annotate images
• View multiple images side by side in a synchronized fashion
After viewing all images belonging to a particular case (patient), the pathologist will make a
diagnosis. The diagnosis is documented in another system such as the LIS.
DPAT (3.3) operates with the following components listed below in Table 1.

B Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Sectra Digital Pathology Module (3.3)
2. Specimen Identification:
The Sectra Digital Pathology Module (3.3) uses digital pathology images obtained from the
Aperio GT 450 DX scanner of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained glass slides. The
reading pathologist selects a case (patient) from a worklist external to the subject device
whereby the subject device fetches the associated images from the external image storage.
The scanned images are identified based on the previously assigned specimen identifier such
as the laboratory specimen accession number.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling and handling are performed upstream and independent of the use of the
subject device. Specimen sampling includes biopsy or resection specimens which are
processed using histology techniques. The FFPE tissue section is hematoxylin & eosin
(H&E) stained. Digital images are then obtained from these glass slides using the Aperio GT
450 DX scanner.
4. Calibration:
Not Applicable
5. Quality Control:
The subject device receives quality-controlled images from the scanner. The subject device
specific quality control measures are as follows:
• Connect scanner - This test should be performed before connecting the scanner to
the subject device in order to verify the on-site integration between the Aperio GT 450 DX
scanner and the Sectra Workstation.
• View pathology images - Every pathologist should perform this test on review workstation
before reading pathology images using the subject device to ensure that all scanned slide
images have been imported and for every case, view the thumbnails in the pathology image
window to verify that each slide that should be in the case is present (manually verifying
tissue block and staining information from LIS).
Additional details of the quality control procedures are provided in the device User’s Guide
and the Installation Guide.

B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
a. A clinical study was conducted to demonstrate that viewing, reviewing and diagnosing WSIs
of H&E stained FFPE tissue slides using the DPAT (3.3) on Sectra Workstation UniView
(DPAT (3.3)-UniView) is non-inferior to glass slide reads using optical (light) microscopy.
The imaging pipeline/configuration in the clinical study used was as follows: Aperio GT 450
DX scanner images/SVS image format/ DPAT (3.3)-UniView/Chrome web
browser/DellU3223QE display.
b. Technical bench testing to demonstrate that DPAT (3.3) generates identical images in the
configurations that were not validated in the clinical study. The Aperio GT 450
DX/SVS/DPAT (3.3)-UniView/Chrome configuration which was the imaging pipeline
validated in the clinical study, was used as the reference configuration in the pixelwise
comparison study to validate the other 4 configurations as described in section b below.
a. Clinical Validation Study
A clinical study was conducted to demonstrate that using DPAT (3.3)-UniView for use in
primary diagnosis of FFPE tissue sections when used with the Aperio GT 450 DX scanner,
which generated WSIs in the SVS image file format is non-inferior to glass slide reads using
optical light microscopy (MSR).
The study included 258 randomly selected cases that represented a diverse mixture of pathologic
diagnoses and tissue/organ types. Case slides were scanned on the Aperio GT 450 DX scanner,
producing WSIs in the SVS format at 40x magnification. Three (3) reading pathologists (the
same pathologists who determined MSR diagnosis) at a single site reviewed all study cases using
DPAT (3.3) -UniView on the Microsoft Chrome web browser and a Dell U3223QE monitor per
user guide, to determine the WSIR diagnosis. The reading pathologists were masked to the
reference diagnoses, their own diagnoses from the previous studies and to other reading
pathologist’s study diagnoses. Across the 258 selected cases, all 870 WSIs were successfully
reviewed. The range of WSIs reviewed per case was 1 to 34.
The WSIR data from the current study and the existing MSR data (diagnoses, concordance
scores and consensus scores) from a previous clinical study (K190332) which had the same study
cases and readers as the current study were used to estimate study endpoints.
K232208 - Page 9 of 14

--- Page 10 ---
A minimum of two adjudicators independently assessed concordance (concordant, minor
discordance, major discordance) of the WSIR diagnosis against the reference diagnosis using
predefined rules. If consensus was not reached between the first 2 adjudicators, a third
adjudicator reviewed the study diagnosis against the reference diagnosis. If consensus between 2
of 3 adjudicators was still not reached, then the 3 adjudicators would convene as a panel to come
to a consensus for the major discordance status. WSIR diagnosis consensus scores were used to
estimate WSIR diagnosis major discordance rate. For MSR diagnoses, the consensus scores
generated during the previous clinical study (K190332) were used for this study to estimate MSR
diagnosis major discordance rate.
A major discordance was defined as a difference in diagnosis that resulted in a clinically
important difference in patient management, whereas a minor discordance would not be
associated with a clinically important difference in patient management. The adjudicators’
concordance scores for the same case were compared to determine a consensus score for major
discordance status [no major discordance (concordant or minor discordance) or major
discordance]. The diagnosis consensus scores were used to estimate WSIR diagnosis major
discordance rate.
Study Acceptance Criteria: The primary endpoint of the study was the difference in overall major
discordance rates between the 2 modalities [Whole slide image review (WSIR) using DPAT
(3.3)-UniView and MSR] when compared to the reference diagnosis (original sign-out
pathologic diagnosis) which was defined as the ground truth (GT) diagnosis. The secondary
endpoint of the study was the major discordance rate of WSIR diagnosis relative to the reference
diagnosis. The acceptance criteria associated with each study endpoint were as follows:
Primary Endpoint: The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference between the overall
major discordance rates of WSIR diagnosis and MSR diagnosis when compared to the reference
diagnosis shall be ≤4%.
Secondary Endpoints: The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the major discordance rate
between WSIR diagnosis and the reference diagnosis shall be ≤7%.
Adjudication Review: For WSIR, there were 767 study diagnoses reviewed by 2 (primary)
adjudicators. No diagnoses were deferred by the adjudicators; therefore, 767 WSIR diagnoses
had concordance scores. Of these, consensus on major discordance status was obtained for 736
(96.0%, 736/767) study diagnoses by 2 adjudicators only; 31 (4.0%, 31/767) study diagnoses
were transferred to a third adjudicator for review, after which consensus was obtained. No study
diagnoses required panel review. Adjudication of MSR diagnoses and generation of consensus
scores was conducted during the previous clinical study. All 764 MSR diagnoses were
successfully adjudicated and had consensus scores.
Study Results: All 774 case reads (258 cases × 3 reading pathologists) were successfully
performed by WSIR. Seven WSIR diagnoses were deferred (cases that could not be diagnosed
by the reading pathologists), resulting in 767 WSIR diagnoses sent for adjudication.
K232208 - Page 10 of 14

--- Page 11 ---
All 774 case reads were performed by MSR during the previous clinical study. Ten (10) MSR
diagnoses were deferred by the reading pathologists, resulting in 764 MSR diagnoses sent for
adjudication. Study results are shown in the table below.

MSRD vs GT 23/764 3.01 (1.65, 5.27)
Difference -0.1 (-1.71, 1.69)
The estimated difference in major discordance rates between the 2 modalities when compared to
the reference diagnosis was -0.01% (95% CI: -1.71% to 1.69%). The upper bound of the 95% CI
of the estimated difference in major discordance rates was 1.69% which met the predefined
acceptance criteria of ≤4% for the primary endpoint. The overall major discordance rate between
the WSIR diagnosis and the reference diagnosis did not exceed 7%; the upper bound of the 95%
CI for the overall estimated major discordance rate for WSIR diagnosis was 5.25%, which met
the predefined acceptance criteria of ≤7% as shown in the table below.

b. Bench Testing – Pixelwise comparison study
DPAT (3.3) supports multiple file formats, multiple viewers and multiple browsers, constituting
various configurations to be tested. The SVS/UniView/Chrome configuration imaging pipeline
was validated in the above clinical study. Therefore, it was used as the reference configuration in
the pixelwise comparison study to validate 4 additional configurations specified in the table below.

A total of 30 FFPE tissue slides from various human anatomic sites such as breast, prostate,
gastrointestinal tract, lung, ovary, lymph node, bone, etc. were used in the study. This sample set
was different from the sample set used in the clinical study.
The 30 glass slides were scanned with a Leica Aperio GT 450 DX scanner to generate WSI files in
the SVS and DICOM file formats. For each of the 30 slides, 3 regions of interests (ROIs) were
manually selected by qualified personnel to represent various features in the tissue samples. Blank
or blurry areas were excluded from the ROI selection. The ROIs were captured at 10x and 40x
magnification levels.
A total of 4 configurations specified in table 8 above were tested in the study. Each of these
configurations represented an imaging pipeline and consisted of the specific file format (SVS or
DICOM), viewer (IDS7 or UniView), and browser (Chrome or Edge).
The pixelwise comparison study was conducted in the intended computer environment following
the labeling of the subject and predicate devices, including the Dell U3223QE display, which has

3840x2160 pixels. For each configuration, 180 image-pairs (30 slides * 3 ROIs * 2 magnification
levels) were tested. For each comparison, screenshots were captured from the subject and predicate
devices to form an image-pair. Each image-pair was cropped and registered to be pixelwise
comparable. The cropped image included most of the pixels in the image except for those in the
viewer-specific user interface areas. The testing data, including the screenshots and
cropping/registration information of the 5 configurations were provided in the FDA specific format.
For each image-pair, the pixelwise differences between two images were calculated using the
CIEDE2000 color difference metric. Two images were considered to be identical if the 95th
percentile of the pixelwise color differences is less than 3 CIEDE2000 (< 3 ΔE ). A configuration
00
can be validated if all image-pairs are identical to the reference configuration.
Based on analysis of the testing data, the 4 configurations specified in table 9 below were identical,
i.e., < 3 ΔE to reference configuration SVS/UniView/Chrome.

c. Turnaround Time
The purpose of this test was to demonstrate that the turnaround time for rendering of images is
acceptable. Turnaround times for loading a new image, image panning and zooming for both
UniView and IDS7 were tested as well as opening images from SVS files and DICOM files. Test
results for different scenarios met the test acceptance criteria and showed acceptable turnaround
time for image loading.
d. Measurements (area and distance)
The purpose of this test was to demonstrate that DPAT (3.3) accurately shows measurement
annotations on scanned WSIs from the Aperio GT 450 DX scanner. Measurements in Uniview and
IDS7 on each of the 2 image file formats SVS and DICOM were evaluated. For each combination
(UniView/SVS, UniView/DICOM, IDS7/SVS and IDS7/DICOM), 6 measurements of 3 different
lengths in 2 different orientations (3 horizontal and 3 vertical) were performed using the built-in
measurement tool using the comparator and the DPAT (3.3). The results showed that the
measurement values agreed between the comparator and DPAT (3.3). DPAT (3.3) has been found
to perform accurate measurements with respect to its intended use.
e. Human Factors (Usability) Testing
Human factors study designed around critical user tasks and use scenarios performed by
representative users were conducted for previously cleared DPAT (2.2) in K193054. No new
human factor study was performed for DPAT (3.3).
