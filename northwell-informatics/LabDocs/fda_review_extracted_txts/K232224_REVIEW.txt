E Purpose for Submission:
Modifications to the device Instructions for Use to add U-100 Fiasp, in the Fiasp PumpCart
prefilled cartridge, as a compatible insulin for ages 6 years and older.
II Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The iLet Dosing Decision Software is intended for use with compatible integrated continuous
glucose monitors (iCGM) and alternate controller enabled (ACE) pumps. A self-monitoring of
blood glucose (SMBG) meter may also be used for manual input of blood glucose values to
continue insulin dosing for a limited period of time when input from the iCGM is temporarily not
available.

The iLet Dosing Decision Software autonomously determines and commands an increase,
decrease, maintenance, or suspension of all basal doses of insulin and autonomously determines
and commands correction doses of insulin based on input from an iCGM, and it autonomously
determines and commands meal doses of insulin based on meal announcements.
iLet Dosing Decision Software is intended for the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in
people 6 years of age or older. iLet Dosing Decision Software is intended for single patient use
and requires a prescription.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx – For prescription use only.
Do not use the iLet Dosing Decision Software if you are unable or unwilling to test blood
glucose (BG) levels with an SMBG meter when input from the iCGM is not available.
Do not use the iLet Dosing Decision Software if you are unable or unwilling to recognize and
respond to iLet safety alerts.
Do not use the iLet System if you are taking hydroxyurea, also known as Hydrea. This
medication is sometimes used in the treatment of blood disorders and some kinds of cancer. The
use of hydroxyurea can result in falsely elevated sensor glucose readings. The iLet System relies
on sensor glucose readings to adjust insulin, provide insulin doses, and provide high and low
glucose alerts. If the iLet System receives sensor readings that are higher than actual glucose
levels, it could result in missed hypoglycemia alerts and potential errors in diabetes management,
such as too much insulin being delivered. Hydroxyurea can also result in errors when reviewing,
analyzing, and interpreting historical patterns for assessing glucose control.
Do not use the iLet ACE Pump and Dosing Decision Software in people under 6 years of age.
The iLet ACE Pump and Dosing Decision Software have not been studied in these populations.
Do not use the iLet Dosing Decision Software in people who are pregnant, on dialysis or
critically ill. The iLet Dosing Decision Software has not been studied in these populations.
The system should NOT be used in hospitalized people as the safety of the technology has not
been evaluated in this population.
The iLet Dosing Decision Software is only for use with insulin U-100 lispro (Humalog), insulin
U-100 aspart (Novolog), or insulin U-100 aspart (Fiasp).
Do not use the iLet Dosing Decision Software with the U-100 Fiasp in individuals under 18
years of age. The iLet Dosing Decision Software has not been studied with the U-100 Fiasp in
these populations.
K232224 - Page 2 of 7

The iLet Dosing Decision Software is only for use with the Dexcom G6 iCGM. When using the
iLet device, wear an iCGM.
Remove the iLet device, steel infusion set, CGM sensor, and CGM transmitter before undergoing
radiation therapy, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or
diathermy treatment procedures. Exposure of the iLet device, steel infusion set, CGM sensor, or
CGM transmitter to any of these may damage them.
Do not expose your iLet device, steel infusion set, CGM transmitter, or CGM sensor to
equipment used in procedures for Pacemaker/Automatic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
(AICD) placement or reprogramming, Cardiac Catheterization, or Nuclear Stress Test.
The iLet Go App is compatible with the iOS platform. The iLet Go App provides the ability to
perform over-the-air updates and / or pull data from an iLet device to share with the Beta Bionics
Cloud. The iLet Go App is not currently compatible with Android or other platforms.
If your CGM is offline for an extended period of time, dosing will stop and you should switch to
alternative therapy until you are able to reconnect to a CGM sensor. A countdown timer will
appear before dosing would stop.
III Device Description
The iLet Dosing Decision software is part of the iLet Bionic Pancreas and is intended for use by
people with diabetes. The iLet Dosing Decision software works in conjunction with a compatible
alternate controller enabled (ACE) pump. The iLet Dosing Decision Software requires
initialization with the user’s body mass (body weight), as well as meal announcements. When
initiating a meal announcement with the iLet Dosing Decision Software, the user qualitatively
approximates carbohydrate content (meal size) relative to the usual carbohydrate content for each
of the three meal types (breakfast, lunch, or dinner). The iLet Dosing Decision Software
autonomously determine the size of the insulin dose in response to a meal announcement by the
user.
The iLet Dosing Decision software works to control glucose to a user-set glucose target of
“lower” (110 mg/dL), “usual” (120 mg/dL), or “higher” (130 mg/dL) within the device settings.
Users can also set glucose targets specific for sleep.
The iLet Dosing Decision software also includes a feature, called “BG-Run mode”, which
enables the device to continue insulin delivery in the event CGM-data is unavailable. Use of the
feature, however, should be temporary and always for the shortest duration possible, with the
goal to resume CGM-guided insulin dosing as soon as possible.

participated in the Standard Care Group (SC/control group) in the Bionic Pancreas (BP)
Pivotal trial, a prior 13-week multi-center, parallel group randomized control trial (RCT). In
the extension study, the RCT SC group was given the opportunity to use the insulin-only
configuration of the iLet BP system. All participants 6-17 years old (at time of consent for
the RCT) used study-provided U-100 Fiasp® PumpCart® (insulin aspart) in a pre-filled
1.6mL cartridge during the Extension Study.

a - A severe hypoglycemic event is defined as a hypoglycemic event that a) required assistance of
another person due to altered consciousness, and b) required another person to actively
administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.

polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting; b) serum ketones >1.5 mmol/L or large/moderate
urine ketones; c) either arterial blood pH <7.30 or venous pH <7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15;
and d) treatment provided in a health care facility.
c - A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that a) results in
death, b) is life-threatening, c) requires inpatient hospitalization of prolongation of existing
hospitalization, d) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions (sight threatening), e) is a congenital
anomaly or birth defect, or f) is considered a significant medical event by the investigator based
on medical judgment.
