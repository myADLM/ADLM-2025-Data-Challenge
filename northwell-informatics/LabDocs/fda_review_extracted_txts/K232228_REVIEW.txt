Configuration of the Multi-drug Urine Test Cup and Multi-drug Test Dip Card can consist of any
combination of the above listed drug analytes.
The test may yield positive results for the prescription drugs Buprenorphine, Oxazepam
Secobarbital and Oxycodone when taken at or above prescribed doses. It is not intended to
distinguish between prescription use or abuse of these drugs. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
the preliminary result is positive. The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method.
For prescription use only.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Multi-drug Urine Test Cup, Multi-drug Urine Test Dip Card, Accurature Multi-drug Urine Test
Cup, and Accurature Multi-drug Urine Test Dip Card are competitive binding, lateral flow
immunochromatographic assays for qualitative and simultaneous detection of Amphetamine,
Marijuana, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Morphine, Oxazepam, Oxycodone, Secobarbital,
Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxy-methamphetamine, Phencyclidine and Methadone in human
urine samples. The products are single-use in vitro diagnostic devices. The candidate device will
be sold in two formats: Multi-drug Urine Test Dip Card and Multi-drug Urine Test Cup.
B Principle of Operation:
The Multi-drug Urine Test Cup, Multi-drug Urine Test Dip Card, Accurature Multi-drug Urine
Test Cup, and Accurature Multi-drug Urine Test Dip Card are immunoassays based on the
competitive binding principle. Drugs that may be present in the urine specimen compete against
their respective drug conjugate for binding sites on their specific antibody. During testing, a
urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If present in the urine specimen below its
cutoff concentration, a drug will not saturate the binding sites of its specific antibody coated on
the particles. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by the immobilized drug
conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region of the specific drug strip.
The colored line will not form in the test line region if the drug level is above its cutoff
concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody coated on the particles.
A drug-positive urine specimen will not generate a colored line in the specific test line region of
the strip because of drug competition, while a drug negative urine specimen or a specimen
containing a drug concentration less than the cut-off will generate a line in the test line region,
To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control line region
indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

of -100% cutoff, - 75% cutoff, -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff, cutoff, +25% cutoff, +50% cutoff ,
+75% cutoff and +100% cutoff. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in negative

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-Reactivity:
To test cross-reactivity, drug metabolites and other structurally related compounds that
are likely to cross-react in urine samples were spiked into negative urine and were
tested using three lots of each device. The lowest concentration that caused a positive
result for each compound is listed below. The highest concentration tested is shown if no
cross reactivity was observed.

Interfering substances:
Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological
conditions were added to drug-free urine and urine samples with concentrations of the target
drugs at 25% below and 25% above Cutoff levels. These urine samples were tested using
three lots of each device. The compounds were tested at 100 µg/mL (unless otherwise noted
in the table). No interference was observed for any of the compounds tested, and the list of
compounds is provided in the following table.

Effect of Urinary Specific Gravity and pH:
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples, with specific
gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.035 or urine samples with pH ranging from 4 to 9 were
spiked with the target drugs to concentrations at 50% below and 50% above Cutoff levels.
These samples were tested using three lots of each device. Results were all positive for
samples at +50% Cutoff and all negative for samples at -50% Cutoff.
4. Assay Reportable Range:

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The device is traceable to commercially available reference materials.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Refer to Section VII.A.1
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison:
Method comparison studies were performed by three operators. Eighty (80) unaltered clinical
samples were run for each target drug. The samples were tested in a blinded fashion and
compared to LC/MS results. The results are presented in the tables below:

2. Lay user study
A lay user study was performed using the Multi-Drug Test Cup/Dip Card at three intended use
sites with 603 lay persons. The lay users had diverse ages and educational and professional
backgrounds. Urine samples were prepared at multiple concentrations (Negative (-100%), +/-
75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff) by spiking drugs into drug free pooled urine specimens. The
concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into
individual containers and tested in a blinded fashion.
