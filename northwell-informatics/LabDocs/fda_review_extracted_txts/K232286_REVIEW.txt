III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
The Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay is an automated, rapid multianalyte real-time PCR test for
the simultaneous qualitative detection and differentiation of herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes
simplex virus type 2, and varicella-zoster virus DNA isolated from human cutaneous or
mucocutaneous lesion samples obtained from symptomatic patients suspected of active herpes
simplex virus 1, herpes simplex virus 2 and/or varicella-zoster infection. This in vitro diagnostic
test is intended to aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs or symptoms of herpes simplex virus
type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, and varicella-zoster virus infection.
The Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay is intended to aid in the diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1,
herpes simplex virus 2 and varicella-zoster virus active infections. The results of this test should
not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions and must be
combined with clinical observations, patient history and/or epidemiological information.
Negative results do not preclude herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, or
varicella-zoster virus infection that is not detected by a cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesion swab
specimen. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other organisms. Additional
laboratory testing (e.g., viral culture, immunoassay, serology) may be necessary for patient
evaluation. Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay is for professional use. The Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV
Assay is intended for use only with the Savanna instrument.
Warning: The Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay is not intended for use with the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) or to aid in the diagnosis of HSV or VZV infection of the central nervous system (CNS).
The Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay is not intended for use in prenatal screening.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as Intended Use
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay amplifies and detects HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV viral DNA
isolated from cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesion samples obtained from symptomatic patients
suspected of active herpes simplex virus 1, herpes simplex virus 2 and/or varicella-zoster
infection.

External controls for HSV-1, HSV-2, or VZV (Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay Control Set which
contains positive and negative controls) serve as external processing and extraction controls in
verifying the performance of the Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay.
B Principle of Operation:
Patient sample is dispensed into the sample port of the Savanna cartridge and then placed
manually in the Savanna instrument. The Savanna instruments automates running of the assay
and result reporting.
The Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay consists of a single, self-contained assay cartridge and
employs real-time PCR technology for use with the Savanna instrument to detect and
differentiate DNA from herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2 and varicella-
zoster virus.
The Savanna platform extracts, amplifies and detects DNA present in cutaneous or
mucocutaneous lesion swab specimens obtained from symptomatic patients. Identification of
HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV occurs by the use of target-specific primers and fluorescent-labeled
probes that hybridize to conserved regions in the viral genomes.
There are two types of Quality Control for the Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay Cartridge: Built-in
Process Control and External Controls that are sold separately for use.
Interpretation of Results: The Savanna software automatically determines the specimen results
for each pathogen target ordered. The result for each target will be displayed as (Positive),
(Negative), or (Invalid).

5. Quality Control:
There are two types of Quality Control for the Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay Cartridge:
Built-in Process Internal Control and External Controls.
a) Process Internal Control (IC)
The Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay contains a process internal control (IC) for each chamber
in the cartridge. Internal control is co-processed, amplified and detected simultaneously with
the target DNAs, serving as an internal control to monitor sample processing, PCR inhibition,
integrity of assay reagents and the operation of the Savanna instrument proceeded correctly
for each sample.
b) External Controls
The Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Control Set contains a pouched Positive Swab and two buffer
tubes. The external Positive Control is intended to be used to monitor substantial reagent and
instrument failure. The external Negative Control is used to detect reagent or environmental
contamination (or carry-over) by pathogen amplicons.

a. Potential Cross-Reactivity: A study was performed to evaluate the performance of the
Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay in samples negative for HSV1, HSV2 and VZV
containing 60 microorganisms (virus, bacteria and fungus) that could be found in lesion
specimens. The microorganism were tested at clinically relevant levels of viruses and
bacteria: ≥106 CFU/mL or IFU/mL; viruses: ≥ 105 copies (cp), viral particles (vp) or
TCID /mL in negative buccal matrix or NBM. There was no cross-reactivity observed
50
with the 60 microorganisms tested with the Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay at the
concentrations indicated in the Table 6 below.

d. Competitive Interference: A competitive interference study was conducted to evaluate the
performance of the Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay using samples containing 2 target
analytes at different combination of high and low analyte concentrations. Each sample
was prepared with one of the analytes at 3X LoD and the other analytes at 10X, 500X or
1000X LoD in negative buccal matrix. Five replicates per sample were evaluated. When
competitive interference was observed (shaded in Table 8), titration of the high-level
analyte was done and tested. Results are listed in Table 8 below.

6. Detection Limit:
The limits of detection (LoD) for the Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay were determined using
two types/strains of HSV-1, two types/strains of HSV-2 and two types/strains of VZV,
serially diluted in negative matrix. The LOD is defined as the lowest concentration
at which at least 95% of all replicates tested positive. The LoD for each pathogen are listed
below in Table 9.

Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity): The inclusivity of the Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay was
further evaluated by functional testing of clinically relevant strains/isolates, in addition to
those strains used in the LOD study. The clinical panel consisted of 4 strains of HSV-1, 4
strains of HSV-2, and 5 strains of VZV at concentrations near the level of detection (LOD) of
the assay. The evaluated strains and the lowest concentration that achieved 100% reactivity
are shown in Table 10.

Lead Reviewer or Consulting Reviewer Comments for Internal Discussion Only
The transport media compatibility and stability study results are acceptable.
HSV-1 2, HSV-2, and VZV virus stocks (HSV-1 McIntyre, HSV-2 G and VZV Ellen)
were diluted to 2x LoD and 4x LoD concentrations in each of the 4 transport medium
pooled negative matrix (Copan UTM, Remel M4RT, Remel M5, and Remel M6) to create
positive samples. The negative sample consisted of negative buccal matrix.
The transport media systems containing the contrived samples were stored at three
different conditions: Condition 1) = room temperature (15°C) for 120 hours, Condition 2)
= 30°C for 120 hours, and Condition 3) = 2-8°C ± 3°C for 120 hours.
The data support that the Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay can be used with the evaluated
viral transport media types.

10. Carry-Over:
Potential carry-over and cross-contamination for the Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay was
evaluated by alternate testing replicates of negative and high positive samples. The negative
samples consisted of negative buccal matrix. Positive samples consisted of HSV-1, HSV-2,
and VZV in pooled negative buccal matrix at concentrations greater or equal to 10x LoD
each analyte. All negative samples reported negative results, resulting in an overall
carryover rate of 0.0% . No carry over or cross contamination was observed.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Performance characteristics of the Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay were established through 2
clinical studies, as described below. Clinical Study 1 evaluated assay performance from fresh
samples while clinical study 2 evaluated performance after samples were stored frozen.
Clinical Study #1
A multi-site study was performed in the United States to evaluate the Savanna HSV
1+2/VZV Assay using freshly collected cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesion samples in
transport media. Five hundred and ninety (590) residual specimens were randomly selected
from all comers for standard of care testing of patients with signs and symptoms of HSV-1,
HSV-2 or VZV infection. Testing was split across three clinical sites and 44 Savanna
instruments. Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Control Sets were tested each day by the clinical sites
during sample testing.
The specimens have been categorized as cutaneous (skin lesion, genital), or mucocutaneous
(anorectal, genital, nares, ocular, oral and urethral). The gender and age demographics for
each category are listed in Table 12 below.

The Clinical Study #1 clinical performance results compared to commercially available RT-
PCR comparator method are shown in Tables 13 to 15. The clinical performance of the
Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV Assay was established by comparing to an FDA-cleared nucleic acid
amplification test in freshly collected cutaneous and mucocutaneus specimens analyzed
separately.

Clinical Study #2
Analysis of residual frozen cutaneous and mucocutaneous swab samples in transport medium
was performed to supplement Clinical Study #1. The samples were residual specimens left
over from testing of patients with signs and symptoms of HSV-1, HSV-2 or VZV infection.
The total number of evaluable samples was 154. The clinical performance of the Savanna
HSV 1+2/VZV Assay was established by comparing to an FDA-cleared nucleic acid
amplification test in frozen residual cutaneous and mucocutaneus specimens separately.
Results are shown in Table 16.
