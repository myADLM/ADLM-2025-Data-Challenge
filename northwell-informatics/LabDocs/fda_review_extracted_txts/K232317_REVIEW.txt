IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The UC-1800 Automatic Urine Analyzer is used together with the URIT 11FA and the URIT 12
FA test strips for semi-quantitative or qualitative detection of ascorbic acid, microalbumin,
leukocytes, creatinine, ketone, urobilinogen, bilirubin, glucose, protein, specific gravity, blood,
and pH in urine and for qualitative determination of nitrite in urine. The urine hydrometer
(optional) can determine the specific gravity, color and turbidity of urine.

semi-quantitative tests for microalbumin, leukocytes, creatinine, ketone, urobilinogen, bilirubin,
glucose, protein, specific gravity, blood and pH in urine and for qualitative determination of
nitrite. Measured results are printed through either the built-in printer or an external printer.
B Principle of Operation:
Test strip measurement principle
The strips are used to determine the components to be measured in urine by dry chemistry
methods together with the urine analyzer. Various components to be tested in urine can result in
changes to the colors of corresponding reagent blocks on the Urine Reagent Strips. The depth of
reaction color is proportional to the concentration of the corresponding component to be tested in
the urine. Measurement of test strips is conducted by the analyzer using the reflective
photoelectric colorimetry method using CIS (contact image sensor) image scanning analysis
technology for detection.
URIT 11FA and 12FA Urine Reagent Strips
Ascorbic Acid (URIT 11FA only): Based on the principle of Tillman’s Reagent, Ascorbic acid
can reduce the dye from blue to red.
Nitrite: In this reaction, nitrate is reduced to nitrite by Gram-negative bacteria in the urine, the
nitrite will react with arsanilic acid to form a diazonium compound, and the diazonium
compound will be combined with naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride to show a pink
color.
Microalbumin: Based on the dye-binding method, microalbumin can react with the dye to form
a pink complex and produce a color change.
Leukocytes: Based on the esterase method, granulosa cytoplasm contains esterase, which can
hydrolyze a 3-hydroxyindoxyl ester substrate, release phenol, and react with diazo reagent to
generate purple-red compounds.
Creatinine: Based on the principle of displacement reaction, creatinine can displace the dye in
the metal chloride-acid dye complex, and the color will change from green to yellow.
K232317 - Page 4 of 33

--- Page 5 ---
Ketone: Based on the principle of sodium nitro prussiate method, sodium nitroprusside can
interact with ketone (acetoacetate) under alkaline conditions to become purple. Acetoacetate is
particularly sensitive to this.
Urobilinogen: Based on the principle of the azo-binding method, urobilinogen is coupled with
diazonium salt under strong acid conditions to form carmine pigment.
Bilirubin: Based on the principle of the azo-coupling method, 2,4-dichloroaniline diazonium salt
can react specifically with bilirubin and produce different colors depending on the concentration
of bilirubin.
Glucose: Based on the reaction principle of the glucose oxidase method, glucose oxidase can
specifically oxidize β-D-glucose to generate glucuronic acid and hydrogen peroxide that will
oxidize the indicator under the action of peroxidase and show a purple-red color.
Protein: Based on the principle of protein error method of dye binding, the protein can combine
with the dye to form a complex that produces a color change. The response to albumin is more
sensitive than that of globulin, hemoglobin, Bence-Jones, protein, and mucin.
Blood: Based on the principle of hemoglobin contact activity method, the decomposition of
peroxides can be catalyzed through the peroxidase-like action of hemoglobin, thus oxidizing and
coloring tetramethylbenzidine.
Specific Gravity: The test uses the polyelectrolyte method based on the principle of ion
exchange between electrolytes in urine and polyelectrolytes. In the presence of cations, the
polymer hydrogen ions will be released through exchange, and the color of bromothymol blue
indicator will change from blue to blue-green and finally to yellow.
pH: The pH value within the range from 5.0 to 9.0 is measured by a Ph indicator.
UC-1800 Automatic Urine Analyzer
Measurement of test strips is performed by the reflectance photometry method. During the
measurement, the reacted pads on strip (the calibration pad is not involved in reaction, just for
reference) will change colors and absorb irradiated monochromatic light as a result of chemical
reaction within 60 seconds. Then the optical mechanism will compare the amount of reflective
light from each reacted pad with the reflective light of the calibration pad. The concentrations of
analytes will be calculated by CPU and printed together with semi-quantitative symbols. The
measuring system consists of a light source (LED) and a light receptor. The light from the light
source shines on the reacted pads and the calibration pad on the strip. The absorbed and reflected
light amounts vary with the color of the reagent pads. If the color is darker, more light is
absorbed, and less light is reflected, and vice versa. (i.e., the degree of color development is
proportional to the concentration of analyzes in urine).
Turbidity measurement principle: The turbidity module emits light through the sample and
then detects how much light is scattered by the particles in the water at a 90° angle to the
incident light.
Color measurement principle: The urine color can be detected by the professional color
recognition sensor (filter).

C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
UC-1800 Automatic Urine Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Urine identification can be performed manually or with analyzer barcode reader.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The UC-1800 Automatic Urine Analyzer is characterized by fully automated operation.
Samples can be labeled with a barcode, which is read with a barcode reader. The instrument
automatically performs a series of operations: sample transmitting, sample aspirating, sample
dropping, rinsing, strip sorting, strip feeding, color identifying, and measurement. Specimen
handling recommendations are provided in the labeling.
4. Calibration:
It is recommended to use the URIT specific gravity, turbidity, and color calibration products
to calibrate the physical module every 4 weeks. A white calibration strip is used to check the
remittance outputs of the LEDs in the read head. Labeling recommends that the user perform
calibration verification with the white strip after maintenance, with a new lot of strips, with a
new bottle of strips, when changing operators, or when questioning results.
5. Quality Control:
Urinalysis controls are intended for the urine analyzer and matched urine reagent strips to
monitor the quality of the urinalysis test. The following quality controls are recommended:
Urinalysis Control NO.I: Negative control
Urinalysis Control NO.II: Positive control
Urinalysis Control NO.III: Positive control for Ascorbic Acid only
Quality Control Solution TUR for turbidity
Quality Control Solution COL for color

The Reproducibility (Between-Run) Precision of the candidate device was evaluated by
using negative human urine samples and spiked urine samples for each analyte. Each sample
was tested for 20 days with 2 runs per day, 1 replicate per run using 3 lots of URIT 11FA
Urine Reagent Strips and 3 lots of URIT 12FA Urine Reagent Strips on 3 instruments (one
lot of URIT 11FA and one lot of URIT 12FA test strips each instrument) in 3 sites (one
instrument per site) for a total of 120 measurements at each concentration. The representative
results are summarized in the tables below.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Exogenous and Endogenous Interference
Analytical specificity studies were conducted to evaluate interfering effects of exogenous and
endogenous substances on the candidate device. Negative urine samples and low positive
samples were spiked with potential interfering substances at various interferent
concentrations. Each sample pair (test sample and control sample) was analyzed in replicates
of 5 on two UC-1800 Automatic Urine Analyzers with two lots of URIT 11FA and 12FA
reagent strips respectively (2 lots of each reagent strip on each analyzer). Results are
summarized in the tables below.
The following substances show no interference at tested concentrations:
Substance Highest Concentration with No Interference
Cefoxitin 1200 mg/dL
Ofloxacin 90 mg/dL
Phenazopyridine 30 mg/dL
Salicylic acid 600 mg/dL
Tetracycline 50 mg/dL

To address the interference of levodopa on the test for blood, the following interference
limitation is included in the labeling and will be reported in the test report: Levodopa can
interfere with the detection of red blood cells leading to a false negative result.
Interference effect of urine pH
Studies were conducted to assess the effect of urine pH on the test results. For all test strip
analytes, except leukocytes and specific gravity, there was no interference from pH across a
range of 4.5 to 8.5. Interference effects of urine pH on leukocytes and specific gravity are
summarized in the table below.

Interference effect of urine color
The candidate device includes a correction function for urine colors. The results of the
studies demonstrated that the colors red, orange, brown, yellow, green, blue, and purple do
not significantly impact the results for the analytes on the URIT 11FA and 12 FA test strips
since all results were within +/- 1 color block when testing colored urine for these parameters
on the URIT 11FA and 12FA Urine Reagent Strips.
Interference effect of urine Specific Gravity
Studies were conducted to assess the effect of urine specific gravity on the test results. A
negative urine sample was prepared using sodium chloride to adjust the specific gravity to
1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030, 1.035, 1.040, 1.045, and 1.050, respectively. For all
test strip analytes, except leukocytes, there was no interference from specific gravity across a
range of 1.005 to 1.050. For leukocytes, false negative results were found at urine specific
gravity values higher than 1.040.

positive. Each analyte was added to a negative urine sample to prepare five different
concentrations. Each concentration was tested on three UC-1800 analyzers with three lots of
test strips. Each lot of test strip was tested 20 times on each analyzer. The results are
summarized below:
URIT Urine Reagent Strips
Analyte
11FA 12FA
Ascorbic acid 8~10 mg/dL N/A
Nitrite 0.1-0.2mg/dL
Microalbumin N/A 20-30 mg/L
Leukocyte 10~15 leu/mcL
Creatinine N/A 25~50 mg/dL
Ketone 4~5 mg/dL
Urobilinogen 1~2 EU/dL
Bilirubin 0.4~0.5 mg/dL
Glucose 40~50 mg/dL
Protein 10~15 mg/dL
Blood 5~10 ery/mcL
Analytical sensitivity is not applicable for both strips in the detection of pH and Specific
Gravity.
Study 2 – Measurement block cut-off:
A cut-off study was conducted on the candidate device to determine the cut-off concentration
between each semi-quantitative block of the reagent strip. The cut-off concentration is
defined as the minimum sample concentration at which a test result of ≥55% relative to the
transition from the block is considered positive. Each testing analyte was added to the
negative urine sample to have five concentrations exceeding the expected cut-off
concentration. Three lots of URIT 11FA and 12FA urine reagent strips were tested in 20
replicates at each concentration level on three UC-1800 urine analyzers.
The cut-off concentration between each measurement block is summarized in the tables
below.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
See Method Comparison.
9. Carry-Over:
The carryover of the candidate device was evaluated by alternately testing high-concentration
samples and low-concentration samples, in the sequence of high, low, high, low, high, low,
high, low, high and low. For all analytes, all negative/normal samples read as
negative/normal, therefore no significant carryover found in the study.
