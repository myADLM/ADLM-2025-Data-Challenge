B Indication(s) for Use:
Copan Universal Transport Medium (UTM-RT) System is intended for the collection and transport
of clinical specimen containing viruses, chlamydiae, mycoplasma or ureaplasma from the
collection site to the testing laboratory. UTM-RT can be processed using standard clinical
laboratory operating procedures for viral, chlamydial, mycoplasma and ureaplasma culture.
UTM-RT is intended for the stabilization and transportation of an unprocessed upper respiratory
clinical specimen suspected of containing respiratory viruses’ nucleic acids. UTM-RT is intended
for use with compatible molecular assays.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx – For Prescription Use Only
Do not freeze specimens intended to be processed for nucleic acids investigations. Stability of
nucleic acids when frozen in UTM-RT has not been evaluated and validated.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The candidate device, Copan UTM-RT, is provided in a screw capped, conical bottom,
polypropylene tube filled with 3mL of UTM-RT transport medium. Copan UTM-RT is supplied
in either of two (2) configurations, namely, medium tube alone in a paper-film peel pouch (bulk
configuration), or medium tube accompanied by sterile flocked swab in a peel pouch for specimen
collection (kit configuration). In the kit configuration, the flocked swab is available in three (3)
shapes—i.e., regular, minitip, and minitip flexible —that are suitable for specimen collection from
various sites on patient, including the upper respiratory cavity. Further, the medium tube for both
the swab configurations above can be provided with or without glass beads inside. The medium
tube with beads will be distinguished from tube without beads by the wording “with beads” written
in the product description on tube and external labels, as well as in other labeling materials.
The screw cap of the UTM-RT medium tube has a unique internal molded design that is able to
capture a swab shaft when the shaft is broken off into the tube and cap is closed. The flocked
specimen collection swab (provided sterile in a paper-peel pouch with UTM-RT medium in the kit
configuration) has a tip flocked with nylon fiber and a solid plastic shaft with a molded breaking
point. The nylon flocked swab along with its plastic shaft is the only component that may come in
transient (typically < 1 minute) contact with patient tissue (e.g., mucosal surfaces) during use in
specimen collection. After the specimen is collected, the swab shaft is broken off at the breaking
point such that the swab with the collected specimen remains within the medium tube.
B Principle of Operation:
The UTM-RT medium is designed to maintain the integrity and viability of viruses, chlamydiae,
mycoplasma, or ureaplasma and the integrity of nucleic acids for upper respiratory viruses.

validation data from the original clearance remains appropriate to support an 18-month shelf
life claim for the candidate device.

3. Detection Limit:
Performance Testing – Culture Recovery Studies:
Performance of the Copan Universal Transport Medium (UTM-RT) System was evaluated by
culture-based recovery studies for viral and bacterial test strains under and the results were
deemed acceptable during the clearance of the original device, K042970. Since the medium
tube (container), UTM-RT media composition, and other kit components remain unchanged,
and no extension of the specimen stability is being claimed, a new set of performance
evaluation for specimen stability via culture recovery is not required for the current candidate
device (K232357).
Performance Testing – Nucleic Acid Stability Studies:
To support the new intended use claim, “UTM-RT is intended for the stabilization and
transportation of an unprocessed upper respiratory clinical specimen suspected of containing
respiratory viruses’ nucleic acids. UTM-RT is intended for use with compatible molecular
assays”, the sponsor conducted fresh studies to determine the LoD of molecular detection of
three (3) representative target viral nucleic acids—namely, Influenza A, Influenza B, and
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)—followed by specimen stability studies in the candidate
transport medium system. These stability studies, performed both in cold (2–8oC) and at room
temperature (22–28oC), utilized variously aged lots (as available) of UTM-RT provided in
medium tubes with and without glass beads as shown below in Table 1.
Table 1: Use of UTM-RT media lots in stability studies
Number of lots
Lot age Lot age (in months from
UTM-RT used (as
designation production) at testing

Four (4) New 1–4.2
With Beads Two (2) Middle-Aged 12.9–13.5
Nine (9) Old / Expired 20.3–22.7
Three (3) New 0.8–1.4
Without Beads Three (3) Middle-Aged 11.1–13.3
Three (3) Old / Expired 18.7–19.6
Further, the LoD and stability studies with the candidate device were performed in an artificial
nasopharyngeal/nasal (referred to as “NPS/NS”) fluid matrix. This simulated matrix was
previously qualified as an appropriate matrix when used with Copan UTM/VTM since this was
shown to be equivalent to clinical nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal matrices in Sample Matrix
and Transport Media Equivalency studies performed to support clearance of the Cepheid Xpert
Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus Assay (K231481). Therefore, the use of the same simulated matrix
to support this transport medium candidate device was deemed appropriate, and the studies
were designed and conducted accordingly.
As shown in the following summary Tables 2–4, the freshly performed stability tests with
representative viral targets (as indicated above) demonstrated specimen stability for up to 96
hours during storage and/or transport at a temperature range of 2–25oC in UTM-RT tubes with
or without glass beads. Samples were tested using a compatible, representative, FDA-cleared
molecular assay (i.e., Cepheid Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus Assay in combination with
GeneXpert Dx) following the molecular assay’s package insert. The cycle threshold (Ct) values
were used to assess performance and calculate the difference in Ct values (ΔCt) at tested time

for subsequent testing in a compatible molecular assay. Especially, frozen storage of specimens
in UTM-RT at or below −70oC for testing with a molecular assay has not been validated and
is not recommended. However, it is acceptable to store specimens in UTM-RT at or below
−70oC for subsequent processing using virus, chlamydiae, mycoplasma, and ureaplasma
culture, as was previously cleared (K042970). This distinction is noted in device labeling.
