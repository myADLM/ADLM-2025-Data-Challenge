correction factor), extension of the maximum bolus duration, availability of temporary basal
rates with Closed-Loop active, and elimination of the prior hourly basal rate limit.
II Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Control-IQ technology is intended for use with compatible integrated continuous glucose
monitors (iCGM) and alternate controller enabled (ACE) pumps to automatically increase,
decrease, and suspend delivery of basal insulin based on iCGM readings and predicted glucose
values. It can also deliver correction boluses when the glucose value is predicted to exceed a
predefined threshold.

Control-IQ technology is intended for the management of Type 1 diabetes mellitus in persons 2
years of age and greater.
Control-IQ technology is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Due to an administrative error, a special condition for use limiting use to the Dexcom G6 iCGM
was erroneously included and is now removed.
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Only use U-100 Humalog or U-100 NovoLog with your pump. Only U-100 Humalog and
NovoLog have been tested and found to be compatible for use in the pump. Use of insulin with
lesser or greater concentration can result in under delivery or over delivery of insulin. This can
cause hypoglycemia (low BG) or hyperglycemia (high BG) events.
When the CGM reading is automatically populated into the bolus calculator, only the current
CGM reading is used to calculate the correction bolus. The trend arrow is not used in the dose
calculation. Speak with your healthcare provider for recommendations on how best to utilize the
arrows for your correction bolus dosing.
Control-IQ technology should not be used in anyone under the age of two years old. Control-IQ
technology should also not be used in patients who require less than a total daily insulin dose of
5 units per day or who weigh less than 20 pounds, as those are the required minimum values
needed in order for Control-IQ technology to operate safely.
When using the Control IQ algorithm, wear an iCGM.
The t:slim X2 pump, transmitter, and sensor must be removed before Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI), and Computed Tomography (CT) scan. Exposure to MRI, CT, or diathermy
treatment can damage the components.
DO NOT use Control-IQ technology if you are taking hydroxyurea, a medication used in the
treatment of diseases including cancer and sickle cell anemia. Your Dexcom G6 CGM readings
may be falsely elevated and result in over-delivery of insulin that could result in severe
hypoglycemia.
III Device Description
Control-IQ technology (Control-IQ, the device) is a software-only device intended for use by
people with diabetes. The device controls insulin delivery from a compatible alternate controller
enabled insulin pump (ACE pump) based on inputs provided by a compatible integrated
continuous glucose monitor (iCGM) and inputs provided the user (e.g., carbohydrate intake,
exercise, and sleep schedule). Control-IQ technology is meant to be installed on a compatible
ACE pump.
K232382 - Page 2 of 15

--- Page 3 ---
Control-IQ technology works to control glucose towards a glucose target range of 112.5-160
mg/dL during normal use. Glucose targets are not customizable but can be changed by a user if
sleep or exercise modes are set or announced. During sleep mode, this range is changed to 112.5-
120 mg/dL, and it is changed to 140-160 mg/dL during exercise mode.
Control-IQ technology includes an integrated feature whereby iCGM values are automatically
populated into the glucose field of the integrated bolus calculator when the Control-IQ
technology is active (i.e., the device is operating in closed-loop mode). This feature is disabled
when Control-IQ is turned off.
Using Control-IQ technology requires that users input their weight and their total daily insulin
requirement, which should be established with the help of a health care provider before using the
device.

VI Performance Characteristics:
A. Analytical Performance
For the purposes of analytical and clinical validation testing, the Control-IQ algorithm was
installed on the t:slim X2 Insulin Pump with Interoperable Technology ACE pump
(K232380), which was paired with the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring system
(K223931).
B. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data
1. Summary of Clinical Testing
The sponsor conducted a 13-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) in subjects 2 to 6 years
old with type 1 diabetes to evaluate the performance of the original Control-IQ algorithm
(i.e., Control-IQ 1.0 and the predicate device and not the modified 1.5 version that is the
subject of this clearance) to support the expansion of the age indication of this device to
include Type 1 diabetes users down to 2 years old. The sponsor then conducted an Extension
Phase of the pivotal study in which all subjects who participated in the RCT transitioned to
Control-IQ 1.5 for 13 weeks. This version of Control-IQ 1.5 (device being cleared) does not
alter the control algorithm of the device itself, rather, it includes a wider range for several
configurable parameters (e.g., weight, total daily insulin, etc.) which are intended to make the
system amenable to address the unique needs of very insulin sensitive and very insulin
resistant users. The sponsor refers to this updated version as Control-IQ 1.5 in the clinical
performance section of the device user guide. To be consistent with the user guide of the
subject device, throughout this section of the document, we refer to it as Control IQ 1.5.
After the Extension Phase was completed, the sponsor offered study subjects the opportunity
to continue using the Control-IQ 1.5. This phase is being referred to as Extended Use phase.
This phase ran for in two phases, first for 13 weeks, following which it continued with fewer
patients for another 13 weeks.
In summary, the clinical data to support the age expansion in the IFU of the device is
comprised of (1) the RCT comparing previously cleared Control-IQ (K200467) with standard
care, (2) the Extension phase prospectively evaluating the performance of Control-IQ 1.5 by
users who were already experienced in using the cleared Control-IQ 1.0 in the RCT as well
as subjects naïve to Control-IQ 1.0 who continued to use standard care (e.g. multiple daily
injections and insulin pump use that do not possess the hybrid closed loop capabilities that
Control-IQ offers) during the RCT, and (3) the prospective evaluation for up to 1 year,
referred to as Extended Use of Control-IQ 1.5 primarily for safety of the same subjects who
had used the modified Control-IQ for 13 weeks in the Expansion Phase. Further details about
the study is provided below.

Ancillary Meal Challenges
The sponsor also provided the incorporation of stress challenges during the Extension Phase to
further characterize the safety of the modified Control-IQ glycemic controller by evaluating the
potential risks of device use in less frequently encountered, but plausible scenarios. The
challenges included 38 of the Extension Phase study subjects using predicate device and
consisted of a missed meal bolus, full meal bolus + exercise, and an exercise only challenge.
Glycemic control was not optimal during stress challenges as observed during non‐stress periods
but the trends were within ranges to be expected during these challenges. The sponsor reported
no events of severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia/ketosis/DKA during or after (including
overnight) any of the challenges.
Extended Use Study
The sponsor also provided clinical data for the Extended Use period in which 80 of the original
96 subjects in the Extension Phase opted to continue using Control-IQ 1.5. Some subjects used
Control-IQ 1.5 for 3 to < 6 months (35 subjects of 102 from the original RCT, 34%) and 6 to <9
months (49 subjects of 102 from the original RCT, 48%). Sixty (60) subjects completed 13
weeks and ten (10) subjects completed 26 weeks of the Extended use Phase although 43 subjects
continued with Control-IQ 1.5 beyond 13 weeks, but completed their final study visit sometime
before 26 weeks. The reported CGM‐metrics and safety data from the extended phase is
consistent with the observed performance of Control-IQ 1.5 in the Extension study and further
supports that the updated iAGC is generally comparable and no worse than Control-IQ 1.0 as
observed in the RCT Phase of the PEDAP study.
Safety Results for PEDAP Study including Extension Phase and Extended Use
Since the extension phase involved those receiving standard care in the first 13 weeks to cross
over to using the Control-IQ hence the extension phase and the subsequent extended use phases
safety results have been presented in a combined fashion. Note that the first 13 weeks of the
Extended Use study had 80 participants following which 52 participants completed the second
13-week period of the Extended Use Study.

Higher IQ Study Using Control-IQ1.5
The sponsor conducted a small study to address the safety of modified configurable parameters
that aim to improve the user experience for T1D individuals with insulin resistance. The changes
from Control-IQ 1.0 to Control-IQ 1.5 include (1) allowed entry of a maximum body weight up
to 440 pounds, (2) allowing a basal rate of 3 units/hour to continue from manual mode when
users activate CIQ 1.5, (3) enabling use of temp rates during Control-IQ 1.5 active, (4) enabling
extended bolus delivery with Control-IQ 1.5 being active. Subjects in this study were allowed to
continue medications for glucose control and or weight loss. Fifteen subjects in this study used a
basal rate >3 units/hour 24 hours per day during the study

Safety Results for Higher IQ study
There were no severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis events, and one serious
adverse event of Atrial Fibrillation during the non-challenge period. This serious adverse
event was unrelated to both the study procedures and the investigative device. There was a
total of 37 non-serious adverse events, but majority were unrelated to the study procedure
and the device.
Additional Study
The lead‐in period of another study that included 179 subjects who used Control IQ 1.5 with
Humalog was used in the substantial equivalence determination. This study required every
subject to complete a no‐bolus meal challenge and an extended 2‐hour exercise challenge
was also included to provide safety data in those stress scenarios for the subject device. The
sponsor reported the results for pediatrics (6 to <14-year-old) and adults (≥14 years old).
Since all subjects in this study were already Control IQ users, the HbA1c was well controlled
with only 57 of 179 subjects (32%) screening into the study with an HbA1c of ≥7.5%. The
sponsor reported time in range 70‐180 mg/dL in the ≥ 14-year-old cohort (N=70) of 69% +/‐
13% and 62% +/‐ 15% in the 6 to <14-year-old subject cohort which is similar to the values
used for > 6-year-old in the predicate device. The sponsor reported % time <70 mg/dL and
<54 mg/dL as low (<1%) which is also consistent with prior evaluations of predicate device.
Additional safety data in this 6- to 81-year-old cohort from the no‐bolus challenge and
extended exercise challenge did not yield any severe hypoglycemia or DKA events including
in the overnight period after the challenge was completed.
Postmarket Surveillance Study:
There is uncertainty remaining regarding the risk/benefit profile of the device when used in
the broader intended use population. While the premarket clinical study provided to support
this premarket notification showed some benefits, the study included device users and their
caregivers with relatively high levels of education relative to the general use population, and
it was not adequately powered to assess differences in the rates of safety events (e.g., diabetic
ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia). Furthermore, due to the nature of the study design,
the apparent unfavorable difference in the rates of hyperglycemia/ketosis events (not rising to
the level of severity of diabetic ketoacidosis) between the treatment and control arms may be
due to reporting differences between users rather than a true difference from the device itself.
Accordingly, the manufacturer will be performing a post-market surveillance study with
subjects ages 2-5 years old.
2. Human Factors
The summative human factors study conducted under DEN190034 included assessment of
the 2–6-year pediatric age group and their care providers, and the results were found to be
acceptable.
