III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
ETEST is a manual, quantitative technique for determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of
non-fastidious Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobic bacteria and fastidious bacteria. The
system comprises a predefined antibiotic gradient which is used to determine the Minimum
Inhibitory Concentration (MIC, in μg/mL) of different antimicrobial agents against
microorganisms tested on agar media after overnight incubation.
Sulbactam/Durlobactam has been shown to be active against the Gram-negative aerobic
microorganisms listed below according to the FDA label for this antimicrobial agent.
ETEST SUD can be used to determine the MIC of Sulbactam/Durlobactam against the following
microorganisms:
Active both in vitro and in clinical infections:
• Acinetobacter baumanii-calcoaceticus complex
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Due to the occurrence of a very major error with Sulbactam-Durlobactam (1/43 resistant
isolates), isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex that provide an MIC of 4
μg/mL should be retested by an alternate method, if critical to patient care.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Manual reading only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
ETEST is a thin, inert and non-porous plastic strip carrying the MIC reading scale in μg/mL on
one side and a predefined antibiotic gradient on the other side.
The ETEST gradient technology is based on a combination of the concepts of dilution
and diffusion principles for susceptibility testing.
The ETEST consists of a thin, inert, nonporous plastic strip that is used to determine the
antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria. One side of the strip carries the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) reading scale expressed in μg/mL. The other side of the
strip contains a predefined continuous exponential gradient of antibiotic concentrations.
K232395 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
ETEST Sulbactam/Durlobactam contains a range of Sulbactam from 0.004 to 64 μg/mL and
Durlobactam at a fixed concentration of 4 μg/mL.
B Principle of Operation:
When the ETEST strip is applied to an inoculated agar surface, the preformed antibiotic gradient
immediately transfers into the agar matrix, then forming a stable, continuous and exponential
gradient of antibiotic concentrations directly underneath the strip. Bacteria growth becomes
visible during incubation, and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip appears.
After incubation, the MIC value is read from the scale in terms of μg/mL at complete inhibition
of bacterial growth, where the pointed end of the ellipse intersects the strip. Since ETEST
generates MIC values which fall between two-fold dilutions for interpretation, the MIC value
read must be recorded to the next two-fold dilution.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was conducted at three sites using 15 on-scale Acinetobacter
baumanii-calcoaceticus complex isolates (10 A. baumannii, 3 A. pittii and 2 A.
nosocomialis). Each isolate was tested in triplicate over three days for a total of 405 data
points. The mode MIC value was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was
calculated based on the number of MIC values that fell within ±1 doubling dilution of the
mode. All MIC results were on scale. The testing resulted in overall reproducibility of greater
than 95%. The results were acceptable.
2. Linearity:
N/A
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
N/A
4. Assay Reportable Range:

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Inoculum Density Check:
The inoculum was prepared to achieve turbidity equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard.
Colony counts were performed periodically at each site for all QC replicates, from at least
one replicate of each reproducibility isolate on each of the three days of testing, and from a
minimum of 10% of the clinical and challenge strains tested. The inoculum densities were
acceptable.
Purity Check:
Verification of isolate purity was conducted on all clinical, challenge, QC and reproducibility
organism suspensions for each ETEST and from each growth control well of the broth
microdilution reference panel. All organism suspensions for both the broth microdilution
reference panels and ETEST were pure.

• Incubation: 35º±2º C for 20-24 hours
Clinical testing was performed at three external sites (Two US sites and one OUS site) and
one internal site with both ETEST Sulbactam-Durlobactam and the reference method using a
total of 461 Acinetobacter-baumannii calcoaceticus complex (ABC complex) (364 A.
baumannii, 5 A. calcoaceticus, 1 A. dijkshoorniae, 65 A. pittii, 25 A. nosocomialis and 1
other ABC complex) clinical isolates. The clinical testing included 29.5% contemporary
(136/461; isolated no longer than 6 months prior to testing) and 70.5% stock (325/461; no
time limit on time from isolation prior to testing) clinical isolates. A total of 101 ABC
complex (81 A. baumannii, 10 A. pittii and 10 A. nosocomialis) challenge isolates were also
evaluated at one internal site using ETEST Sulbactam-Durlobactam and the reference
method.
In total, the comparative study included clinical and challenge isolates as follows: 562 ABC
complex isolates. They were: A. baumannii (445), A. calcoaceticus (5), A. dijkshoorniae (1),
A. pittii (75), A. nosocomialis (35) and other ABC complex (1).
The performance of the 562 clinical and challenge isolates is summarized in Table 3.

Essential Agreement (EA) is when the ETEST Sulbactam-Durlobactam results agree exactly or within one
doubling dilution of the reference broth microdilution results. Category Agreement (CA) is when the ETEST
Sulbactam-Durlobactam result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference broth microdilution result
interpretation.
ETEST Sulbactam-Durlobactam performance for all ABC complex isolates (clinical and
challenge) is acceptable with an EA of 97.7% and CA of 98.4%. There was no major error.
One very major error was observed among 43 ABC complex resistant isolates (1/43 = 2.3%).
This very major error was only due to an A. baumannii isolate. To mitigate the potential for
occurrence of these errors, the sponsor included the following statement in the Limitation
section of the device labeling:

Due to the occurrence of a very major error with Sulbactam-Durlobactam (1/43 resistant
isolates), isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex that provide an
MIC of 4 μg/mL should be retested by an alternate method, if critical to patient care.
Inoculator and ETEST Strip Applicator Options:
Culture media plates for ETEST can be inoculated and streaked by swabs manually or with
the RETRO C80 inoculator. ETEST strips can be applied onto inoculated media using
forceps, the NEMA C88 vacuum pen or the automatic Applicator SIMPLEX C76
The ETEST studies for Sulbactam-Durlobactam used manual inoculation with swabs and
applied ETEST strips with forceps at all test sites. The following statement is included as a
footnote to the performance table in the device labeling:
In the ETEST® Sulbactam/Durlobactam clinical studies, swabs were used for plate
inoculation/streaking and forceps were used for ETEST® strip application. Testing with
the optional Inoculator RETRO C80™, Vacuum Pen NEMA C88™, and Applicator
SIMPLEX C76™ was not evaluated during the clinical studies.
MIC Trending Analysis
Using the combined clinical and challenge data, an analysis of trending was conducted for
Acinetobacter-baumannii calcoaceticus complex. Results are stratified by species to
determine if species-related trends were observed (Table 4). This trending calculation
considers MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or
higher compared to the reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values are
on-scale or not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution
higher or in exact agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the
trending analysis.
Species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs. lower
readings was ≥ 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined to be statistically
significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that provides higher or
lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in labeling.
No significant trending was observed for Acinetobacter-baumannii calcoaceticus complex
overall or for each individual species with ETEST Sulbactam-Durlobactam when compared
to the reference method (Table 4).

The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a breakpoint change protocol that was
reviewed and accepted by FDA. This protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in
response to breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The protocol outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that bioMérieux
intends to use to evaluate the bioMérieux ETEST Sulbactam/Durlobactam (SUD) (0.004/4-64/4
µg/mL) when revised breakpoints for Sulbactam/Durlobactam are published on the FDA STIC
webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the submission indicated that if specific
criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the ETEST Sulbactam/Durlobactam device label to
include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-evaluation of data in
this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined
by their evaluation.
