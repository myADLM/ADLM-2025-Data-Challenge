B Principle of Operation:
The CHOLESTEROL test system uses the cholesterol oxidase peroxidase (CHOD-PAP)
enzymatic colorimetric method. The cholesteryl esterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of cholesterol
esters to cholesterol and free fatty acids. Free cholesterol, including that originally present in the
sample, is then oxidized by the enzyme cholesterol oxidase to cholest-4-en-3-one, by using
molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor and concurrently producing hydrogen peroxide
(H O ). The H O produced is then used in a subsequent chromogenic oxidative coupling
2 2 2 2
reaction, catalyzed by the enzyme peroxidase, in the presence of a redox indicator system, which
leads to the formation of a colored compound, absorbing light at 550 nm. The increase in
absorbance is directly proportional to the cholesterol concentration in the sample.
The HDL-Cholesterol test system uses the Accelerator Selective Detergent method. The
determination of HDL-Cholesterol is based on the following reactions: LDL, VLDL, and
chylomicrons are neutralized by the combined action of the enzymes Cholesterol Oxidase,
Peroxidase, accelerators and DSBmT. HDL remaining in the sample is disrupted by the action of
K232404 - Page 3 of 15

--- Page 4 ---
a selective detergent and cholesterol is converted to Δ4 Cholestenone by the enzymatic action of
Cholesterol Esterase and Cholesterol Oxidase, with the subsequent production of H O , which
2 2
reacts with DSBmT and 4-aminoantipyrine in the presence of Peroxidase to a colored complex
that absorbs light at 590 nm. The absorbance measured is proportional to the concentration of
HDL-Cholesterol in the sample.
The LDL-Cholesterol test system uses the Selective Detergent method. The method is in a two-
reagent format and depends on the properties of a unique detergent. The first detergent
solubilizes only the non-LDL lipoprotein particles. The cholesterol released is consumed by
cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase in a non-color forming reaction. The second
detergent solubilizes the remaining LDL particles, and a chromogenic coupler allows for color
formation. The enzyme reaction with LDL-C in the presence of the coupler at 590 nm produces
color that is proportional to the amount of LDL cholesterol present in the sample.
The TRIGLYCERIDES test system uses the enzymatic glycerol-3-phosphate-peroxidase (GPO-
POD) method. The method enzymatically hydrolyzes by lipase to free fatty acids and glycerol.
Glycerol is phosphorylated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with glycerol kinase (GK) to
produce glycerol-3- phosphate and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Glycerol-3-phosphate-oxidase
(GPO) oxidizes glycerol-3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and H O . The catalytic
2 2
action of peroxidase (POD) forms quinoneimine from H O , aminoantipyrine and TOOS. The
2 2
absorption change at 550 nm is proportional to the concentration of triglycerides in the sample.

target values to determine the deviation from linearity. For all samples, the deviation from
linearity was less than 7%. The linear regression results are given in the table below for a
single new lot:

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
An interference study for each candidate assay was evaluated following the
recommendations in the CLSI EP07 3rd Ed. guideline. Serum samples at two analyte
concentrations near the medical decision concentrations were evaluated for each substance.
The samples were divided into two aliquots: control with no added interferent and test with
added interferent. Each sample was measured in two replicates. The study tested for possible
interference from common endogenous substances, and exogenous substances such as
medications or supplements likely to be used by the target patient population. The following
tables list the concentration of each substance at which no significant interference was
detected; defined as a difference of less than or equal ±10% between the test sample and
control.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable ranges for each analyte are given in the table below:
Analyte Reportable Range (mg/dL)
Cholesterol 25 to 700
HDL-Cholesterol 6 to 180
LDL-Cholesterol 3 to 800
Triglycerides 10 to 1000
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The candidate assays and their respective calibrators are traceable to NIST standard reference
materials (SRM 1952a, SRM 1951c and SRM 909c).
On-Board Stability
The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and determined to be adequate.
All reagents demonstrated on-board stability of 28 days.
6. Detection Limit:
Protocols for the determination of the limit of blank (LoB), the limit of detection (LoD) and
the limit of quantification (LoQ) were performed in accordance with the recommendations in
the CLSI Guideline EP17-A2. The LoB and LoD studies were carried out using blanks and
low-level samples (60 each) over 3 days. The LoQ study used 10 serum samples that spanned
the low end of linearity that were measured 5 times per day over 3 days for a total of 150
measurements per sample. The studies were performed on one Diatron Pictus 500 Clinical
Chemistry Analyzer.
The resulting LoB, LoD and LoQ for the four measurands are summarized below:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
To establish the accuracy of the Medicon Hellas assays, a method comparison study was
conducted to evaluate the analytical agreement to a comparator method for each of the 4
analytes. Serum samples were tested in singlicate on the Diatron PICTUS 500 Analyzer and
the comparators. The results of the method comparison studies are summarized as follows:
Regression Analysis
Analyte N Slope Intercept R2 Range (mg/dL)
Cholesterol 93 0.9769 5.098 0.999 44 to 666
HDL-Cholesterol 141 1.018 -0.028 0.997 6 to 177
LDL-Cholesterol 107 0.9821 1.750 0.999 5 to 721
Triglycerides 163 0.999 2.041 0.999 26 to 975
Predicted Bias at Medical Decision Points
An estimate of the predicated bias at the medical decision points was calculated as the
percent difference between the regression line and the unity line at each medical decision
point.
