A Purpose for Submission:
This traditional 510(k) submission for the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B
CLIA-Waived Kit was submitted by BD to obtain clearance (SE) for the device after making
hardware modifications to the analyzer with associated updates to the instrument software
(firmware).
There were no changes to the kit, reagents, procedure to perform the test and therefore no new
analytical and clinical data were required with these revisions. The intended use of the device

III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B CLIA-Waived Kit is a rapid
chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral
nucleoprotein antigens from nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs of symptomatic patients. The BD
Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B CLIA-Waived Kit (also referred to as the BD
Veritor System and BD Veritor System Flu A+B) is a differentiated test, such that influenza A
viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a single processed
sample using a single device. The test is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and
B viral infections. A negative test is presumptive, and it is recommended that these results be
confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay. Negative test
results do not preclude influenza viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for
treatment or other patient management decisions. The test is not intended to detect influenza C
antigens.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B were established during January through
March of 2011 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and
B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant influenza viruses in circulation according to the
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC entitled “Update: Influenza Activity—
United States, 2010–2011 Season, and Composition of the 2011–2012 Influenza Vaccine.”
Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza viruses.
If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should
be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses
and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Virus culture should not be attempted
in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B CLIA-Waived Kit is intended for use with
the BD Veritor Plus Analyzer.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B CLIA-Waived Kit is a rapid
chromatographic immunoassay for the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral
antigens from nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs of symptomatic patients. The test is to be used as
an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. It is a differentiated test, such that
influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B viral antigens from a single
processed sample using a single test device.
When specimens are processed and added to the assay test device, any influenza A or B antigens
present in the specimen bind to anti-influenza antibodies conjugated to colloidal gold micro-
particles on the Veritor Flu A+B test strip. The antigen-conjugate complexes migrate across the
test strip to the capture zone and reacts with either Anti-Flu A or Anti-Flu B antibodies that are
immobilized on the two test lines on the membrane. The BD Veritor test devices are designed
with five spatially distinct reaction zones including:
− a separate test line position for each target analyte (Flu A and Flu B),
− positive and negative control line positions, and
− a background zone
The test lines for the target analytes are labeled on the test device as ‘A’ for flu A position, and
‘B’ for flu B position. The onboard positive control ensures the sample has flowed correctly and
is indicated on the test device as ‘C’. Two of the five distinct zones on the test device are not
labeled. These two zones are an onboard negative control line and an assay background zone.
The active negative control feature in each test identifies and compensates for specimen-related,
nonspecific signal generation. The remaining zone is used to measure the assay background.
The BD Veritor System consists of a dedicated opto-electronic interpretation instrument and
immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative detection of antigens from pathogenic
organisms in samples processed from respiratory specimens. The assay included in this
application is intended for interpretation in both laboratory and near-patient testing environments
only with the BD Veritor Plus Analyzer Instrument (“the Analyzer”) and is not interpreted
visually.
The Analyzer is a portable, electronic instrument that uses a reflectance-based measurement
method to evaluate line signal intensities on the assay test device. It applies assay-specific
firmware algorithms to determine the presence or absence of target analyte(s). The Analyzer is
powered by a rechargeable Li-ion battery and compact wall transformer, is intended for tabletop
or benchtop use, and follows the original BD Veritor instrument model of a calibration-free
K232434 - Page 3 of 10

--- Page 4 ---
limited lifetime based on the number of tests performed, the number of days from first use,
and/or the maximum shelf life from the date of manufacture. By design, the Analyzer has few
external means for user input or output. Operation requires minimal operator interaction to
complete testing and to report results. Analyzer workflow procedures depend on the instrument
configuration selected by the user. In Analyze Now mode, the instrument evaluates assay test
devices after manual timing of their incubation. In Walk Away mode, test devices are inserted
immediately after application of the specimen, and timing of assay incubation and analysis is
automated. In either case, assay results are provided to the operator on the liquid crystal display
(LCD) display screen. Additional result documentation capabilities are possible with the use of a
BD Veritor bar code scanning module, which can capture, display and/or integrate barcoded
specimen, operator or kit information in the test record.
This 510(k) application includes validation of the changes made to the analyzer to add a plastic
shield to the Analyzer’s enclosure and in front of the LCD screen to protect the screen from
being damaged when a high electrostatic discharge (ESD) voltage is applied. The main printed
circuit board assembly (PCBA) was modified to add enhanced ESD and battery protection. A
new firmware (V6.00) was developed to support the analyzer’s new hardware features.
B Principle of Operation:
Immunochromatographic separation of influenza A or B antigen-antibody complexes detected
via opto-electronic reader.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
BD Veritor Plus Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimens ID’s may be manually entered or scanned via the barcode scanner.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Swab samples from nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs are manually transferred to test kit reagent
tubes for elution and drop-wise addition to the test cassette. Freshly collected samples should be
processed within 1 hour.
4. Calibration:
Not Applicable
5. Quality Control:
The test includes a positive control to ensure adequate migration of the reagents through the
test membrane to the desired test line locations for the reader. The test also contains a
negative control to test for non-specific binding and two background test regions to measure
K232434 - Page 4 of 10

--- Page 5 ---
assay background when calculating test line signal strength. Each kit also contains positive
control swabs for Influenza A and Influenza B. It is the manufacturer’s recommendation that
positive controls be run after every new kit lot, a new operator performs the test, a new
shipment of test kits is received, and as required by local, state, and federal regulations.
