B Indication(s) for Use:
The ALB Luz Viral Transport Media is intended for the collection and transport of upper
respiratory clinical specimens containing Influenza A, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus
(RSV), and Rhinovirus from the collection site to the testing laboratory. The Viral Transport
Media is a culture-based media that is intended to be used with standard diagnostic/identification
techniques that utilize stable recoverable infectious viral particles.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The Viral Transport Media is intended to be used with Rayon Tip Swab listed on FDA by the
manufacturer HENSO MEDICAL (HANGZHOU) CO., LTD. The use of medium, tubes, or
swabs from any other source may compromise performance.
Condition, timing, and volume of specimen collected for culture are significant variables in
obtaining reliable culture results.
The Viral Transport Medium is not intended for freezing and thawing.
The medium has been evaluated for its ability to transport various respiratory viruses, which
include, Influenza A, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Rhinovirus, for viral recovery.
Results obtained largely depend on proper and adequate specimen collection as well as the
promptness with which the specimens are transported to the laboratory and analyzed.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Viral Transport Medium (VTM) is a non-propagating transport device composed of a
culture-based media without swabs. The VTM is designed to preserves upper respiratory samples
collected from a patient by placing the sample into the polymer tube containing 3 mL of media.
The sample and media are then secured with a leak-proof screwcap for transportation.
The VTM maintains cellular integrity and preservation of viruses when properly stored. Prior to
use, vials should be stored at 2°C to 35°C. After specimen collection, the transport tube
containing the specimen can be stored for up to 48 hours at either 2-8°C or 20-25°C, for
transportation to the laboratory and storage. The medium has been evaluated for storage of the
following respiratory viruses, Influenza A, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Rhinovirus,
for viral recovery.
B Principle of Operation:
The Viral Transport Media - VTM has a formulation that preserves viral viability. The VTM
contains the following ingredients.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
A. Shelf-Life:
The shelf-life for the ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media was established to be 18 months from
the date of manufacture when stored in a clean, dry, ventilated environment at 2 - 35°C. The
shelf-life study was conducted by using real-time aging performance test for 18 months. In
this study, the shelf life was evaluated for physical stability of appearance and volume, and
pH stability during the period of storage.
i. Physical Stability: To evaluate physical stability, any changes in appearance in color,
turbidity and volume of the ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media were physically or
visually examined at storage time points T = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months. Three lots
were tested for physical stability at storage conditions of 2°C and 35°C. At each time
point, appearance of the product was inspected visually which appeared clear with slight
precipitation and maintained an orange-pink color (i.e., no changes in color) and no
changes in liquid media volume. All results were acceptable and support the claim that
the ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media is physically or visually stable for 18 months.
ii. pH Stability: To evaluate product stability, the pH of the ALB LUZ Viral Transport
Media was tested at storage time points T = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months. Three lots
were tested for pH stability at storage condition of 2°C and 35°C. At each time point, the
pH was measured by immersing the pH meter electrode into each ALB LUZ Viral
Transport Media by adjusting the temperature to 25°C. For all the tubes tested, the pH
measurement was within the acceptable pH range of 7.2 to 7.6. All results were
acceptable and support the claim for pH stability of the ALB LUZ Viral Transport
Media for 18 months.
The results for physical stability and pH stability collectively support the 18-month stability
claim for the ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media.
B. Sterilization:
The ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media is not claimed to be sterile nor is it intended to be
sterilized by the end user. To reduce the contamination, the transport media is filtered using a
0.22 µm sterile filter membrane and then 3 mL aliquot is aseptically transferred into
individual sterile conical screw-capped tubes. A microbial contamination check was
conducted by incubating the tubes for 48 hours at 35°C ± 2°C followed by transferring 100
K232454 - Page 5 of 8

--- Page 6 ---
μL of transport media into BHI media and incubating for 24 hours at 35°C ± 2°C. No growth
was observed on any of the tested media.
6. Detection Limit:
Performance Testing – Viral Recovery Studies:
Performance of ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media was evaluated by Culture-Based Recovery
Studies for viral test strains using plaque forming assay. The viral strains and cell lines used for
the plaque forming assay are shown in the Table 1.
Table 1. Viral strains and Cell Lines used for the plaque forming assay.
Virus Strains Cell Lines
Influenza A virus H1N1 (ATCC VR-1520) MDCK (ATCC CCL-34)
Human respiratory syncytial virus (ATCC MRC-5 (Instituto Adolfo Lutz CCIAL 023)
VR-1540)
Human rhinovirus (ATCC VR-1178) MRC-5 (Instituto Adolfo Lutz CCIAL 023)
To perform the recovery assay, virus stock was 10-fold serially diluted into pooled negative
clinical nasal matrix. Each sample dilution was transferred into ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media
by using Rayon Tip Swab and stored at 2-8ºC and 20-25ºC for 0, 24 and 48 hours respectively.
Three lots of VTM with newly manufactured, mid-range lot and close to expiry lots were used to
evaluate viral recovery. For tissue culture, MDCK (ATCC CCL-34) and MRC-5 (Instituto
Adolfo Lutz CCIAL 023) were seeded in 24-well plates and grown to a confluent monolayer. To
perform the plaque forming assay, the viral samples from ALB LUZ Viral Transport Media were
serially diluted 10-fold and added to the monolayer in triplicate and allowed for virus adsorption
by incubating the plates for 1 hour at 37°C. Semisolid medium containing DMEM, 1%
carboxymethyl cellulose, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics were added to each well and
incubated at 37°C for 5-7 days. For counting the plaques developed, the cell fixation was
performed with 10% paraformaldehyde and the staining of cell monolayer was performed with
1% crystal violet. Plaque-forming units were counted visually. The viral titer of each sample was
recorded and calculated in plaque-forming units per mL (PFU/mL) and the results from the
triplicates were provided as an average PFU/mL for 0, 24 and 48 hours. Results were considered
acceptable if the average viral recovery demonstrates any percent changes within ±90% (i.e.,1
log change).
The results are presented in the Table 2 and Table 3 below. Any reduction in the viral count in
the timepoints was shown as percent changes and -ve indicates reduction.
