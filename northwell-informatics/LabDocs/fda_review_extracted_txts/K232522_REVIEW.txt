A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
ARK Levetiracetam II Assay: The ARK Levetiracetam II Assay is a homogeneous enzyme
immunoassay intended for the quantitative determination of levetiracetam in human serum or
plasma on automated clinical chemistry analyzers. Levetiracetam concentrations can be used as
an aid in management of patients treated with levetiracetam.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The assay has been validated on the Beckman Coulter AU680.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ARK Levetiracetam II Assay consists of reagents R1 anti-levetiracetam monoclonal
antibody with substrate and R2 levetiracetam labeled with bacterial G6PDH enzyme.
B Principle of Operation:
The ARK Levetiracetam II Assay is a homogeneous immunoassay based on competition
between drug in the specimen and levetiracetam labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for binding to the antibody reagent. As the latter binds antibody,
enzyme activity decreases. In the presence of drug from the specimen, enzyme activity increases
and is directly related to the drug concentration. Active enzyme converts the coenzyme
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH that is measured spectrophotometrically as
a rate of change in absorbance. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere with the results
because the coenzyme NAD functions only with the bacterial enzyme used in the assay.

Precision studies were performed based upon recommendations in the CLSI EP05-A3
guideline. Tri-level controls and three samples of levetiracetam in three pooled human serum
samples were used in the study. Data were collected on a single analyzer over twenty (20)
non-consecutive days. Each level was assayed in quadruplicate twice a day. Each of the runs
per day was separated by at least two hours. The within run, between day, and total
imprecision estimates were calculated. Results are shown below.

2. Linearity:
Linearity studies were performed based upon recommendations in CLSI EP06-Ed2. Ten (10)
levels of samples ranging from 2 to 100 μg/mL were prepared from a gravimetrically
prepared levetiracetam stock solution and levetiracetam-free serum pools. The averaged
results of multiple runs and replicates (n=6) for each sample using the ARK Levetiracetam II
Assay were used in the calculations. Regression analyses were performed between the
measured mean levetiracetam and the nominal values for each dilution, using weighted linear
regression analysis according to CLSI/NCCLS EP6-Ed2 and results are shown below. The
regression equation calculated according to EP06-Ed2 is y=1.003x.

Analytical recovery:
Serum samples across the assay range were prepared containing levetiracetam (sourced from
USP). The results of the six replicates were averaged and compared to the theoretical target
concentration and the percentage recovery was calculated. Results are shown below.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were carried out based upon recommendations in CLSI EP7-A3.
Interference was tested using serum pools at two levels of levetiracetam, 15 and 50 μg/mL.
Each sample was assayed using the ARK Levetiracetam II Assay, along with a serum control
of levetiracetam. Bias exceeding 10% is considered significant interference. The highest
concentration of interferent tested that did not cause significant interference is summarized in
the table below.

Drug interference:
Brivaracetam (Briviact) interferes with measurements of levetiracetam (Keppra) in the
ARK Levetiracetam II Assay. Patients undergoing a switch in drug therapy involving
Keppra and Briviact should not be monitored for levetiracetam using the ARK assay if
there is a possibility these drugs are co-present in circulation.
The device was not impacted by other structurally unrelated drugs tested. A high
concentration of each compound was spiked into normal human serum with known levels of
levetiracetam (approximately 15 and 50 μg/mL) and assayed along with a
serum control of levetiracetam. Measurement of levetiracetam resulted in ≤10% error in the
presence of drug compounds at the levels tested.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
D Clinical Cut-Off:
See expected values.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The following statement is included in the package insert:
A reference range for levetiracetam has not been well established. Reference ranges for seizure
control have been proposed, which include serum/plasma trough concentrations from 6 to 46
μg/mL (35 to 270 μmol/L) or 10 to 40 μg/mL (59 to 235 μmol/L) including a laboratory alert
level at 50 μg/mL (294 μmol/L). However, these ranges have not been validated by adequate
controlled trials, and in general the relationship between these serum concentrations and clinical
effect has not been well-defined. Levetiracetam drug concentrations should be used in
conjunction with information available from clinical evaluations and other diagnostic
procedures. Circulating levels of levetiracetam (serum blood concentrations) may be affected by
compliance, renal function, pregnancy, drug-drug interactions and timing of the sample draw.
Furthermore, the clinical effect of these serum blood concentrations may be further altered by
changes in progression in the severity of the disease and the addition or withdrawal of
concomitant drugs which may interact pharmacodynamically with circulating levels of
levetiracetam.
The reference range of drug concentrations which is quoted should only imply a lower limit
below which a therapeutic response is relatively unlikely to occur, and an upper limit above
which toxicity is relatively likely to occur in the specific patient populations studied. Generally,
clinicians using reference ranges such as these should be aware that, because of individual
variation, patients may achieve therapeutic benefit with serum drug concentrations outside of
these ranges and may experience toxicity with levels below the lower limit of the reference
range. Sampling time should be standardized such that trough serum concentrations are
measured just before the next dosage, preferably in the morning.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling support the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
