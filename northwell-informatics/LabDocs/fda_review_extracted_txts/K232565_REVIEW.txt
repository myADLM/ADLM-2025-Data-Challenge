B Indication(s) for Use:
Copan UriSponge - Urine Collection, Transport, and Preservation System, intended for the
collection, transport and preservation of urine specimens from the collection site to the testing
laboratory. In the laboratory, UriSponge specimens are processed using standard clinical
laboratory operating procedures for the cultivation of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Copan’s UriSponge - Urine Collection, Transport, and Preservation System consists of screw cap
self-standing plastic tube with conical shaped bottom. Inside the tube, the cap holds a plastic
stick with sponges made of hydrophilic polyurethane. The sponges include preservative
substances (Sodium Propionate, and Potassium Sorbate). Two sizes of product are available: the
regular tube size (100 mm length x 16 mm diameter) plastic tube, and the mini tube size (80 mm
length x 12 mm diameter) plastic tube.
B Principle of Operation:
The UriSponge applicator stick has two (mini size) or three (regular size) cylindrical shaped
sponges which are contained within appropriately sized sterile plastic tube with screw cap. The
sponges contain the chemical preservatives (Sodium Propionate, and Potassium Sorbate). These
chemical preservatives maintain the microbial load of bacteria and yeast in absorbed urine
sample during the transport until they are received and tested in the laboratory by standard
culture techniques.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Shelf Life: A real-time shelf-life stability testing was conducted. Testing was conducted with
3 different lots of the mini version of the devices (80 mm length x 12 mm diameter) at each
timepoint (at within 1 month after manufacture, at approximately 5-6 months after
manufacture, at approximately 12 months after manufacture and at 13 months after
manufacture). Physical, mechanical stability as well as sponge absorption and release
volumes were evaluated using 30 devices from each lot. To determine the physical and the
mechanical stability, each lot was inspected for device’s appearance and integrity through the
intended use workflow. Sponge absorption and release volume were also tested to determine
physical stability. Preservative content of UriSponge was tested at each timepoint by high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. All results met the study acceptance
criteria to support a shelf-life stability of 12 months when stored at 2-25°C in appropriate
storage environment.
Sterilization: UriSponge tubes are sterilized using irradiation, with the dosage set following
ISO 11137-1:2006 (including Amendment 1:2013 and Amendment 2:2019), Sterilization of
Health Care Products- Radiation-Part1: Requirements for development, validation, and routine
control of a sterilization process for medical devices. The acceptable sterility assurance level
(SAL) for the sterilized UriSponge product was determined to be 10-6 or greater.
6. Detection Limit:
Performance Testing - Recovery Studies:
A culture-based recovery study was performed to support that ability of the UriSponge
device to keep microbial load stable in the collected urine up to 48 hours at both 2-8 °C and
19-25 °C. Recovery of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC
13813), Enterococcus Faecalis (ATCC 29212), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853),
Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 7002), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (ATCC 15305), Enterobacter
Clocae (ATCC 13047), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883) and Candida albicans (ATCC
24433) were tested as representative strains for urine specimen. Pooled human negative
clinical urine samples were used as the best representative of the intended use sample type
for transport and downstream analysis. In brief, the samples were prepared by suspending
each of above-indicated freshly cultured organisms into human negative clinical urine. A
minimum of three different dilutions of stock culture were used to obtain a colony count of
25-250 per plate and the appropriate dilution factor was considered in determining the viable
count in CFU/mL. Sponge applicator of UriSponge devices of three lots (new, middle aged,
and recently expired) were immersed into contrived urine sample for 5 seconds and returned
to UriSponge tube and incubated for 0 hrs. (less than 20-minutes), 24 hrs., and 48 hrs. at 2-8
°C and 19-25°C. At the end of each incubation period, the devices were centrifuged, and the

absorbed sample were released, and aliquots of sample were spread onto appropriate agar
plates and incubated in appropriate environment for 24-48 hours. Following incubation,
colony forming units (CFU) were counted. A colony count of 25-250 per plate for at least
one dilution and the ΔLog ≤1 and ≥ -1 between the average CFU/plate values at time zero

(T = 0 hrs.) and at specific specimen incubation time (e.g., 24 hrs., 48 hrs., etc.) were
considered acceptable to support a specimen stability claim for each target organism.

or at 19-25°C.
Fill Volume Flex Study: Impact of undersaturation of UriSponge Device:
The applicator sponge in the Urisponge device contains preservative to stabilize the urine
sample. In situations when the applicator sponge is not fully saturated with the absorbed
urine due to sponge undersaturation, the concentrated preservative may result in the creation

of a toxic environment to the intended use organisms present in the urine sample. To
determine the impact of sponge undersaturation on microbial recovery, a fill volume flex
study was conducted with 3 newly manufactured lots and with three strains (E. coli ATCC
25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and S. agalactiae ATCC 13813) that exhibited the
highest log reduction at 72 hours incubation. First, a preliminary fill volume study was
conducted by immersing the applicator sponge in urine sample at different depths and for
different durations of time. Based on the minimum acceptable release volume (≥ 200 µl), the
worst-case scenario for undersaturation was determined. Finally, a comparative microbial
recovery evaluation (as described above) was conducted between the intended use workflow
and the worst-case scenario. For both scenarios, a colony count of 25-250 per plate for at
least one dilution and the ΔLog ≤1 and ≥ -1 between the average CFU/plate values between
10
time zero (T = 0 hrs.) and at the end of final incubation time, were considered acceptable to
support specimen stability. The study results for both the intended use workflow and the
worst-case scenario met the study acceptance criteria. The results from the fill volume flex
study thus indicate that there is no significant risk of toxicity to the intended use organism in
the urine sample due to undersaturation of UriSponge device.
