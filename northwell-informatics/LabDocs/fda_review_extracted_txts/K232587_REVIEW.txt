See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The MAGLUMI X3 Fully-auto chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer is an automated,
immunoassay analyzer designed to perform in vitro diagnostic tests on clinical specimens.
The MAGLUMI 25-OH Vitamin D is an in vitro chemiluminescence immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of 25-OH Vitamin D (25-OH VD) in human serum and plasma using
the MAGLUMI series Fully-auto chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer, and the assay is
used for an aid in assessment of vitamin D sufficiency.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Not for Point of care (POC) testing
D Special Instrument Requirements:
MAGLUMI X3 Fully-auto chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
MAGLUMI X3 Fully-auto chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer:
The MAGLUMI X3 Fully-auto chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer is a fully automated
instrument system designed to perform in vitro diagnostic tests on clinical specimens. The system
utilizes chemiluminescent technology and uses pre-packaged reagent packs for quantitative
analysis of the analytes in human samples. The analyzer performs automatic sample pipetting,
reagent loading, incubation, washing, measurements, and result calculations.
MAGLUMI 25-OH Vitamin D assay:
The MAGLUMI 25-OH Vitamin D kit consists of the following reagents-
• Magnetic Microbeads- coated with anti-25-OH VD antibody in PBS buffer, NaN3
(<0.1%).
• Calibrator Low- A low concentration of 25-OH VD antigen in Carbonate buffer, NaN3
(<0.1%).
• Calibrator High- A high concentration of 25-OH VD antigen in Carbonate buffer, NaN3
(<0.1%).
• Buffer- Acidic buffer
• ABEI Label- ABEI labeled with anti-25-OH VD antibody (~0.500 μg/mL) in PBS buffer,
NaN3 (<0.1%).
• Control 1- A low concentration of 25-OH VD antigen in Carbonate buffer, NaN3 (<0.1%).
• Control 2- A high concentration of 25-OH VD antigen in Carbonate buffer, NaN3 (<0.1%).
B Principle of Operation:
The 25-OH Vitamin D assay is a sandwich chemiluminescence immunoassay for the quantitative
determination of total 25-OH vitamin D in human serum and plasma. The sample, magnetic
microbeads coated with anti-25-OH VD antibody, and buffer are mixed thoroughly, incubated and
a wash cycle is performed after a precipitation in a magnetic field. N-(4-Aminobutyl)-N-ethyl
isoluminol (ABEI)-labeled with another anti-25-OH VD antibody is then added, reacting to form
sandwich complexes and incubated. After precipitation in a magnetic field, the supernatant is
K232587 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
decanted, and then another wash cycle is performed. Subsequently, the starter 1+2 is added to
initiate a chemiluminescent reaction. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative
light units (RLUs), which are proportional to the concentration of 25-OH VD present in the sample.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name: MAGLUMI X3 Fully-auto chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
The specimen is in a tube with a barcode label. The system identifies the specimen by scanning
the barcode. This is the primary use case for sample identification. For samples that have no
barcode, the system also supports manual entry of sample IDs.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling and handling procedures are analyte specific and are documented in the
specific reagent Instructions for Use (IFU).
4. Calibration: Calibrators are prepared according to the reagent kit instructions. Calibration
recommendations are described in the labeling.
5. Quality Control: Recommendations relating to Quality Control procedures are described in the
labeling.

2. Linearity:
A low serum sample pool and a high serum sample pool were mixed in different proportions
to create eleven linearity samples with 25-OH vitamin D concentrations from 1.8 to 195
ng/mL. Each sample was measured in 4 replicates on 3 lots of reagent. Linearity was evaluated
using regression analysis.
Slope Intercept r2 Sample range tested
1.0016 0.4938 0.9974 1.8 to 195 ng/mL
The results of the linearity study support the claimed reportable range of 5.371-150 ng/mL.
Sample Dilution study
A sample dilution study was conducted to support the claim in the product labeling that 25-
OH vitamin D samples with results above the measuring range may be manually diluted with
a carbonate buffer, pH 9.2. In the study, five serum samples were spiked with 25-OH vitamin
D to prepare concentrations with expected values ranging from 150 - 300 ng/mL. Each of the
four samples were diluted 1:2. Each diluted sample was assayed in duplicate and analyzed for
recovery after correcting for dilution. The recoveries ranged from 97% to 99%. The dilution
study results support the sponsor’s labeling claims that samples with 25-OH vitamin D
concentrations above 150 ng/mL may be manually diluted 1:2 to obtain results up to 300
ng/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The effect of common drugs and interference substances were evaluated using human serum
pools. For each substance, three serum samples containing 10, 50 and 100 ng/mL of 25-OH
Vitamin D were analyzed. No significant interference was defined as recovery within ± 10%
when compared to the control sample. The substances and the highest concentration tested
which did not cause significant interference are listed below.

Cross-Reactivity Study:
A cross-reactivity study was performed using three base serum samples containing total 25-
OH Vitamin D at concentrations of 10 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, and 100 ng/mL. These samples were
spiked with various cross reactants and measured using 3 lots of reagents. The cross-reactivity
was determined using the following formula: % cross reactivity = [(mean recovery of test
samples in ng/mL) – (mean recovery of control sample in ng/mL) / (concentration of cross
reactant in ng/mL)] * 100.
The following table shows the cross-reactivity of potential cross reactant.

calculated using the mean of the 57th and 58th highest obtained values and was determined to
be 0.923 ng/mL (highest of the 3 lots).
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by testing four level of low serum samples in 5
replicates per day, over 3 days using 3 lots of reagents. The LoD was calculated using
parametric analysis. LOD was determined to be 1.398 ng/mL (highest of the 3 lots).
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined by measuring six low serum samples, in five
replicates per run, one run per day, over 3 days, using 3 lots of reagents. LoQ is defined as the
lowest analyte concentration that can be reproducibly measured with an intermediate precision
CV of ≤ 20 % and was determined to be 2.289 ng/mL (highest of the 3 lots).

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted to support the use of the MAGLUMI 25-OH
VITAMIN D on the MAGLUMI X3 instrument with different sample matrices. Specifically,
the study compared values obtained from samples drawn into serum and k2EDTA plasma
collection tubes. 78 serum/K2EDTA plasma pair samples, with 25-OH Vitamin D
concentrations ranging from 5.3 to 143 ng/mL, were collected from the same donor and tested.
The following results were determined using Passing-Bablok regression analysis: y=0.977x-
