New Device
B Measurand:
Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Cocaine, Morphine, Marijuana, and Phencyclidine
C Type of Test:
Qualitative lateral flow immunoassay
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The LYHER® Urine Multi-Drug Test Kit (Cup), LYHER® Urine Multi- Drug Test Kit
(Cassette), and LYHER® Urine Multi-Drug Test Kit (Dipcard) are rapid lateral flow
immunoassays for the qualitative detection of d-Amphetamine, d-Methamphetamine,
Benzoylecgonine, Morphine, Phencyclidine and THC-COOH in human urine. The test cut-off
concentrations and the compounds the tests are calibrated to are as follows:
Test Calibrator Cut-off (ng/mL)
Amphetamine (AMP) d-Amphetamine 1000
Cocaine (COC) Benzoylecgonine 300
Marijuana (THC) 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH 50
Methamphetamine (MET) d-Methamphetamine 1000
Opiates(OPI) Morphine 2000
Phencyclidine (PCP) Phencyclidine 25
The single or multi-test panels can consist of the above listed analytes in any combination, up to
a maximum of 6 analytes. The drug screen tests are intended for prescription use only. The tests
provide only a preliminary result. A more specific alternative chemical method should be used in
order to obtain a confirmed presumptive positive result. Gas Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry (GC/MS), Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) and their
tandem mass-spectrometer versions are the preferred confirmatory methods. Careful
consideration and judgment should be applied to any drugs of abuse screen test result,
particularly when evaluating preliminary positive results.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The LYHER® Urine Multi-Drug Test Kit(Cup), LYHER® Urine Multi-Drug Test Kit(Cassette),
LYHER® Urine Multi-Drug Test Kit(Dipcard) are immunochromatographic assays that use a
lateral flow system for the qualitative detection of d-Amphetamine, d-Methamphetamine,
Benzoylecgonine, Morphine, Phencyclidine and THC-COOH in human urine. The LYHER®
Urine Multi-Drug Test Kit (Cup) device consists of 25 or 40 cup devices and a package insert.
The LYHER® Urine Multi-Drug Test Kit (Dipcard) device consists of 10/15/20/25 Dip Card
devices, a package insert. The LYHER® Urine Multi-Drug Test Kit (Cassette) device consists of
10/15/20/25 cassette devices, 10/15/20/25 droppers, a package insert.
B Principle of Operation:
Each device employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology and is based
on the principle of competitive binding. The product contains membrane strips coated
with drug-protein conjugates on the T zone, goat anti-rabbit polycolonal antibody at
the C zone, and a conjugate pad which contains colloidal gold particles coated with
mouse monoclonal antibodies specific against to the corresponding drugs and
colloidal gold particles coated with rabbit IgG.
If the level of drug in the urine specimen is below the cutoff concentration, the T line
appears as a visible burgundy line. If the level of drug in the urine specimen is above
the cutoff, no T line develops. The control line (C line) serves as an internal quality
control. The control line should always appear as a burgundy-colored band regardless
of the presence of the drug, if enough sample volume has been added to the test and if
the sample has correctly migrated up the test strip.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cut off,
-75% cut off, -50% cut off, -25% cut off, +25% cut off, +50% cut off, +75% cut off and
+100% cut off. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in negative samples. Three
operators performed the study using three lots of each test format (dip card, test cup, and
cassette). Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC/MS. All sample aliquots were
blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples and didn’t take part in the sample
testing. Each concentration was tested using 3 lots, by 6 operators. Each specimen was
analyzed in 50 replicates by each of the testing personnel at three representative POC sites by
using three lots of the product separately.
The test results of the specimens at the concentrations at and below -25% of the cut off
obtained by all the three personnel were all negative while the test results of the specimens at

2. Linearity:
Not Applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interfering Substances:
Analytical specificity for each test format was determined by adding potential interfering
substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological conditions to drug-free
urine and target drugs urine with concentrations at 25% below and 25% above Cut-Off
levels. These urine samples were tested using three lots of each device configuration.
Compounds that showed no interference to the assays in this submission at a concentration of
100μg/mL are summarized in the following table. There were no differences observed for
each of the different devices (i.e. cassette, dipcard, and cup).

1.003 to 1.032 specific gravity or urine samples with pH 3 to 9 were spiked with target
drugs at 25% below and 25% above Cut-off levels. These samples were tested using three
lots of each configuration (cassette, dipcard, and cup). Results were all positive for
samples at and above +25% Cut-off and all negative for samples at and below -25%
Cut-Off. There were no differences observed for different devices.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not Applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The assay is traceable to a commercially-available, certified, standard material with the
concentration verified by GC-MS or LC-MS/MS.
6. Detection Limit:
Not Applicable.
7. Assay Cutoff:
For characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration, please refer to the Precision section VII.A.1., above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies for the LYHER® Urine Multi-Drug Test were performed with
three operators for each test configuration of the device (cassettes, dipcards, and cups).
Operators ran at least 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples for
each analyte. The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC/MS results. The results
are presented in the tables below:
