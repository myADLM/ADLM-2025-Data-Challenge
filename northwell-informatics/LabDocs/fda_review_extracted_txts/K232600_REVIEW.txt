DxFLEX Flow Cytometer
The DxFLEX Flow Cytometer is intended for use as an in vitro diagnostic device for
immunophenotyping using up to ten fluorescent detection channels using three lasers (488 nm,
638 nm, and 405 nm) and two light scatter detection channels. It is intended for use with in vitro
diagnostic (IVD) assays and software that are indicated for use with the instrument.
The ClearLLab 10C Panels
The ClearLLab 10C Panels are intended for in vitro diagnostic use for qualitative identification
of various cell populations by multiparameter immunophenotyping on the Navios, Navios EX
and DxFLEX flow cytometers. These reagents are used as an aid in the differential diagnosis of
hematologically abnormal patients having, or suspected of having, the following hematopoietic
neoplasms: chronic leukemia, acute leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma,
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and/or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The reagents
can be used with peripheral whole blood (collected in K2EDTA, Acid Citrate Dextrose (ACD) or
Heparin), bone marrow (collected in K2EDTA, ACD or Heparin) and lymph node specimens.
Interpretation of the results should be confirmed by a pathologist or equivalent professional in
conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings. These reagents provide multiparameter,
qualitative results for the surface antigens listed below:
• ClearLLab 10C B Cell Tube: Kappa, Lambda, CD10, CD5, CD200, CD34, CD38, CD20,
CD19, CD45

The DxFlex Flow cytometer is being cleared for use with the ClearLLab 10C Reagent
System which was cleared on the Navios EX Flow cytometer (K183592). The ClearLLab
10C Reagent System on the DxFLEX Flow Cytometer is comprised of the following:
• DxFLEX Flow Cytometer [3 laser/10 color configurations]
• DxFLEX Daily QC Fluorospheres
• ClearLLab 10C Panels [B, T, M1 and M2]
• ClearLLab Compensation Kit
• ClearLLab Compensation Beads
• ClearLLab Control Cells, normal and abnormal
• IOTest 3 Fixative Solution [Existing] • IOTest 3 Lysing Solution
• Kaluza C Software
The DxFLEX Flow Cytometer includes ten fluorescent detection channels (FL1-FL10) and
three laser configurations (blue, red and violet).
The ClearLLab 10C Reagent System on the DxFLEX Flow Cytometer includes the
CytExpert for DxFLEX Software (i.e., acquisition software) and the Kaluza C Analysis
Software (i.e., analysis software) (cleared in K183592 (version 1.1)).
As with the workflow on the predicate system (K183592), listmode (LMD) data analysis is
performed manually using the Kaluza C Analysis Software. This Analysis Software package
is supplied separately from the DxFLEX and is installed on an independent computer
workstation for off-line analysis of listmode files generated on the flow cytometer with the
associated reagents and cytometer system software package, including Control Cell Quality
Control (QC) data and sample data analysis. The CytExpert for DxFLEX software is used to
run the DxFLEX Daily QC Fluorospheres and Compensation products, Kaluza C Software is
a software tool designed to work with *.fcs and *.lmd files generated from flow cytometers.
Preset Kaluza C analysis templates for the ClearLLab 10C reagent system will be provided.
The total WBC gate is defined in the histogram of SS vs. CD45-KO525-A by the inclusion of
all CD45+ events with low, medium, and high Side Scatter after the exclusion of the cells
that were compromised and/or aggregated. A subsequent histogram defines specific
leukocyte subsets such as lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes. The low SS/bright CD45+
population identifies lymphocytes. Applicable markers are then displayed in subsequent
histograms gated on lymphocytes. This process is repeated for mid SS/medium CD45+
populations to identify monocytes and for high SS/medium CD45+ to identify granulocytes
As acquisition software, CytExpert.exe enables the user to acquire data from the DxFLEX
flow cytometer and allows the user to analyze, display, print and export acquired data.
The major features of the software are as follows:
• System Startup
• Instrument Quality Control and Standardization
• Data Acquisition
• Sample Analysis
• Compensation
• Data Review
• Report Generation
• Daily Clean
K232600 - Page 3 of 27

--- Page 4 ---
Kaluza C software is used for post-acquisition analysis and reporting.
2. Principles of Operation:
The DxFLEX flow cytometer aligns cells in suspension by hydrodynamic focusing and
passes them through a laser beam, one cell at a time. The scattered and fluoresced light that
emanates from these cells as they intersect the laser beam is collected by Avalanche
Photodiode detectors and transduced to an electronic pulse and counted by the instrument’s
computer. This test depends on the ability of a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody to bind to
the surface of cells expressing discrete antigenic determinants. Specific cell staining is
accomplished by incubating specimens prepared for staining with the appropriate antibody
reagent. After sample preparation, the specimens are acquired on the QC controlled flow
cytometer with manual gating.
B Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
DxFLEX Flow Cytometer
2. Specimen Identification:
Barcode reader or manual entry
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The automated sample loader for the instrument uses a carousel that holds thirty-two 12 x 75-
mm test tubes and includes a barcode reader.
4. Calibration:
Fluorescence intensity is calibrated and confirmed using the DxFLEX Daily QC
Fluorospheres with lot specific target values.
5. Quality Control:
The DxFLEX QC process verifies important system functions. The system verifies or
automatically adjusts the following parameters:
• Hardware configuration
• Laser power of each individual laser
• Laser delays parameters
• Gain settings
Beckman Coulter recommends performing QC on a daily basis.

instrument. It controls the instrument
functionality including the multi-
carousel loader (MCL) for sample
introduction.
The embedded software controls the
instruments’ lasers, acquisition
system and fluidics. The instrument
fluidics aspirates the sample and
performs instrument maintenance
functions such as startup/shutdown.
The embedded software also captures
and provides the data to the
workstation for processing.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted according to the methodology presented in CLSI EP12‐Ed3
and CLSI EP05-A3.
a. Precision (repeatability):
The repeatability of normal and abnormal clinical specimens representing clinical
matrices and anticoagulants was evaluated with the ClearLLab 10C Panels on the
DxFLEX Flow Cytometer at three sites. Sixty-four specimens across the three specimen
types, i.e., whole blood (WB), bone marrow (BM), and lymph node (LN), were
evaluated, with two excluded (due to specimen age and operator error). Each site
employed a different anticoagulant for specimens, according to their current clinical
practice: K2EDTA, acid citrate dextrose (ACD), or heparin.
Unless otherwise specified, a minimum of two specimens per specimen type per panel for
each anticoagulant (site) was included. For LN specimens, there was no minimum
requirement for the T panel (due to the low incidence of T lineage abnormalities), nor for
M1 and M2 (due to the development property of myeloid cells and the pathogenesis of
Myeloid abnormalities). Each specimen per panel was analyzed twice each day. There
were six sample preparations in the morning and six sample preparations in the afternoon,
resulting in a total of 12 replicates per specimen per panel. From 768 initial total
replicates, 24 were excluded for reasons of specimen quality or operator error. Both
quantitative and qualitative assessment were applied to the precision assessment where
the presence or absence of an abnormal phenotype was reported.

All results showed 100% qualitative agreement across all sites, panels, anticoagulants,
specimen types, and phenotypes.
For repeatability evaluation, pre-defined hematopoietic lineage populations were defined
as in the table below:

^ Samples is a phenotypically normal WB specimen collected in K2EDTA anticoagulant that demonstrated
%CV of 31.09% for between-runs and 32.24% for within-sample for CD33 marked Monocytes, as the CD33
marked Monocytes recovery in this specimen was 2.25% of total CD45+ cells. The data analysis indicated
that imprecision was likely due to variations from morning preparation to afternoon preparation within the
sample. The high imprecision for this sample has no clinical impact.

Sample is a phenotypically normal BM specimen collected in K2EDTA anticoagulant that demonstrated %CV
of 20.63% for the TCRg/d cells, as the TCR g/d cells recovery in this specimen was extremely low with only
an average of 73 events collected, representing only ~0.12% of total CD45+ cells. The high imprecision for
this sample has no clinical impact.
b. Operator-to-operator and instrument-to-instrument imprecision:
The imprecision of between-operator and between-instrument was evaluated by testing
four normal and four abnormal clinical specimens with the ClearLLab 10C Panels at one
site, with three operators analyzing three replicates on each of two DxFLEX instruments
on each of two runs. Each operator performed separate sample preparations in triplicate in
both the morning and afternoon. Samples were acquired on each of two instruments, the
order of which was randomized. Following acquisition, each operator analyzed listmode
datafiles (LMD), using Kaluza C software. A reviewer assessed each LMD analysis as
normal or abnormal, and further described the immunophenotype of abnormal results.
The study included 288 analyses (three operators/replicate x three replicates/run x two
runs/instrument x two instruments = 36 replicates/sample x eight samples).
All results showed 100% qualitative agreement across Instruments and Operators.
The number of samples tested is depicted in the tables below.

c. Site-to-Site Reproducibility with Control Material:
The reproducibility of the ClearLLab 10C Reagent System on DxFLEX Flow Cytometer
was evaluated utilizing one lot each of control cell materials: ClearLLab Normal Control
Cells and ClearLLab Abnormal Control Cells. These control materials express all surface
markers comprising the ClearLLab 10C panels. For multi-site testing, control materials
allow samples to be shared between sites in a manner not available for native samples.
For each panel, the two controls were tested on three instruments, across three total sites
using one ClearLLab 10C reagent lot. At Site 1, testing was performed for 20 days × two
runs/day × two replicates/run × three sites × one instrument/site. At sites 2 and 3, testing
was performed for five days × two runs/day × three replicates/run × three sites × one
instrument/site. Across all three sites, a total of 1133 analyses were generated; 13 were
excluded due to operator error. The results are summarized in the tables below.

are present), as well as the fluorescence intensity of the fluorochrome (quantum
efficiency) of the specific conjugate used for staining. These differences in cell number,
target analyte level, distribution on non-target populations and fluorochrome intensity
affect the ability of the instrument/cytometrist to distinguish specific populations. These
additional sources of variability contribute to the increased imprecision in several of the
phenotypes tested.

2. Linearity (Fluorescence Detection):
The study was performed to evaluate the linearity and dynamic range of the DxFLEX Flow
Cytometers’ acquisition systems, from the single-photon detection APD transfer to the
electronics, independent of the application and gating methodology using SpheroTECH
Rainbow particles (RCP-30-5A) analyzed at six different gain settings covering the dynamic
range of the DxFLEX Flow Cytometer. The study was conducted on three DxFLEX Flow
Cytometers. The results indicated the constancy (<5% deviation) of the ratio of adjacent bead
fluorescence, across a series of gain settings. Representative data from one DxFLEX Flow
Cytometer is presented in the following table.

and low concentration (low target value; LTv) were run in multiple replicates on the
DxFLEX Flow Cytometer. CD34 marker analysis was performed using a CD34+ clinical
specimen. Three high concentration samples (HTv1-HTv2-HTv3) targeting to 20,000
cells /μL white blood cells (WBC) were prepared from one specimen containing a high
level of white blood cells Low concentration samples (LTv1-LTv2-LTv3) counts were
prepared by staining a diluted (1:10,000) specimen with a blank Red Cell Pool (a red
blood cell pool which has been depleted of white blood cells diluted 4:1 with buffer).
This resulted in a specimen composition similar to whole blood regarding the red blood
cell concentration with residual concentrations of WBCs. On each of three DxFLEX
Flow Cytometers, three HTv samples (HTv1, HTv2, HTv3) were analyzed consecutively
followed immediately by the three LTv samples (LTv1, LTv2, LTv3) using the four
ClearLLab 10C Panels. A total of 54 specimen carryover runs were generated for each
panel. The % carryover, which is calculated as % Carryover = (LTV1-LTV3)/average
(HTv1, HTv2, HTv3), demonstrated to be < 1%, for each of the 37 phenotypes measured
across the four ClearLLab 10C tubes.
Reagent Carryover
Reagent carryover was evaluated by following the protocol from CLSI H26-A2 on three
DxFLEX Flow Cytometers. Samples with high concentration (high target value; HTv)
and low concentration (low target value; LTv) were run in multiple replicates on the
DxFLEX flow cytometer. Clinical bone marrow specimens stained with all four
ClearLLab 10C Panels were used as the high concentration samples. Low concentration
samples (LTv1, LTv2, LTv3) were prepared from the same clinical bone marrow
specimens as in the high concentration samples, that were processed in triplicate using
antibody dilution buffer (RD1), in place of the ClearLLab 10C Panels, to produce an
unstained sample. On each of three DxFLEX Flow Cytometers and three HTv samples
(HTv1, HTv2, HTv3) were analyzed consecutively followed immediately by the three
LTv samples (LTv1, LTv2, LTv3). A total of 54 specimen carryover runs were generated
for each panel. The % carryover, which is calculated as % Carryover = (LTV1-
LTV3)/average (HTv1, HTv2, HTv3), demonstrated to be < 1%, for each of the 37
phenotypes measured across the four ClearLLab 10C tubes.
4. Accuracy (Instrument):
Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed to demonstrate qualitative agreement for the
presence of abnormal cells between ClearLLab 10C Reagent System on the DxFLEX Flow
Cytometer vs Navios EX Flow Cytometer. The study was based on the data generated from a
multi-site retrospective clinical study conducted at five sites in which the test results from the
ClearLLab 10C Reagents used to detect the presence or absence of an abnormal phenotype
were compared to the clinical outcome of “malignant” or “non-malignant” based on the
clinical sites’ final patient diagnosis.
Testing was conducted on the DxFLEX and Navios EX flow cytometers utilizing de-
identified residual specimens, covering both hematologically abnormal malignant patients
and hematologically abnormal non-malignant patients in line with the intended use of the
ClearLLab 10C panels. The study included specimens of whole blood (WB) and bone

marrow (BM) collected in anticoagulant K2EDTA, Acid Citrate Dextrose (ACD) or Heparin,
as well as specimens of lymph node (LN), which overall reflect the three major specimen
types distributed in leukemia and lymphoma (L&L) diseases and clinical indications
encountered in the L&L population. Patients with abnormal B-cell, T-cell, Natural Killer
(NK) cell, and myeloid cell populations were tested. Specimen types tested reflected the
distribution of the diseases and/or clinical indications encountered in the population of
patients that are routinely encountered in evaluations of patients suspected of having
hematopoietic neoplasia by flow cytometry. The study design was purposive, and specimens
were enrolled consecutively.
Samples were prepared with all four ClearLLab 10C Panels, except LN where only B and T
tubes were required. The same prepared tube was randomized for acquisition once on the
Navios EX and once on the DxFLEX flow cytometer. Immunophenotyping was performed
with provided analysis protocols using Kaluza C software. The phenotype assessments of the
data generated from DxFLEX-10C system and Navios EX-10C system were independently
assessed from each other. If clinical diagnosis was provided in the subject’s case report form,
the Principal Investigator at each site was blinded to such diagnosis to further assure the
review was exclusively phenotype based. The assessment for presence or absence of an
abnormal phenotype was based on Bethesda and WHO guidelines as follows:
• A 3% (in total leukocytes) clinical cutoff will be applied to BM blast population
which is normally undetected in peripheral WB (<1%) or LN (<1%)
• 1% (in total leukocytes) clinical cutoff will be applied to all the other abnormal
populations detected in BM, WB, or LN specimens
Of the 550 samples enrolled, 38 were excluded due to failing the inclusion criteria,
preanalytical requirements or quality control or due to instrument, process or operator errors.
A total of 512 specimens were qualified and included in the final analysis for evaluating
method agreement per CLSI EP12-Ed3. The distribution of specimens is presented in the
following tables.

The clinical performance was also assessed with the predicate device. The results
demonstrated 100% phenotypic agreement between the candidate and predicate devices. For
both methods, when compared to clinical diagnostic outcome, there were a total of 107
discordant cases including 11 non-concordant to non-malignancy (false positive) and 96 non-
concordant to malignancy (false negative) cases. The false negative was categorized as being
due to specimen type limitation, flow cytometry limitation, or ClearLLab reagents limitation.
These limitations occur when the phenotypically abnormal population is not found in a
particular specimen, the clinical condition is not typically detected through flow cytometry,
or the reagents did not have all the antibodies required to detect a particular clinical
condition, respectively. False positive cases were primarily due to increases in populations
that could represent reactive responses to viral or bacterial infection or autoimmunity, where
lymphoid proliferation is common.
B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
The detection capability of the DxFLEX flow cytometer with the ClearLLab 10C Reagent, was
assessed for each reagent tube using one normal specimen (Blank) that was spiked with samples
having abnormal populations (CLL, T-ALL, Myelomonocytic Leukemia and AML), to target
0.5%, 1% and 2% of the abnormal population, each in five replicates. The results demonstrated
