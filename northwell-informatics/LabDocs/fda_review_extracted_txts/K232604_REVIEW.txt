A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The LYHER® Urine Marijuana (THC) Test Kit (Strip) and LYHER® Urine Marijuana (THC)
Test Kit (Cassette) are rapid lateral flow immunoassays for the qualitative detection of THC-
COOH in human urine. The test cut-off concentrations and the compounds the tests are
calibrated to are as follows:
Test Calibrator Cut-off (ng/mL)
Marijuana (THC) l1-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH 50
The drug screen tests are intended for prescription use only.
The tests provide only a preliminary result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be
used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical test result. Gas Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry (GC/MS), Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) and their tandem
mass-spectrometer versions are the preferred confirmatory methods. Careful consideration and
judgment should be applied to any drugs of abuse screen test result, particularly when evaluating
preliminary positive results.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The LYHER® Urine Marijuana (THC) Test Kit (Strip) and LYHER® Urine Marijuana (THC)
Test Kit (Cassette) are immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for the
qualitative detection of THC-COOH in human urine. The LYHER® Urine Marijuana (THC)
Test Kit (Cassette) device consists of a cassette device, dropper, and package insert. The
LYHER® Urine Marijuana (THC) Test Kit (Strip) device consists of a test strips and package
insert.
B Principle of Operation:
The Urine Marijuana (THC) Test Kit is an immunoassay based on the principle of competitive
binding. The metabolite of Marijuana (11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH) which may be present in the
K232604 - Page 2 of 8

--- Page 3 ---
urine specimen compete against its respective drug conjugate for binding sites on their specific
antibody.
During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. A drug, if present in the
urine specimen below its cut-off concentration, will not saturate the binding sites of its specific
antibody. The antibody will then react with the drug-protein conjugate and a visible colored line
will show up in the test line region of the specific drug strip. The presence of drug above the cut-
off concentration will saturate all the binding sites of the antibody. Therefore, the colored line
will not form in the test line region.
A drug-positive urine specimen will not generate a colored line in the specific test line region of
the strip because of drug competition, while a drug-negative urine specimen will generate a line
in the test line region because of the absence of drug competition.
To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control line region,
indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the product was characterized at three different labs using 3 operators for strips
or cassettes. The specimens were prepared for this study using drug-free urine specimens
collected from volunteers. 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH was added to the drug-free urine to the
following concentrations: 100 ng/ml (+100% cut off), 87.5 ng/ml (+75% cut off), 75 ng/ml
(+50% cut off), 62.5 ng/ml (+25% cut off), 50 ng/ml (cut off), 37.5 ng/ml (-25% cut off), 25
ng/ml (-50% cut off), 12.5 ng/ml (-75% cut off), 0 ng/ml (-100% cut off). Each specimen was
analyzed in 50 replicates (2 runs/day, 25 days) by each of the testing personnel at each lab by
using three lots of the product according to the product labeling. The test results of the
specimens at the concentrations at and below -25% of the cut off obtained by all the three
personnel were all negative while the test results of the specimens at the concentration at and
above +25% of the cut off value were all positive, see the representative results from one
operator with strips below.

11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH and structural analogues of 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH were spiked
into negative urine. These urine specimens were tested by three different batches of the strips
and cassettes according to the product labeling and each concentration of specimen was
tested for 20 replicates. The lowest concentration that caused a positive result for each
compound are listed below. There were no differences observed for stripes and cassettes.

b. Interferences
The potential interference from compounds chemically dissimilar to target analyte, and
known endogenous agents was also determined for the LYHER® Urine Marijuana (THC)
Test Kit (Strip) and LYHER® Urine Marijuana (THC) Test Kit (Cassette). The potential
interfering substances (the final concentration 100 μg/ml) were added at concentrations of
100 μg/ml to drug-free urine and target drugs urine with 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH
concentrations at 25% below (37.5 ng/ml) and 25% above (62.5 ng/ml) cut-off levels. These
urine samples were tested using three batches of each device. Compounds that showed no
interference at a concentration of 100 µg/mL are summarized in the following tables. There
were no differences observed for 3 different lots of devices (both strips and cassettes).

c. Urine pH and specific gravity
To evaluate the potential effect of variances of urine specific gravity on the assays, sodium
chloride was added to urine specimens containing target drugs at -/+25% of the cut off
concentrations to achieve specific gravity results of 1.003,1.006, 1.0125, 1.019, 1.021, 1.025
and 1.032. Each solution was tested on 3 lots of the stripes and cassettes. The specimens
were tested in 10 replicates.
To evaluate the potential effect of variances of urine pH on the assays, 0.1mol/L HCl or
0.1mol/l NaOH was added to urine specimens containing target drugs at -/+25% of the cut
off concentrations to achieve pH 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Each solution was tested on 3 lots of the
candidate product. The specimens were tested in 10 replicates.
The results demonstrated that pH levels of 3 to 9 and specific gravity levels of 1.006 to
1.032 do not affect any cassette and strip results.
