III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
CardioPhase hsCRP is an in-vitro diagnostic reagent for the quantitative determination of
C‑reactive protein (CRP) in human serum, and heparin and EDTA plasma by means of particle
enhanced immunonephelometry using the BN II and BN ProSpec System. In acute phase
response, increased levels of a number of plasma proteins, including C-reactive protein, is
observed. Measurement of CRP is useful for the detection and evaluation of infection, tissue
injury, inflammatory disorders and associated diseases. High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP)
measurements may be used as an independent risk marker for the identification of individuals at
risk for future cardiovascular disease. Measurements of hsCRP, when used in conjunction with
traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes, may be useful as an
independent marker of prognosis for recurrent events, in patients with stable coronary disease or
acute coronary syndromes.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
BN II System and BN ProSpec
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
CardioPhase hsCRP reagent is ready-to-use and consists of a suspension of polystyrene particles
coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies (< 0.016 g/L) specific to human CRP and preservatives.
Kit Contents:
• 5 x 5 mL CardioPhase hsCRP Reagent
-or-
• 3 x 2 mL CardioPhase hsCRP Reagent
Materials required but not provided:
• N Rheumatology Standard SL
• N/T Rheumatology Controls SL/1 and SL/2 and/or Apolipoprotein Control Serum CHD
• N Supplementary Reagent/Precipitation
• N Diluent
• BN II Evaporation Stoppers (optional)
• Additional materials and supplies as described in the BN System Instruction Manual

B Principle of Operation:
Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies specific to human CRP are aggregated
when mixed with samples containing CRP. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed
through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the
relevant protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known
concentration. Two measuring range settings are available: the conventional CRP1 workflow
(3.1 – 200 mg/L) and the high sensitivity CRP2 workflow (0.16 – 10 mg/L).

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed to evaluate the comparability between the
performance of the CRP1 method of the CardioPhase hsCRP on the BN II System and the
RCRP Flex assay on the Dimension clinical chemistry system following CLSI EP09c. A
cohort of 129 native serum samples was tested on one lot of the predicate and on three lots of
the CardioPhase using the CRP1 method. Samples falling outside the measuring range of
either assay were removed from the analysis and the results were determined by Passing-
Bablok regression analysis. For each lot, the predicted bias at CRP concentrations of 10
mg/L, 100 mg/L, 150, mg/L and 200 mg/L was ≤ ± 6%. The results of each lot are shown
below:
