It is intended for prescription use. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The test provides only preliminary results. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be applied to any drug of abuse test result，particularly in evaluating a preliminary
positive result.The tests provide only preliminary results. To obtain a confirmed analytical
result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. GC/MS or LC/MS is the
recommended confirmatory method.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Dochek® Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup Rx and Dochek® Multi-Drug Urine Test Cup are
immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for the qualitative detection of
single or multiple drugs in human urine.
The device is a cup format. The test strips are integrated into the cup provided and the urine
sample is collected directly into the cup containing the strips. Each cup device is sealed with two
sachets of desiccant in an aluminum pouch. The device is in a ready-to-use format.
B Principle of Operation:
The candidate device is a competitive immunoassay that is used to screen for the presence of
various drugs and drug metabolites in urine. It is a chromatographic absorbent device in which,
drugs within a urine sample, competitively combined to a limited number of drug monoclonal
antibody (mouse) conjugate binding sites. When the test is activated, the urine is absorbed into
each test strip by capillary action, mixes with the respective drug monoclonal antibody
conjugate, and flows across a pre-coated membrane. When drug within the urine sample is below
the detection level of the test, respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate binds to the
respective drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the test strip. This
produces a colored Test line in the Test Region (T) of the strip, which, regardless of its intensity,
indicates a negative test result.
When sample drug levels are at or above the detection level of the test, the free drug in the
sample binds to the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate, preventing the respective
drug monoclonal antibody conjugate from binding to the respective drug-protein conjugate
immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This prevents the development of a distinct
colored band in the test region, indicating a preliminary positive result.
To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C) of each
strip, if the test has been performed properly.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out in-house for samples with concentrations of +100% cutoff,
+75% cutoff, +50% cutoff, +25% cutoff, cutoff, -25% cutoff, -50% cutoff, -75% cut off and -
100% cutoff. These samples were prepared by spiked target drug in drug-free urine samples.
Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. For each concentration, tests were
performed two runs per day for 25 days using three lots of test cups with two configurations
by three operators. Configuration 1 included AMP1000, COC300, MET1000 and OPI2000.
Configuration s included AMP500, COC150, MET500 and MOP300. All sample aliquots
were tested in a blinded fashion. The results obtained are summarized in the following tables:

2. Linearity:
Not Applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-Reactivity:
To test cross-reactivity, drug metabolites and other structurally related compounds that
are likely to cross-react in urine samples were spiked into negative urine and were
tested using three lots of each device. The lowest concentration that caused a positive
result for each compound is listed below. If no cross reactivity was observed, the highest
concentration tested is shown.

Effect of Urinary Specific Gravity and pH:
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples, with specific
gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.035 or urine samples with pH ranging from 4 to 9 were
spiked with the target drugs to concentrations at 25% below and 25% above Cutoff levels.
These samples were tested using three lots with two configurations. The results demonstrated
that pH levels of 4 to 9 and specific gravity levels of 1.000 to 1.035 do not affect the results
of the assays.
4. Assay Reportable Range:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were performed in-house by three operators. Eighty (80)
unaltered clinical samples were run for each target drug. The samples were tested in a
blinded fashion and compared to LC/MS results. The results are presented in the tables
below:

2. Lay user study:
A lay user study was performed using two configurations of Dochek® Multi-Drug Urine
Test Cup at three intended use sites with 280 lay persons. The lay users had diverse ages and
educational and professional backgrounds. Urine samples were prepared at multiple
concentrations (Negative (-100%), +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff) by spiking drugs
into drug free pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by
LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and tested in a blinded
fashion. Each participant was provided with the package insert, one blind-labeled sample and
a test cup device, and was not provided any other assistance. Summary results are shown
below:
