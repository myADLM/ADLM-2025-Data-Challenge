The kit is compatible with stool specimens that are unpreserved or frozen or in transport media
including Cary Blair or C&S media from symptomatic patients with suspected gastroenteritis. It
is required that the stool is first processed using the EasyScreen Sample Processing Kit. Nucleic
acid extraction and real-time PCR set up are performed on the automated Genetic Signatures GS1
platform.
The EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit includes all reagents required to detect the
specific protozoan gene sequences using real-time PCR amplification of the extracted nucleic acids
and fluorogenic target-specific hybridization probes for the detection of the amplified nucleic acid.
The EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection kit also incorporates an Extraction Control
(EC) and an Internal Positive Control (IPC) to ensure the reliability of the extracted nucleic acid
and to detect the presence of any inhibitors, respectively.
This device is an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) intended to be used by trained personnel in clinical,
pathology or hospital laboratories as an aid in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal illness. This test is
intended for use, in conjunction with clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and
epidemiological information, as an aid in the differential diagnosis of infections by Dientamoeba
fragilis, Blastocystis hominis, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Entamoeba
histolytica, Encephalitozoon intestinalis, Cryptosporidium spp. (including C. hominis and C.
parvum), and Giardia intestinalis. Results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for
diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decision. Positive results do not rule out co-
infection with other organisms that are not detected by this test, and may not indicate the sole or
definitive cause of patient illness. Negative results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with
gastroenteritis and/or colitis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test
or non-infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Following limitations apply: (not an exhaustive list)
i. Whole blood at greater than 0.63% and Mucin at greater than 0.75 mg/mL demonstrated

vi. Performance of this assay has been validated only for the target organisms indicated in the
Intended Use statement. It has not been validated for any other non-target organisms. The
assay is qualitative and does not provide a quantitative value for target organisms present in
the stool specimens.
vii. During competitive interference testing, the detection of low positive D. fragilis and B.
hominis was attenuated by presence of high amounts of co-targets C. parvum and E.
histolytica, respectively. In regions of high prevalence or endemicity of Cryptosporidium spp
and Entamoeba histolytica, negative EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit
assay results should be interpreted cautiously. Perform additional tests if gastrointestinal
infections/co-infections by D. fragilis and B. hominis, respectively, are clinically suspected.

Additional components indicated as “Required but Not Supplied” are specified in the package
insert and include items and laboratory equipment for sample processing and PCR set up.
B Principle of Operation:
1. EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit is a multiplexed real time PCR assay,
designed to simultaneously detect and identify up to eight (8) potentially pathogenic
gastrointestinal parasites from human stool samples.
2. The device workflow is compatible with only nucleic acids prepared using the EasyScreen
Sample Processing kit (SP008B) in the GS1 automated nucleic acid extraction platform.
3. Kit SP008B contains Reagent 1 and 2 which are combined to make a “Conversion Reagent.”
Individual stool samples are mixed and heated with this conversion reagent which lyses
microbial cells and converts all Cytosine bases to Uracil (detected as Thymine) to create “3base
nucleic acids.”
4. Kit SP008B also contains Nucleic Acid extraction reagents, which are used on the stool lysate
for further processing to elute the nucleic acids on the GS1 automated platform. The purified
eluate proceeds to the PCR set-up step in the GS1 platform.
5. EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit (EP005 or EP005-HT) contains all the
reagents to be used for real-time PCR amplification and detection of the target gastrointestinal
parasites. These reagents are appropriately dispensed to uniquely designated sample wells in
the GS1 platform.
6. In the GS1 platform, aliquots of the purified nucleic acids eluted from the processed stool
sample are then added to EP005 PCR reagents in designated sample wells, which selectively
amplify the genetic targets of the target parasites. Each stool eluate is tested across three (3)
Reaction Mixes or Panels (i.e., Panel A, B, and C), each of which include an internal control.
Panel A and C detect an endogenous gene contained in bacteria present in the stool sample via
the Extraction Controls (EC), which act as sampling and extraction controls. Panel B features
an incorporated Internal Positive Control (IPC) sequence which acts to detect the presence of
any inhibitors after extraction from the primary sample. The IPC also confirms the integrity of
the PCR reagents.
7. The amplification reactions in presence of the EP005 PCR Reagents are carried out by the Life
Technologies QuantStudio Dx or Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx thermocycler systems.
The real-time PCR software displays all collected data and provides the raw threshold cycle
(Ct) values for automated analysis using software tools developed by Genetic Signatures.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Genetic Signatures GS1
2. Specimen Identification:
Each specimen barcode is scanned into the system by the user when loading the sample tube
into the pedestal. Specimen barcodes are tracked by software tools developed by Genetic
Signatures through nucleic acid extraction, PCR setup, run, and result analysis, as well as
K232672 - Page 4 of 30

--- Page 5 ---
through result reporting into Laboratory Information Systems at the Customer / End User
establishment.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are aliquoted into a reagent tube and heated for 3base conversion. After the heating
step, the inoculated sample tubes are scanned and loaded onto the GS1 instrument. During
extraction, the instrument pipettes samples into the processing plate and, at the end of the
process, into the final elution plate. These samples are then pipetted by GS1 from the extraction
elution plate into the PCR plate. Sample placements in the elution and PCR plates are tracked
via the software.
4. Calibration:
At each semi-annual preventative maintenance, the instrument is calibrated using a
manufacturer calibration block and software. If an instrument is found to be out of calibration,
alignment is checked and adjusted as needed, then calibration is repeated.
5. Quality Control:
Upon installation, qualification procedures for installation (IQ), operation (OQ), and
performance (PQ) are completed by Genetic Signatures to verify performance of the
instrument and assay. After each preventative maintenance, OQ is performed. A daily
maintenance and weekly maintenance are required before operating the instrument.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Site-to-site reproducibility of the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit was evaluated
in two (2) separate studies—the first study with four (4) targets, namely, D. fragilis, C. parvum,
E. bieneusi, and E. intestinalis; and a second study with remaining four (4) targets, namely, C.
cayetanensis, B. hominis, E. histolytica, and G. intestinalis—as described below.
A. First Study (D. fragilis, C. parvum, E. bieneusi, and E. intestinalis)
For the indicated targets, site-to-site reproducibility of the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite
Detection Kit was evaluated at three (3) clinical sites, two (2) in the US and one (1) outside the
US (OUS), with two (2) operators at each site for ten (10) days.
For each of the indicated target analyte, a sample panel was contrived by spiking an unpreserved
negative stool matrix with varying analyte concentrations relative to the target’s pre-determined
LoD, e.g., a Low Positive (LP) at 2X LoD and a Moderate Positive (MP) at 4X LoD. Each panel
also featured a True Negative (TN) sample, a negative clinical stool sample with no (or an
undetectable amount of the) target analyte.
Each positive panel member was tested in triplicate for each of five (5) extraction runs resulting
in a total of 90 (i.e., 3 x 2 x 5 x 3) data points per panel member. The negative samples were tested
at the three (3) sites by two (2) operators at each site for a total of ten (10) extraction runs in
triplicate resulting in a total of 180 (i.e., 3 x 2 x 10 x 3) data points.
B. Second Study (C. cayetanensis, B. hominis, E. histolytica, and G. intestinalis)
For the indicated targets, site-to-site reproducibility of the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite
Detection Kit was evaluated at one (1) external clinical site in the US and one (1) in-house site
outside the US with three (3) operators at each site for five (5) to seven (7) days.
Panel members B. hominis, E. histolytica, and G. intestinalis were tested in triplicate for each of
five (5) or six (6) extraction runs resulting in a total of 99 (i.e., 3 x 5 x 3 + 3 x 6 x 3) data points
per panel member, whereas C. cayetanensis was tested in-house in triplicate for each run resulting
in a total of 54 (i.e., 3 x 6 x 3) data points at 2X LoD (LP) and a total of 51 (i.e., 3 x 5 x 3 + 2 x 1
x 3) data points at 4X LoD (MP) concentration. The negative samples (TN) were tested in triplicate
at the two (2) sites by three (3) operators at each site, resulting in a total of 165 (i.e., 3 x 12 x 3 +
2 x 2 x 3 + 3 x 5 x 3) data points.
Due to operational difficulties with C. cayetanensis organisms (i.e., unreliable sourcing, isolates
not culturable, transit degradation, time constraints, etc.), testing at adequate numbers could not
be completed at the US site and additional testing to fulfil the replicate number requirements was
carried out at the OUS site with two (2) operators, testing the target analyte in twelve (12) replicates
per run and two (2) runs per operator, resulting in an additional total of 48 (i.e., 2 x 2 x 12) data
points.
C. Results of site-to-site reproducibility studies.
Analyte-specific site-to-site qualitative reproducibility testing results from both studies are
presented in Tables 1 and 2 below as percent agreement (Correct/Total) of tested valid samples

with expected results (i.e., proportion of correctly estimated sample over total samples), along with
the 95% confidence intervals. Samples testing invalid were removed from analysis.

§ C. cayetanensis results are excluded from the site-to-site reproducibility considerations.
For all targets evaluated at >1 sites (which excludes C. cayetanensis), the overall site-to-site
qualitative reproducibility percent agreement was 100% for all targets at the Low Positive (2X
LoD) analyte level, as well as for all targets except C. parvum at the Medium Positive (4X LoD)
analyte level. Overall detection of C. parvum at 4X LoD across all testing sites was at 98.9% (95%
CI: 93.8–99.9). C. cayetanensis was not assessed for site-to-site reproducibility. Within-site
reproducibility for C. cayetanensis (tested twice at a single site) was 97.1% (95% CI: 91.64–99.39)
for LP samples and 100% (95% CI: 96.3–100) for MP samples. All True Negative (TN) samples
(100%) were correctly identified in these tests.

Therefore, the analysis of site-to-site qualitative reproducibility of the EasyScreen
Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit showed acceptably consistent performance of the EP005
workflow across all test sites.
2. Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity:
Analytical reactivity (inclusivity) of the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit was
investigated by testing eighty-two (82) isolates representing the eight (8) target parasites (with 4–
16 isolates per target, as available) (as shown in Table 3). Isolates were selected to represent
various temporal, geographic, and phylogenetic diversity for each analyte. Isolates tested represent
clinically relevant subspecies or serotypes and are biased toward more common species and known
human pathogens. For clinically relevant organisms, genotypes were established with sequence-
based analysis using genotyping assays and review of published literature.
For inclusivity testing, organisms were initially diluted to 1X–3X LoD for the corresponding target
in unpreserved negative stool or transport media with preservative (C. cayetanensis only) and
tested with the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit, which detected all isolates at
all tested concentrations.

3. Analytical Specificity/Cross reactivity:
A. Whole organism/genome wet testing:
Analytical Specificity or cross-reactivity of the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection
Kit was established by testing a total of 94 different organisms (including viruses, bacteria, yeasts,
and protozoa), as well as some commonly used microbiological media, in the EasyScreen
Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection assay. In the whole organism/genome wet testing study,
isolates from cultures, where available, or purified nucleic acids were diluted in negative stool
matrix to a range of 106–109 CFU or copies/mL, with the exception of Entamoeba dispar which
could not be procured at a sufficiently high concentration, or in a culturable form, to achieve the
desired concentration and was tested at 1.5 x 103 organisms/mL. The potential cross reactants
were tested in triplicate, with acceptance criteria for no cross-reactivity set at no positive replicate
for a given target in Panels A–C of the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection assay.
The study results showed no cross-reactivity the viral, fungal, bacterial, and protozoal
microorganisms tested at the concentrations indicated in Table 4. None of the microbiological
media used for organism propagation were cross-reactive either. However, the whole
organism/genome wet testing study demonstrated three (3) cross-reacting protozoa—all of which
were predicted from in silico alignments with their congeneric protozoa in the Panels A and C of
the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection assay:
i. Cryptosporidium muris (Strain Waterborne P104, tested at 6.25 x 105 organisms/mL),
positive signal in Panel A.
ii. Encephalitozoon cuniculi (ATCC 50789, tested at 106 organisms/mL), positive signal in
Panel C, and
iii. Encephalitozoon hellem (ATCC 50604, tested at 5 x 105 organisms/mL), positive signal in
Panel C.

B. In silico analysis:
Sequence alignments were performed to identify organisms of high similarity using the BLAST
tool to interrogate sequences in GenBank. Sequences with identity of 90–100% to the target
sequence were analyzed in silico for cross reactivity potential where the organisms were not
available for wet testing, with a focus on sequence identity under the EP005 primer and probe
regions. When assessing the likelihood of cross reactivity, the number of mismatches and location
of the mismatches were considered. The location of a mismatch was defined as “significant” if

located within the first 5 nucleotides at the 3’ end of the primer. (“Significant location” is not
applicable to location of mismatches within probes.)
Organisms were assigned into three (3) categories indicating their potential to cross-react based
on the GenBank sequence match to the primers and probes (in the context of the “3base”
sequences), namely,
(i) High level of sequence match with up to 5 mismatches with non-significant locations (cross
reactive potential: High).
(ii) Moderate level of sequence match with 4-6 mismatches that have non-significant locations
(cross reactive potential: Moderate).
(iii) Low level of sequence match with 7 or more mismatches including in significant locations
(cross reactive potential: Low).
For potentially cross-reactive organisms, literature searches were also conducted to identify
whether any such organisms were known to infect humans. The results of in silico analyses are
summarized in Table 5 (potential cross reactants with no clinical relevance) and 6 (potential cross
reactants with clinical relevance as assessed from published literature) below.

organisms were generally not available in either a culturable form or as clinical samples. For their
further testing, synthetic double-stranded DNA targets—incorporating the T7 promoter at the 5’
end of the sequence—were commercially designed (‘gBlock’ from IDT) from the Accession
numbers in Table 6. Alternatively, where available, whole genome sequences (approximately
800–1000bp in length) were commercially obtained. These sequences were used to make synthetic
in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA. After quantification, the IVT RNA was extracted using the
SP008B kit at between 108 and 109 copies/mL (see below) and tested with the EasyScreen
Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit. Results are presented in Table 7. With the exception of
the Chilomastix mesnili. and Entamoeba dispar, all in silico targets of clinical relevance that were
predicted to cross-react in the cognate EasyScreen assay tested positive in that assay.

^ Wet-testing of E. dispar whole organism was negative at low copy number (Table 4), but it was se-
lected for wet-testing with synthetic targets at a high copy number (109 copies/mL).
Therefore, wet testing of whole organisms or whole genomes or of synthetic RNA informed by in
silico analysis identified the following seven (7) human pathogenic protozoa that are congeneric
to two (2) target protozoal parasites in the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit and
cross-react with the EP005 assays: Cryptosporidium meleagridis, C. tyzzeri, C. canis, C. felis, C.
muris, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, and E. hellem.
4. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Twenty-three (23) biological and chemical substances that may be present in clinical stool
specimens were evaluated for potential interference with the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite
Detection Kit with three (3) target analytes—one (1) representative chosen per panel, namely,
Dientamoeba fragilis (Panel A), Giardia intestinalis / lamblia (Panel B), and Enterocytozoon
bieneusi (Panel C)—tested at 2X LoD. Interferent concentrations chosen for evaluation were
determined from the recommendations of FDA-recognized Consensus Standard CLSI EP37 along
with a review of analytical studies from prior FDA-cleared GI panel devices. In ten (10) replicates
tested, Interference (I) was defined as <100% target positivity (≤9/10) achieved OR a change of
>15% in the average Ct values in test (i.e., with interferent) samples relative to baseline (i.e., no
interferent). Of all substances evaluated (as shown in Table 8), two (2) of the tested substances
(i.e., Whole Blood and Mucin) exhibited potential interference at different concentrations tested
with the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit assay.

Parasite Detection Kit as potential interferents. (I = Interference noted.)

Whole blood and Mucin demonstrated potential interference with the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal
Parasite Detection Kit at concentrations greater than 0.63% and 0.75 mg/mL, respectively. This is
indicated as a limitation in labeling.
5. Analytical Specificity/Mixed infections:
A. Microbial Interference:
The microbial interference study was designed to evaluate the ability of the EasyScreen
Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit to detect low positive target analytes in presence of high
concentrations of extraneous non-protozoal micro-organisms that may be present in high
concentrations in clinical stool specimens. All target analytes in Panel A–C of the EasyScreen
Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit were tested at 2X LoD in a negative stool matrix in presence
or absence of the following eight (8) selected bacterial or fungal isolates at 106 CFU/mL:
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 47085DQ), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 700802DQ),
Candida albicans (ATCC MYA-2876D-5), Bacteroides fragilis (ATCC 25285D-5),
Clostridioides perfringens (ATCC 13124DQ), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883DQ), non-
pathogenic Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922DQ), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ATCC MYA-
796).
In the ten (10) target replicates tested, relative to baseline (i.e., with no interferent), microbial
interference (I) was defined as <100% target positivity (≤9/10) achieved OR a change of >15% in
the average Ct values in test (i.e., with interferent) samples; moderate microbial interference (MI)
was defined as 100% (10/10) target positivity but showing 11–15% change in test Ct values;
whereas no reportable interference (NI) was defined at 100% (10/10) target positivity with test Ct
changes at or below 10%.
In the presence of potential microbial interferents in the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite
Detection assay, all targets showed <10% change in average Ct values relative to baseline, with
100% (10/10) target positivity amongst replicates. Therefore, no microbial interference was
observed when testing target organisms with the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection
Kit.
B. Competitive Interference:
The competitive interference study was designed to evaluate the ability of the EasyScreen
Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit to detect low positive target analytes in presence of high
concentrations of potential competitor co-target protozoan analyte(s) that may be present in high
concentrations in clinical stool specimens. All target analytes in Panel A–C of the EasyScreen
Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit were tested at 2X LoD in a negative stool matrix in presence
or absence of other targets as shown in Table 8. Targets used as potential competitors were tested
at 105 org/mL (whole organisms) except for C. cayetanensis, for which a synthetic in vitro
transcribed RNA target was used at 108 copies/mL to serve as a high concentration competitor.
As before, in the ten (10) target replicates tested, relative to baseline (i.e., with no competitor),
competitive interference (I) was defined as <100% target positivity (≤9/10) achieved OR a change
of >15% in the average Ct values in test (i.e., with competitor) samples; moderate competitive
interference (MI) was defined as 100% (10/10) target positivity but showing 11–15% change in
test Ct values; whereas no reportable interference (NI) was defined at 100% (10/10) target
positivity with test Ct changes at or below 10%.
K232672 - Page 20 of 30

--- Page 21 ---
In the course of these studies, moderate competitive interference was observed when testing low
positive (2X LoD) D. fragilis and G. intestinalis targets with C. cayetanensis and E. histolytica
competitors, respectively, with average Ct change of 12% and 11% (relative to baseline). Further,
competitive interference (at 20% positivity) was seen with low positive D. fragilis and B. hominis
targets with C. parvum and E. histolytica competitors, respectively. These were resolved upon
reducing the competitor concentrations to 5 x 104 org/mL and 104 org/mL, respectively. However,
a limitation is included in labeling to recommend testing with other methods upon a negative assay
if D. fragilis or B. hominis is clinically suspected. All other low positive targets were successfully
detected by the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit when combined with other
competing targets at a high concentration, as shown in Table 9 below.

6. Specimen Stability:
To provide evidence in support of the stability of specimens stored for testing with the EasyScreen
Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit, a range of storage conditions were evaluated using the
methodology described below.
A. Specimen stability at 2–8oC.
From the EP005 Panels A–C, individual target analytes (i.e., whole organisms for targets except
C. cayetanensis, which employed a synthetic RNA target) were spiked at 3X LoD into unpreserved
negative stool matrix or Cary-Blair medium. Failure of testing in negative stool matrix at 3X LoD
for C. cayetanensis and B. hominis necessitated re-testing at 10X LoD for these two (2) targets in
the negative stool matrix.
Baseline (time zero) test results were established by testing the contrived samples with EasyScreen
Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit on the day of preparation. Aliquots prepared for each

analyte in each matrix were stored at 2–8oC for at least (3) weeks with weekly testing and
acceptance criteria set at 100% positivity (10/10 replicates). Based on the test observations, all
target analytes are stable for three (3) weeks in unpreserved negative stool matrix. For analytes in
Cary Blair matrix, except C. cayetanensis and E. histolytica, all targets are stable for three (3)
weeks, whereas C. cayetanensis and E. histolytica are stable for two (2) weeks in the Cary Blair
matrix.
B. Fresh vs. Frozen specimen stability:
A fresh versus frozen study was conducted to support the use of frozen samples in the analytical
studies and to provide a scientific rationale for the acceptable use of frozen prospective (Category
II) and retrospective (Category III) samples in the clinical studies with the EasyScreen
Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit. Individual sample dilutions were prepared for each analyte
in the Panels A–C in unpreserved negative stool matrix, including Negative (no target, 10
replicates), Low Positive (2X LoD, 20 replicates) and Moderately Positive (4X LoD, 10
replicates) samples. Baseline (“fresh”) test results were established by testing the contrived
samples on the day of sample preparation. Aliquots of each analyte at each concentration were
stored frozen at -20 ± 5°C and thawed for examination at four (4) weeks (28–30 days). Acceptance
criteria for replicate results of each analyte were set at: 4X LoD, 100% (10/10 replicates) positive;
2X LoD, ≥95% (≥19/20) positive; and Negative, 0% (0/10) positive.
All eight (8) target parasites showed 100% detection at 4X LoD and ≥95% detection at 2X LoD
at the 4-week timepoint after being frozen at -20 ± 5°C, except for B. hominis, which was tested
at earlier at 3 weeks due to time constraints. Average Ct values at the 4-week timepoint (3-week
timepoint for B. hominis) were within ±10 % of the baseline average Ct values for all targets and
concentrations assessed. The results supported a frozen storage stability claim of three (3) weeks
for all targets other than B. hominis (frozen storage stability of two (2) weeks for B. hominis was
acceptable) when tested with the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit following
manufacturer’s instructions.
7. Detection Limit:
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection / LoD) of the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite
Detection Kit was established for all targets in a matrix of either unpreserved confirmed negative
stool or Cary Blair media. All samples were evaluated following the device’s Instructions for Use.
LoD, evaluated from two (2) isolates per target, is expressed in organisms (org/mL) or genome
copy number (copies/mL) per mL of sample, where one organism is defined as one (1) haploid
genome, determined by digital PCR or quantitative PCR for either the 18S rRNA gene, or a single-
copy gene target, and where necessary, divided by the published 18S rRNA gene copy number for
that organism.
Following a preliminary range-finding study, LoDs were established with a minimum of twenty
(20) extraction replicates using two (2) different isolates (or two (2) strains/genotype, where
available) for each target. For LoD confirmation, the acceptance criteria were set at ≥95% detection
of the specified target AND <95% detection at 0.5X LoD. When the acceptance criteria were not
met in the first instance, targets were tested at 2-times lower or higher concentration as required
until the criteria were met. These studies employed both AB 7500DX and QSDX analyzers. The
results of the LoD studies showed comparable performance with minimal variability observed
between LoD values obtained across different isolates, PCR analyzers and EP005 reagent batches
with all targets showing an LoD within a ±2-fold dilution across all variables. The final LoD for
each organism was defined for each sample matrix as the lowest concentration tested meeting the
LoD criteria when results were combined for all instruments and kit lots tested (see Table 10).

8. Assay Cut-Off:
For all target parasites, cut-off values for threshold Cycle (Ct) were determined in analytical
studies on both QSDX and AB7500 DX thermocyclers and verified using the multi-site clinical
study data. Target-specific cut-offs (defining a negative) were determined during analytical studies
using Ct values recorded for LoD or near LoD samples. For each targeted analyte, sample Ct value
metrics from the clinical studies were directly compared to the Reference method (i.e., alternative
NAAT followed by bidirectional sequencing, as indicated in FDA’s Class II Special Controls
Guideline: Gastrointestinal Microorganism Multiplex Nucleic Acid-Based Assays for Detection
and Identification of Microorganisms and Toxin Genes from Human Stool Specimens) and used a
mathematical validation approach that avoided false negatives and shifted false positive calls to
negative calls while retaining the near LoD sample Ct values to positive calls. The accepted and
locked in cut-off Ct values for each target (see Table 11 below) were applied to the results of the
candidate assay. Apart from target-specific Ct cut-off values, cut-offs for extraction control (EC)
and internal positive control (IPC) were established as Ct ≤37 and ≤40 respectively through prior
use with other stool-based EasyScreen assays from Genetic Signatures.

9. Carry-Over / Cross Contamination:
A carry-over study was conducted to investigate the potential for cross contamination or carry over
between wells when using the workflow of the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit.
Pooled high positive samples were prepared containing one representative member of each panel
(Cyclospora cayetanensis, Giardia lamblia and Enterocytozoon bieneusi) consisting of at least 1
x 106 copies/mL of each target in vitro transcript (IVT) in negative stool matrix, following the
recommendations provided in FDA-recognized voluntary consensus standard CLSI EP39. IVTs

were used in this study as most of the analytical targets available were not able to be extracted at
the high copy numbers required. A negative sample was prepared containing negative stool matrix
containing no target analyte and tested in one stage.
Sixteen (16) replicates of pooled high positive sample and fourteen (14) replicates of negative
sample were extracted in each run in an alternating negative and positive sample pattern. In this
sample pattern, there were 6 and 8 negative wells surrounded by, respectively, 4 and 3 positive
wells around them. A total of five (5) extractions and PCR setups were performed with each run
containing one negative processing control and thirty (30) samples, which were then seeded into
96 wells of a PCR plate by the GS1 platform. Since each panel gets one set of reagents, one
representative organism per panel is acceptable. Target detection in PCR was assessed for all
samples, with pre-defined acceptance criteria met at 100% (240/240) detection for pooled high
positive samples and 0% detection for negative samples (0/210) and the negative processing
control (0/15), demonstrating that in the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit
workflow, there was no reportable carry over/cross contamination between the wells during sample
preparation or PCR set up.

2. Matrix Equivalency between Cary-Blair and C&S:
A matrix equivalency study was conducted in support of the use of C&S media (e.g., Meridian
Parapak #900612) as an alternative to Cary Blair media (e.g., Thermo Scientific Remel #R21610)
when storing and/or transporting human clinical stool specimens for later processing with the
EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit. For each analyte in the Panels A–C, individual
sample dilutions were prepared in C&S matrix to include Negative (no analyte), Low Positive
(1X–2X LoD), and High Positive (5X LoD) samples. Performance characteristics of the samples
contrived in C&S media were ascertained at the selected analyte levels using five (5) extraction
replicates of High Positives, twenty-five (25) replicates of Low Positives, and ten (10) replicates
of Negative samples. Acceptance criteria for replicate results of each analyte were set at: 5X LoD,
100% (5/5 replicates) positive; 1–2X LoD, ≥95% (≥24/25) positive; and Negative, 0% (0/10) positive.
For each target, the initial LoD values previously obtained with Cary-Blair matrix during
Analytical Sensitivity studies served as the baseline for this study. As shown in Table 12, for all
targets and analyte concentrations tested, the targets diluted in C&S matrix met the acceptance
criteria based on LoD in Cary Blair matrix, demonstrating equivalence for use in the EasyScreen
Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection Kit.

C Clinical Studies:
Clinical Study details:
A multicenter clinical study was conducted to assess the performance of the EasyScreen
Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection kit for the identification of Cryptosporidium spp., Cyclospora
cayetanensis, Giardia intestinalis, Dientamoeba fragilis, Entamoeba histolytica, Blastocystis
hominis, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Encephalitozoon intestinalis using stool specimens from
symptomatic patients with suspected gastroenteritis. The study evaluated results obtained with the
EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite Detection kit, in comparison to those obtained with a
reference method. Following FDA’s Class II Special Controls Guidelines “Gastrointestinal
Microorganism Multiplex Nucleic Acid-Based Assays for Detection and Identification of
Microorganisms and Toxin Genes from Human Stool Specimens” the reference method for the
clinical studies was chosen to be two (2) well-characterized and validated Nucleic Acid
Amplification Tests (NAAT) followed by bi-directional sequencing (referred to as “alternative
NAAT”).
For the clinical study, sites were selected based on several criteria, including investigator and study
staff availability, number of specimens of interest, target prevalence and familiarity with PCR
methodology. The three (3) participating US sites for prospective sample collection and testing
were geographically diverse by location, and an additional US site performed retrospective sample
procurement along with testing.
The clinical study was designed in an All-Comers mode to prospectively collect stool samples
from symptomatic subjects to be tested fresh (Category I samples) or after frozen storage
(Category II samples). Stool specimens were collected from patients of any age (ranging <5 to ≥60
years), who presented with signs and/or symptoms of gastroenteritis and were referred for testing.
However, given the low prevalence of some of the target parasites in specific geographic areas as
well as problems in enrollment during COVID-19 pandemic-adjacent times, the enrollment of
retrospective, positive-identified (Category III) samples was considered acceptable along with the
inclusion of randomly distributed negative samples, all to be tested in a masked/blinded manner.
Finally, for two (2) low-prevalence target parasites, namely, E. bieneusi and E. intestinalis, for
which retrospective samples were not available despite best efforts, contrived (Category IV)
samples in a negative stool matrix were prepared and enrolled at an outside the US (OUS) internal
site for testing at the US sites.

All specimens were processed with the EasyScreen Sample Processing Kit using the automated
Genetic Signatures GS1 platform and tested with the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Parasite
Detection kit (hereafter collectively referred to as “EP005”) device following manufacturer’s
instructions.
True analyte status (“positive” or “negative”) of each sample was established for each target
parasite by comparison with the reference method of alternative NAATs conducted at the OUS
site. For each target analyte, the alternative NAATs consisted of two (2) separate single-plex, PCR
amplification tests which targeted regions not covered by or adjacent to the EP005 assay reagents.
Amplicons from all PCR-positive reactions sequenced with bi-directional Sanger sequencing at
the internal site. Samples producing sequence data that met the acceptability criteria listed in
Section VII(D)(1) of the Class II Special Controls guidelines were reported as positive by
alternative NAAT.
Results from the EP005 device were also compared against an FDA-cleared assay following its
device labeling. In this comparison, only those three (3) protozoan targets were evaluated that are
detected by the comparator—namely, Giardia lamblia (a.k.a. G. intestinalis), Cryptosporidium
species hominis and parvum, as well as Entamoeba histolytica. Category III samples enrolled in
the EP005 clinical study were not tested with the comparator that is not validated for use with that
specimen type.
A total of 2,806 specimens (Categories I–IV) were collected with 880 samples excluded due to
invalid and/or missing data, storage and volume limitations, improperly contrived samples with
incorrect targets, which left 1,926 analyzable specimens for performance evaluation (see Table
13).

retrospective (n = 265) clinical samples were available for analysis with both EP005 and
corresponding alternative NAAT reference method. Addition of Category IV samples (n = 165)
with E. bieneusi and E. intestinalis brought the total analyzable study sample count up to 1,891.
Based on evaluation of clinical study data provided from 1,891 stool specimens, the performance
of the EasyScreen Gastrointestinal Pathogen Detection Kit is acceptable with PPA for individual
target parasites ranging between 91–99% with lower limit of 95% CI at ≥80% and NPA ≥99%
when compared to the reference method.
A. Performance Estimates of EP005 relative to the Reference Method:
This section summarizes the target analyte-specific comparison of EasyScreen Gastrointestinal
Parasite Detection kit (EP005) results to the reference method for the 1,461 prospective clinical
samples, 265 retrospective clinical samples, and the 165 contrived samples with valid results on
both tests. For results from clinical studies presented in Tables 14–22, the following abbreviations
are used: all relative to the reference method, True Positive, TP; True Negative, TN; False Positive,
FP; False negative, FN; Positive Percent Agreement (sensitivity), PPA; Negative Percent
Agreement (specificity), NPA; lower (LL), upper limit (UL) of the 95% Confidence Interval (CI).
