B Indication(s) for Use:
Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test Strip 20 and Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test Dipcard 20 is a rapid,
screening test for the qualitative detection of Marijuana and their metabolites in human urine at
the cut-off concentration of 20 ng/mL.
Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test Strip 50 and Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test Dipcard 50 is a rapid,
screening test for the qualitative detection of Marijuana and their metabolites in human urine at
the cut-off concentration of 50 ng/mL.
The tests contain two formats:1) Test Strip and 2) Test Dipcard. The tests are intended for in
vitro diagnostics use. They are intended for over-the-counter use.
The tests provide only a preliminary result. To obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more
specific alternative chemical method must be used. Gas Chromatography/Mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography/Mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory
method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse
test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

D Special Instrument Requirements:

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test Strip 20 (and 50) and Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test Dipcard 20
(and 50) are competitive binding, lateral flow immunochromatographic assays for qualitatively
the detection of Marijuana and its metabolites at or above the cut-off concentration of 20 ng/ml
(and 50ng/ml). The tests are performed without the use of an instrument.
Test Strips and Test Dipcards use identical test strips made with the same chemical formulation
and manufacturing procedures.
Content of the kits: Test Strip (one test in one pouch), Desiccant (for storage purposes only),
Leaflet with instructions for use, Urine Cup (optional), Labeled Vial (optional), Plastic Bag
(optional), Mailing Box (optional)
B Principle of Operation:
Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test Strip 20 (and 50) and Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test Dipcard 20
(and 50) are competitive binding, lateral flow immunochromatographic assays that are used to
screen for the presence of Marijuana and its metabolites at or above the cut-off concentration of
20 (or 50) ng/mL in urine. The tests are performed without the use of an instrument.
When the absorbent end of the test device is immersed into the urine sample, the urine is
absorbed into the device by capillary action, mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, and flows
across the pre-coated membrane, in which Marijuana antigen is coated respectively.
K232732 - Page 2 of 14

--- Page 3 ---
When Marijuana and its metabolites level are at or above 20ng/ml or 50ng/ml (the cutoff), the
drugs in the sample bind to the antibody-dye conjugate preventing the antibody-dye conjugate
from binding to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Regions (T) of the device.
This prevents the development of a distinct colored band in the test region (T), indicating a
positive result.
When Marijuana and its metabolites levels are below 20ng/ml or 50ng/ml, antibody-dye
conjugate binds to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device.
This produces a colored band in the test region (T) which indicates a negative result.
To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C), if the test
has been performed properly.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using 3 lots each of test Strip and test Dipcard. Drug free
specimens were spiked with target drug (-)-11-nor-9-Carboxy-Δ9-THC at 0, ±75% cutoff,
±50% cutoff, ±25% cutoff and +100% cutoff of drug. The concentrations of the target drugs
were confirmed with LC/MS. Each concentration of the urine specimen was divided into
aliquots. Separate sets of blinded coded samples were assigned and randomized prior to
testing. The study was conducted by 6 operators at 3 Point-of-Care sites. Two operators per
location tested 3 aliquots at each concentration for each lot per day (3 runs/day) for 10 non-
consecutive days using one device lot per location. One operator tested the test strip format
and the second operator tested the test dipcard format. There were 1620 observations by 3
sites at 9 concentrations.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable, this device is intended for qualitative use only.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-Reactivity:
To determine cross-reactivity, drug metabolites and structurally similar compounds were tested.
All the components were added to drug-free normal human urine. Each sample was tested in 3
replicates using 3 lots of the test Strip and Dip Cards (for the 20ng/ml and 50ng/ml cut-ff
concentrations). If any positive result was observed, the compounds were further diluted with
known drug-free urine specimen sequentially to different concentrations and tested in
quintuplicate, until the highest concentration that generated a negative result was reached. The
cross-reacting substances with the lowest concentration that produced a positive result for each
cutoff was identified and is listed in the tables below (results were the same for test strip and
dipcard device formats):

Interfering substances:
To determine the interference, potentially interfering substances were added to drug-free urine
and target drugs urine with concentrations at 50% below and 50% above Cut-Off levels. These
urine samples were tested using three batches of each of the four devices (20ng/ml cut-off Strip
and Dip Card & 50ng/ml Strip and Dip Card). Compounds that showed no interference at a
concentration of 100µg/mL (albumin was tested at 100 mg/dL and ethanol was tested at 1%) are
summarized in the list below. There were no differences observed for both the strip and dip card
formats at the two different cut-offs.

Effect of Urinary Specific Gravity
The specific gravity studies were conducted on different specific gravity including 1.000,
1.010, 1.020, 1.030, 1.040 specimens with drug free urine containing (-)-11-nor-9-Carboxy- Δ9-
THC at 25ng/ml (50% below cutoff) and 75ng/ml (50% above cutoff) and 10ng/ml (50% below
cutoff) and 30ng/ml (50% above cutoff). All concentrations were confirmed with LC/MS. Each
sample was tested using two lots for each of the four devices (20ng/ml cut-off Strip and Dip
Card & 50ng/ml Strip and Dip Card). The results demonstrate that the tested range of specific
gravity does not affect the test result.
Effect of Urinary pH
The pH of an aliquot negative urine pool is adjusted to a pH range of 3 to 9 in 1 pH unit
increments and spiked with (-)-11-nor-9-Carboxy-Δ9-THC at 25ng/ml (50% below cutoff) and
75ng/ml (50% above cutoff) and 10ng/ml (50% below cutoff) and 30ng/ml (50% above cutoff).
All concentrations were confirmed with LC/MS. Each sample was tested using two lots of the for
each of the four devices (20ng/ml cut-off Strip and Dip Card & 50ng/ml Strip and Dip Card).
The result demonstrate that the tested pH range does not interfere with the performance of the
test.

Eighty (80) clinical urine samples were collected from three hospitals/drug relief reformatories.
The study was conducted by 6 nurses at three Point-of-Care sites and each site conducted one lot
test Strip and Dip Card for both the Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test 50 cutoff and the Rapid
Marijuana (THC) Test 20 cutoff. Each sample in both studies was divided into 6 individuals. All
aliquots were blindly labeled by a nonparticipant. Samples were also randomized prior to testing.
Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test 50 cut-off
Each participant only tested one format of Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test 50, one tested with strip
format another tested with Dip Card. All samples were unaltered clinical specimens, and the
concentrations were confirmed with LC/MS.
Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test 20 cut-off
Each participant only tested one format of Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test 20, one tested with strip
format another tested with Dip Card. All the samples were unaltered clinical specimens, and the
concentrations were confirmed with LC/MS.

2. Lay User Study (Home Use Consumer Study)
Specimens:
THC 20ng/ml cut-off: Drug free specimens spiked with the (-)-11-nor-9-Carboxy-Δ9-THC at
different concentrations containing 0 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 15 ng/ml, 25 ng/ml, 30 ng/ml, 40 ng/ml.
All concentrations were confirmed with LC/MS.
THC 50ng/ml cut-off: Drug free specimens spiked with the (-)-11-nor-9-Carboxy-Δ9-THC at
different concentrations containing 0 ng/ml, 25 ng/ml, 37.5 ng/ml, 62.5 ng/ml, 75 ng/ml, 100
ng/ml. All concentrations were confirmed with LC/MS.
For both the THC20 and THC 50, each concentration urine specimens were divided into 60
individual containers for a total of 360 aliquots. All concentrations were confirmed with LC/MS.
All aliquots were blindly labeled by a nonparticipant. Samples were also randomized prior to
testing. The study was conducted at three sites. Ages from 18 to 65 participated in the study.
None of the subjects had experience with a point of care drug testing product and were untrained
operators. The study included two cohorts of 360-lay-users (a total of 720 lay-users) with no
experience using this product. One cohort tested the 20ng/mL device and the other cohort of 360
tested the 50ng.mL device. Both cohorts of 360 lay-users were further divided into two groups;
one tested with strip format, the other tested with dipcard format. Each participant was provided
with the English package insert, 1 blind labeled sample, and a device. Each participant
performed only 1 test on provided specimen with one format of Rapid Marijuana (THC) Test
20ng/mL or 50ng/mL (strip or dipcard) using the English package insert as guide to perform the
test. They were asked to fill out an English questionnaire after finishing the test, 360 test results
for a total of 6 drug concentration levels were obtained from the Home Use Consumer Study for
each test (20ng/mL and 50ng/mL).
Results for both THC 20 and THC 50 are shown below:
