Norfentanyl FYL Norfentanyl 5
Tramadol TML Tramadol 100
The Chemtrue® Drug Screen Fentanyl / Tramadol Dip Card Test detects and is calibrated
against norfentanyl, the major metabolite of fentanyl in human urine. The test is available in
Single and multi-panels.
The test provides only a preliminary result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be
used in order to obtain a confirmed assay result. Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry
(GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) are the preferred
confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to the
drug test result, particularly when preliminary positive result is indicated.
The test is not intended to differentiate between drugs of abuse and prescription use of Fentanyl/
Tramadol. The test is for in vitro diagnostic use only.
The Chemtrue® Drug Screen Fentanyl / Tramadol Cup Test is a rapid lateral flow immunoassay
for the qualitative detection of Norfentanyl (FYL) 5 and Tramadol (TML) 100 drugs in human

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The devices are colloidal gold-based lateral flow immunoassays for the rapid, qualitative
detection of drugs of abuse in human urine. The tests are single-use, in vitro diagnostic devices,
which come in Dip Card or Cup formats, as indicated by the test name.
B Principle of Operation:
These devices are rapid lateral flow immunoassays in which chemically modified drugs (drug-
protein conjugates) compete with drugs that may be present in urine. On each test strip, a drug-
protein conjugate is striped on the test band of the membrane - known as the test region (T) and
K232736 - Page 6 of 17

--- Page 7 ---
the anti-drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pads are placed at the forward end of the
membrane. If target drugs are present in the urine specimen below its cut-off concentration, the
solution of the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugates moves along with the sample solution
by capillary action across the membrane to the immobilized drug-protein conjugate zone on the
test band region. The colored antibody-gold conjugates then complexes with the drug-protein
conjugates to form visible lines. Therefore, the formation of the visible precipitant in the test
band indicates a negative result. If the target drug level exceeds its cut-off concentration, the
drug/metabolite antigen competes with drug-protein conjugates on the test band region for the
limited antibody on the colored drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pad. The drug will
saturate the limited antibody binding sites and the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate
cannot bind to the drug-protein conjugate at the test region of the test strip. Therefore, absence of
the color band on the test region indicates a preliminary positive result.
A band should form in the control region (C) of the devices regardless of the presence of drug in
the sample to indicate that the test has been performed properly.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision/reproducibility studies were carried out for Norfentanyl- and Tramadol-spiked
urine controls with LC/MS confirmed concentrations of 0%, -50%, -25%, 100%, +25% and
+50% of the drug cutoff. The samples were blind coded and randomly assigned to 3
operators over 5 days of testing.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable. These devices are intended for qualitative use only.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
For each drug and cutoff, specificity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of
similarly structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. Results are expressed as a
minimum concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. The percent cross
reactivity of those compounds is listed below (if no cross reactivity was observed, the highest
concentration tested is shown as <1%):

To evaluate the effect of pH value on the test results, urine controls at ± 25% of the cutoff
value were used. Each control level was adjusted by either 1N NaOH solution or 1N HCl to
pH levels of 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0. Each test sample was
tested in duplicate.
To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, urine controls at ± 25% of the cutoff values were
spiked with deionized water or sugar to obtain specific gravities of 1.001, 1.010, 1.015,
1.020, 1.025, and 1.030. Each test sample was tested in duplicate.
The results demonstrated that pH and specific gravity do not affect the results from the
device at the conditions tested.
The analytical specificity performance for the remaining drugs (d-Amphetamine,
Secobarbital/Pentobarbital, Oxazepam, Buprenorphine, Benzoylecgonine, d,l-
Methylenedioxy methamphetamine, d-Methamphetamine, 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH,
Methadone, Morphine, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, Propoxyphene, Nortriptyline) was
established in k142396 and k153192.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section VII.A.1 above.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
All drug calibrators of the device are traceable to available commercial reference materials.
6. Detection Limit:
Characterization of how the device performs at low concentrations appears in the precision
section, VII.A.1, above.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section, VII.A.1, above.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
A consumer study was performed for all analytes to evaluate the ability of untrained users to
interpret the devices properly when given only the labeling (package insert) provided with
the devices. Lay-users (140) participated in this study from 3 intended user sites with LC/MS
confirmed urine samples in the following concentration ranges: negative, 50%, 75%, 125%
and 150% of the cutoff. Samples were created by spiking drugs into drug-free urine pool.
Each sample was aliquoted into an individual blind-labeled container. Each lay-user was
provided with a package insert in English only, 2 blind-coded samples, and one each of the
test devices (Cup/Dip Card format). The results are summarized below:
