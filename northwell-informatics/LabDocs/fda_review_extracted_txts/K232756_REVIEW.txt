systems was evaluated with Trypticase Soy Agar + 5% sheep blood (BD), Columbia Agar + 5%
sheep blood (bioMerieux), MacConkey Agar (bioMerieux), Trypticase Soy Agar + 5% sheep
blood / MacConkey Agar (BD). The use of other types of culture media has not been validated.
• Preparation of bacterial suspensions from unclaimed species from VITEK 2 or MicroScan
WalkAway systems has not been evaluated.
The following Special Conditions for Use Statements related to microbial suspension preparation
for AST were included in K220546 and are still applicable – the trade name was updated as
needed:
• This product is intended for target slides preparation for identification and suspensions
preparation for susceptibility testing from colonies grown on solid agar media plates. Do not use
for identification from liquid cultures.
• For AST application, make sure that the selected colonies are morphologically similar.
• Results obtained using the Colibrí for sample preparation with the compatible analyzers should
be used as an adjunct to clinical observations and other information available to the physician.
• The ability of the Colibrí to prepare samples for analysis with the compatible analyzers was
evaluated using only the species listed in the Inclusivity and AST Challenge studies, described in
the Performance Characteristics section of this Package Insert. The ability of the Colibrí to
prepare samples of other species for mass spectrometry analysis and AST has not been
evaluated.
• The Colibrí should be used only for preparation of target slides and microbial suspension from
isolated colonies of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species grown on solid culture
media. Colibrí is not intended for processing of yeasts, moulds, Nocardia or Mycobacteria.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Colibrí is an instrument designed to be used as an accessory for downstream matrix assisted
laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and
antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) analyzers. The Colibrí is comprised of the Colibrí
instrument (including on-board pipetting system, spreader, and nephelometer), software, primary
tubes for microbial suspension, and daily verification kit which automatically prepares target
K232756 - Page 3 of 16

--- Page 4 ---
slides for ID and microbial suspensions and purity plates for AST from isolated colonies. The
Colibrí is designed to be used in conjunction with the Copan WASPLab to automate the plate
incubation, plate management, image acquisition, colony selection, target slide preparation (for
ID), microbial suspension preparation (for AST), and purity plate preparation steps of the ID
and/or AST sample preparation workflow. Refer to the K223245 Decision Summary for the
device description and performance characteristics of the Colibrí when used with the WASPLab.
The Colibrí automates the preparation of MALDI target slides for the bioMérieux VITEK MS or
the Bruker MALDI Biotyper CA systems that are used in clinical laboratories for identification
(ID) of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species grown on plated media by MALDI-
TOF MS. Refer to the K193138 Decision Summary for the device description and performance
characteristics of the sample preparation for bacterial identification and MALDI-TOF MS
workflow.
The Colibrí also automates the preparation of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial
suspensions at a known concentration from isolated colonies for the bioMérieux VITEK 2 and
Beckman Coulter MicroScan WalkAway that are used in clinical laboratories for AST analyses.
The Colibrí is also used for purity plate preparation for purity assessments. Refer to the K220546
Decision Summary for the device description and performance characteristics of the sample
preparation for AST workflow with the bioMérieux VITEK 2. The workflow for both AST
systems is similar and both rely on isolated colony samples, although there are differences in the
Primary and Secondary Tubes. For use with the VITEK 2, the Primary Tube and Secondary
Tube are filled with saline for all organisms. For use with the Beckman Coulter MicroScan
WalkAway, the operator will need to input the correct Primary Tube (which will contain either
saline or water) in accordance with the MicroScan WalkAway IFU. The Secondary Tube will be
automatically filled with either water with PLURONIC or Mueller-Hinton Broth with 3% lysed
horse blood to prepare the final suspension in accordance with the MicroScan WalkAway IFU.
The performance characteristics of the sample preparation for AST from isolated colony
workflow with the Beckman Coulter MicroScan WalkAway are described in this submission.
B Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Colibrí
2. Specimen Identification:
Culture plates for processing are identified by the WASPLab by scanning a manually applied
linear barcode on the side of each plate. The loading conveyor moves the plate inside the
Imaging Module in the WASPLab, where the plate is checked in to the system through a
barcode reader. The barcode is again scanned when the plate is manually transferred to the
Colibrí. The barcode is used to orientate the plate and, together with the plate’s geometric
center, also used to define the Cartesian coordinates of each of the colonies that are
designated for picking. The designated colonies are then picked for the assigned downstream
activities.
K232756 - Page 4 of 16

--- Page 5 ---
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Plates labeled with a barcode on the side are loaded onto a conveyor and loaded into the
WASPLab. The barcode is scanned, and the plate is incubated within the WASPLab. After
appropriate incubation, each plate is photographed, and the image is saved on the WASPLab
server and is displayed to the operator on the WebApp interface. After selecting isolated
colonies and assigning the downstream task, the user manually transfers the plate to the
Colibrí. Within the Colibrí, the plates are prepared for ID (as described in the K193138
Decision Summary) or AST (as described in the K220546 Decision Summary).
4. Calibration:
Colibrí requires four different calibrations: one on the on-board nephelometer and three on
the cameras. No changes are made in set-up calibration, auto-calibration, and run-time
calibration checks which are performed as described in the K193138 Decision Summary. No
changes are made to daily nephelometer verification, which is performed as described in the
K220546 Decision Summary.
The WASPLab does not require calibration.
5. Quality Control:
Quality Control for AST testing was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions for the Beckman Coulter MicroScan. CLSI-recommended reference strains
Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus
aureus ATCC 29213, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 were grown on trypticase soy
agar + 5% sheep blood. Microbial suspensions were prepared using three separate Colibrí
instruments and loaded in the appropriate MicroScan panel. MIC values for each
drug/organism combination were compared to the established ranges reported in the
MicroScan panel labeling. Purity of all the suspensions was confirmed by purity plates
prepared by the Colibrí, with 100% of purity plates showing monomicrobial growth. Quality
control testing was performed daily during analytical performance testing using the quality
control bacterial strains in rotation, and all results obtained were in-range. Results are
summarized in Table 1. The quality control testing is acceptable.
Quality control for bacterial identification is described in the K193138 Decision Summary.
Quality control for AST with the bioMérieux VITEK 2 was conducted in a similar manner
and is described in the K220546 Decision Summary. Additional quality control measures are
not needed for the WASPLab.

VII Performance Characteristics:
The performance of the Colibrí was evaluated in conjunction with the Beckman Coulter
MicroScan WalkAway using the criteria for MIC interpretation as described in the MicroScan
labeling.
Refer to the K193138 Decision Summary for the performance characteristics of the sample
preparation for bacterial identification and MALDI-TOF MS workflow. Refer to the K220546
Decision Summary for the performance characteristics of the sample preparation for the AST
workflow with bioMérieux VITEK 2. Refer to the Decision Summary for K223245 for the
performance characteristics of sample preparation with WASPLab for downstream ID and AST.
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of MIC results obtained using microbial suspensions automatically
prepared from isolated colonies by the Colibrí was evaluated with the Beckman Coulter
MicroScan WalkAway. Inter-operator reproducibility of the Colibrí was previously
demonstrated in K220546 and K223245. For the reproducibility study with the MicroScan,
three Colibrí instruments paired with one WASPLab instrument were used to prepare
microbial suspensions from overnight (18 to 24 hour) cultures of 18 representative, clinically
relevant bacterial isolates grown on trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood. Representative
MicroScan AST panels were chosen for analysis and were tested with pure colonies of nine
gram-negative isolates and nine gram-positive isolates (summarized in Table 2). Each panel
included drugs representing different drug classes.

Each isolate was tested in triplicate on three separate days using the appropriate MicroScan
panel. On each day of testing, one operator designated at least four (for gram negative) or six
(for gram positive) colonies for automated picking from digital images acquired by the
WASPLab of each of the three culture plates corresponding to each isolate. A minimum of
117 MIC results were analyzed per panel per instrument.
Samples were prepared and assessed for purity consistent with the Colibrí instructions for
use. The final suspension in the Secondary Tube was used to manually inoculate the
appropriate MicroScan AST panel. The secondary tubes and corresponding AST cards were
processed by one MicroScan WalkAway instrument. The reported MIC values were used to
calculate within-run and between-run reproducibility.
Reproducibility was calculated as the total number of MIC results that were within one
doubling dilution of the mode result divided by total number of results. Both best-case
(assumes that off-scale results are within one dilution of the mode) and worst-case (assumes
that off-scale results are more than one dilution of the mode) performance was determined
for each antimicrobial, as outlined in the AST Special Controls Guidance.
In total, 2,619 MIC results were generated with 2,602 of those results being on-scale. The
results for all samples are summarized and stratified by the tested MicroScan panel in Table
3. For antimicrobials across all panels evaluated, the combined best-case reproducibility was
≥95% and combined worst-case reproducibility was ≥89%. All purity plates displayed
monomicrobial growth. The reproducibility results are acceptable.

4. Accuracy (Instrument):
Microbial Suspension Accuracy
The ability of the Colibrí to prepare accurate microbial suspensions in Primary and
Secondary Tubes compatible for use with the Beckman Coulter MicroScan WalkAway was
assessed using representative organisms. Isolated colonies were used by the Colibrí to
automatically prepare microbial suspensions. Briefly, four microorganisms (E. coli, P.
aeruginosa, S. aureus and E. faecalis) were individually plated on trypticase soy agar + 5%
sheep blood and incubated for 18-24 hours. Streptococcus microbial suspensions were
previously evaluated in K220546 and taken together with the AST accuracy study described
herein (in which 48 Streptococcus isolates were evaluated), the results were deemed
acceptable. Accuracy of microbial suspensions prepared with the Colibrí from MacConkey
and Chocolate agar media was evaluated in K220546. One operator viewed the plate images
acquired by one WASPLab instrument and designated four (for gram-negative) or six (for
gram-positive) colonies for picking. Three Colibrí instruments were used to prepare Primary
Tubes and Secondary Tubes. Secondary Tubes were manually diluted, plated in triplicate,
and incubated overnight to determine colony counts and calculate concentration (CFU/mL).
Concentrations were deemed acceptable if they were within the expected ranges reported in
the AST Special Controls guidance (3-7x105 CFU/mL for E. coli) or CLSI M07 (2-8x105
CFU/mL) documents. Accuracy was calculated as the percentage of Secondary Tubes with
microbial concentrations within the expected range. At least 30 microbial suspensions were
prepared for each species. For the tested species, Primary Tubes were filled with saline and
Secondary Tubes were filled with MicroScan Inoculum Water with PLURONIC, in
accordance with the MicroScan IFU. The summary of agreement between the expected
concentration and the concentration calculated by colony count is shown in Table 4 below,
stratified by Colibrí instrument and microorganism. Agreement for each species and each
instrument was ≥95% and overall agreement was ≥98%. The microbial suspension accuracy
results are acceptable.

Accuracy of AST Results
The accuracy of MICs obtained by the Beckman Coulter MicroScan WalkAway with
microbial suspensions prepared by the Colibrí was evaluated by testing representative
MicroScan panels with isolated colonies of clinically relevant gram-negative and gram-
positive bacteria. Three different Colibrí instruments with one WASPLab operated by three
different operators were used to prepare suspensions for testing of from colonies of 110
representative isolates of different species of Enterobacterales (n=50), Staphylococcus spp.
(n=20), Streptococcus spp. (n=12), Enterococcus spp. (n=18), and non-fermenting gram-
negative bacilli (n=10) grown on trypticase soy agar + 5 % sheep blood and/or MacConkey
agar. Refer to Table 2 for the panels included in the AST challenge study.
MicroScan panels containing broad concentrations of antimicrobials representative of major
drug classes (Table 2) were tested with representative clinical isolates: NM-NF50 covering
Enterobacterales and non-fermenters, PM-E37 covering Staphylococci and Enterococci, and
MSP6 covering Streptococci. Use of these panels is acceptable because a wider MIC range
was validated with the same sample type (i.e., colonies) and determined to be acceptable, as
described in the applicable MicroScan decision summaries. Twenty-nine different
antimicrobial agents were analyzed, resulting in a total of 1,232 MIC results.
The MIC results obtained with suspensions prepared from isolated colonies by the Colibrí
and tested on the MicroScan WalkAway system were compared to the results from manually
prepared samples and the MicroScan WalkAway system. Manual samples were prepared
from isolated colonies consistent with the MicroScan system instructions for use.
Essential Agreement (EA) was defined as MIC results from Colibrí prepared samples that
were within one doubling dilution of the MIC results from the manually prepared samples.
Category Agreement (CA) was defined as MIC interpretations (S/I/R) that were the same
between the Colibrí-prepared and manually prepared samples. Very major errors were
defined as false susceptible results from the Colibrí-prepared samples, major errors were
defined as false resistance results from the Colibrí-prepared samples, and minor errors were

defined as results with minor discrepancies (i.e., an intermediate result reported as either
resistant or susceptible, or vice versa). Since this is a method-to-method comparison, results
were considered acceptable if the EA and CA were ≥95% with no major or very major errors.
Additionally, no significant differences should be observed between the Colibrí instruments,
operators, culture medium, or incubation time.
Overall performance of MicroScan results using microbial suspensions prepared from
isolated colonies by the Colibrí demonstrated that 1232/1232 (100%) of MIC results were
within EA and 4187/4254 (98.4%) of results were in CA, which is acceptable. No very major
or major errors occurred. All purity plates exhibited 100% monomicrobial growth.
Table 5 summarizes the results stratified by antimicrobial/organism group combinations.
Due to the high degree of agreement between MICs obtained from manual and Colibrí-
prepared samples, the AST accuracy was determined to be acceptable.

Accuracy of MIC results obtained using microbial suspensions automatically prepared by the
Colibrí for use with the bioMérieux VITEK 2 was previously demonstrated in K220546. The
sponsor updated the AST accuracy results tables for the VITEK 2 to the format above to
harmonize their data presentation in labeling between both downstream AST analyzers.
5. Carry-Over:
The ability of the on-board incinerator to properly sterilize the spreader after purity plate
preparation was described in K220546. Refer to the K220546 Decision Summary for
additional details.
B Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Refer to the Decision Summaries of K193138, K220546, and K223245 for supportive studies
regarding Colibrí use with bacterial ID IVD-analyzers, bioMérieux VITEK 2 AST analyzer, and
WASPLab, respectively.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
