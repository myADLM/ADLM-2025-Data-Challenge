III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of neutrophil gelatinase-associated
lipocalin (NGAL) in human urine.
Determination of NGAL is intended to be used in conjunction with clinical evaluation in
pediatric patients (≥ 3 months to < 22 years) without underlying kidney disease admitted to the
intensive care unit (ICU) for the management of cardiovascular or respiratory compromise or
who have had a solid organ or bone marrow transplant.
ProNephro AKI™ (NGAL) is intended to be used in the first 24 hours of ICU admission. In
patients with low SCr levels, indicative of no acute kidney injury (AKI) or AKI Stage 1, the test
can be used as an aid to identify patients at risk to develop moderate to severe acute kidney
injury (Stage 2/3 AKI) 48 to 72 hours after the time of assessment. In patients with an elevated
SCr level, indicative of Stage 2/3 AKI, the test can be used as an aid to identify patients at risk to
have persistent moderate to severe AKI (Stage 2/3) 48 to 72 hours after the assessment.
The particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay is intended for use on the Roche cobas® c 501
clinical chemistry analyzer.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
This kit should only be used by qualified laboratory staff.
Pediatric urine NGAL results < cutoff of 125 ng/mL are indicative of a lower risk of developing
or having persistent moderate to severe acute kidney injury (Stage 2 to 3 AKI) (within 48 to 72
hours), supported by a high negative predictive value as observed in the clinical study. However,
the development or persistence of AKI is still possible for patients with NGAL results below this
threshold.
Pediatric urine NGAL results ≥ cutoff of 125 ng/mL are indicative of a higher risk of developing
or having persistent moderate to severe acute kidney injury (Stage 2 to 3 AKI) (within 48 to 72
hours). However, the development or persistence of AKI may not occur in patients with NGAL
measurements above this threshold.
The ProNephro AKI™ (NGAL) test result cannot be used as a stand-alone result, but clinicians
must interpret the significance of an NGAL result in conjunction with the patient’s full clinical
assessment.
Results are not to be used for diagnosis.

D Special Instrument Requirements:
Roche cobas c 501 clinical chemistry analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ProNephro AKI TM (NGAL) Reagent Kit contains the following reagents:
• R1: Reaction Buffer Reagent (17.9 mL) - a ready-to-use tris-buffer solution containing
murine protein and preservative
• R2: Immunoparticle Suspension Reagent (7.65 mL) - a ready-to-use suspension of
polystyrene microparticles coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies to NGAL that also
contains preservative
The ProNephro AKI TM Reagent Kit provides enough reagents for 100 tests on the Roche cobas c
501 clinical chemistry analyzer.
The kit also includes a labeled Roche cassette and two funnels for transferring the reagent into
the Roche cassette. The reagents must be transferred to a Roche cassette prior to loading onto the
cobas c 501. This is done by pouring the R1 reagent into Position B of the cassette and R2
reagent into Position C. The operator will load the cassette onto the instrument and run the
ProNephro AKI (NGAL) test per the instructions for use.
B Principle of Operation:
A pediatric urine sample is mixed with Reaction Buffer (R1). After a short incubation, the
reaction is started by the addition of an immunoparticle suspension (microparticles coated with
mouse monoclonal antibodies to NGAL) (R2). NGAL in the sample causes the immunoparticles
to agglutinate. The degree of agglutination is quantified by the amount of light scattering,
measured as absorption of light at a wavelength of 570 nm. The absorbance change is read
approximately six minutes after the addition of R2. The NGAL concentration in the sample is
determined by interpolation on a calibration curve prepared from calibrators of known
concentrations. Calibrators and controls are prepared from recombinant NGAL that has been
value assigned against an in-house master calibrator.
An NGAL concentration below the cut-off of 125 ng/mL in pediatric urine is indicative of lower
risk of moderate to severe acute kidney injury (Stage 2/3 AKI) 48 to 72 hours after the time of
assessment and is considered a negative result. Whereas a result greater than or equal to the cut-
off of 125 ng/mL, indicates a risk of moderate to severe acute kidney injury (Stage 2/3 AKI) 48
to 72 hours after the time of assessment and is considered a positive result.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted following the recommendations in the CLSI EP05-03
guideline.
Repeatability and Intermediate Precision
The repeatability (within-run precision) and intermediate precision (within-laboratory
precision) was evaluated internally on a single Roche cobas c 501 analyzer. The protocol
consisted of testing nine native pediatric urine samples and sample pools with three lots of
reagent for 20 days with two runs per day and three replicates per sample, for a total of 360
measurements/sample. The low and high control samples were tested each day at the
beginning of the first run, between runs (except on Day 1), and at the end of the second run
in two replicates.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP06-2nd edition
guideline.
The protocol consisted of testing three different linearity sample sets, each consisting of a
native pediatric urine sample pool with a high concentration above the measuring range,
blended with a native pediatric urine sample pool with a low concentration below the
measuring range, to create 14 levels of samples. Each linearity set was tested in one run,
using one reagent lot on a single Roche cobas c 501 analyzer. Samples with an NGAL
concentration below 150 ng/mL were tested in eight replicates. Samples with an NGAL
concentration equal to or greater than 150 ng/mL were tested in four replicates.
The data was analyzed by weighted least square regression linear regression analysis. The
relative deviation degree from linearity ranged between 0.1-13.3%.
The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 50 - 3000 ng/mL.
Automatic Dilution, High-Dose Hook Effect
Automatic dilution was evaluated by testing human recombinant NGAL spiked into three
different pediatric urine sample pools at NGAL concentrations of approximately 40,000,
20,000, 10,000, and 5,000 ng/mL. The recombinant human (rh) NGAL was Amino-Acid-
Analyzed (AAA) and thereby precisely quantified. Each sample was tested in four replicates,
using the automatic re-run function of the analyzer when needed. The mean NGAL
concentration after re-run and automatic dilution was compared to the target NGAL
concentration, as determined by gravimetric dilution of a precisely quantified rhNGAL

preparation. Acceptance criteria was mean recovery ≤ ±10%. The results support the
automatic 1:15 dilution.
High dose hook effect was evaluated by testing recombinant human NGAL spiked into three
different pediatric urine sample pools at NGAL concentrations of approximately 80,000,
60,000, and 40,000, 20,000, 10,000, 5,000, 2.500 and 1.250 ng/mL NGAL. The results of the
high-dose hook effect testing support the labeling statement that there is no high-dose hook
effect up to 40,000 ng/mL NGAL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical specificity and interference testing was conducted following the recommendations
in CLSI EP07-A3 and EP37-Ed1.
Interferents were selected from endogenous urine constituents, pH and Specific Gravity,
cross reactants, contrast agents, common and special drugs.
All specificity and interference studies were performed using two sample pools with NGAL
concentrations of approximately 150 ng/mL and 1500 ng/mL, respectively, prepared by
blending a native pediatric urine sample with an elevated NGAL concentration with a
commercially available pediatric urine pool with a low NGAL concentration.
Acceptance criteria for the interference studies was mean recovery ≤ ±10%.
Endogenous Interference, pH and Specific Gravity
Endogenous interference, pH and specific gravity were evaluated on a single Roche cobas c
501 analyzer, using one reagent lot in one run. The lower concentration sample was tested in
six replicates and the higher concentration sample was tested in four replicates. The
endogenous urine constituents were evaluated at concentrations above the expected
concentrations in the intended use population. Mean concentrations of the different urine
constituents were evaluated using published data, and reduced urine volumes in pediatric
patients with AKI were considered.
The tables below summarizes the results of the interference testing for endogenous
substances, pH and SG:

Cross-Reactivity
Cross-reactivity was evaluated on a single Roche cobas c 501 analyzer, using one reagent lot
in one run. The lower concentration sample was tested in six replicates and the higher
concentration sample was tested in four replicates. The maximum concentration of the
potentially cross-reactive biomarkers tested was evaluated using published data, or package
inserts/instructions for use for the respective biomarker assays, if available. If the potentially
cross-reactive biomarker had been tested in AKI patients, at least the highest concentration
mentioned in those studies was tested.

Exogenous Interference – Common and Special Drugs
A risk assessment was performed to determine special drugs which may be most likely to
interfere with ProNephro AKI TM (NGAL) in pediatric patients. This risk analysis included
research of published data and obtaining data from PICU sites to determine drugs most
prescribed for pediatric patients with impaired kidney function and their maximum dosages
given. The list was narrowed down by excluding drugs that are known to not be excreted in
the urine. If urine concentrations of drugs had been established, a concentration of at least 3x
the reported concentration was tested. If urine concentrations were unknown, the maximum
daily therapeutic dose was calculated based on mean body weight per age group and at least
3x that therapeutic concentration was tested.
Exogenous interference by common and special drugs was evaluated on a single Roche cobas
c 501 analyzer, in one run, using in total five different reagent lots and four different lots of
calibrators and controls. The lower concentration sample was tested in six replicates, the
higher concentration sample in four replicates.
The tables below summarize the results of the interference testing for common and special
drugs:

The results of the special drugs interference testing performed with ProNephro AKI TM
(NGAL) met the sponsor’s criteria, except for Cefepime, Ceftriaxone, and Diphenhydramine.
Additional testing was done for these drugs at lower concentrations until interference was no
longer observed and the results met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of a mean recovery ≤ ±
10%.
The sponsor included the following statement in the ProNephro AKITM (NGAL) Instructions
for Use:
Cefepime was shown to interfere at concentrations above 4,063 mg/L. Patients being treated
with Cefepime may have lower than expected NGAL results.
Exogenous Interference – Immunosuppressive Agents and Special Drugs
In addition, the sponsor conducted a study to evaluate exogenous interference by
immunosuppressive agents and special drugs. Exogenous interference by immunosuppressive
agents and special drugs was evaluated on a single Roche cobas c 501 analyzer. The study
protocol consisted of testing two different pediatric urine sample pools with NGAL
concentrations of approximately 150 and 1500 ng/mL in one run with one reagent lot. The
lower concentration sample was tested in six replicates and the higher concentration sample
was tested in four replicates. The sample pools were prepared by blending one native
pediatric urine sample with an elevated NGAL concentration and one pediatric urine pool
with a low NGAL concentration. High concentration stock solutions of the potentially
interfering immunosuppressive agents and special drugs were prepared in a suitable solvent
(water, ethanol, DMSO), or the potentially interfering immunosuppressive agents and special
drugs were spiked directly into the pediatric urine sample pools.
The tables below summarize the results of the interference testing for immunosuppressive
agents and special drugs:

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The analytical measuring interval is 50 to 3000 ng/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The device is traceable to an internal reference standard (master calibrator), i.e. recombinant
human NGAL. The sponsor stated that no internationally recognized reference material for
NGAL is available. BioPorto has developed a recombinant internal reference material.
Sample Stability
Stability of stored specimens (room temperature, refrigerated storage and frozen storage) and
the effect of freezing/thawing on the measurement of NGAL on the Roche cobas c 501
analyzer were evaluated. The acceptance criteria for all stability studies were recovery
within ±10%.
Urine specimens were shown to be stable for one day at 15-30°C, 3 days at 2-8°C and 12
months at or below -70°C, up to 2 freeze/thaw cycles. Specimens were shown to withstand 2
freeze-thaw cycles when stored at or below -70°C.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) studies were
performed following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
To estimate LoB, six analyte-free samples were tested using two lots of reagent in five runs
distributed over five days with three replicates per sample on a single Roche cobas c 501
analyzer. In total, 90 determinations for analyte-free samples were obtained for each lot. The
LoB was defined as the concentration at which there is a 95% probability that the sample
does not yield a result. The results of the LoB study performed with ProNephro AKITM
(NGAL) support an LoB claim in the labeling of 9 ng/mL.
To estimate LoD, six samples with low analyte concentrations were tested with two lots of
reagent in five runs distributed over five days with three replicates per sample. LoD was
evaluated on a single Roche cobas c 501 analyzer. In total, 60 determinations for samples
with low analyte concentrations were obtained for each lot. The LoD was defined as the
lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with a 95% probability.
The results of the LoD study performed with ProNephro AKI TM (NGAL) support an LoD
claim in the labeling of 14 ng/mL.

To estimate LoQ, four samples with analyte concentrations close to the expected LoQ were
tested with two lots of reagent in five runs distributed over five days with three replicates per
sample. LoQ was evaluated on a single Roche cobas c 501 analyzer. The LoQ was defined as
the lowest concentration of analyte in a sample which can be quantified with an intermediate
precision of no more than 20% CV. The results of the LoQ study performed with ProNephro
AKI TM (NGAL) support an LoQ claim in the labeling of 18 ng/mL.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
The clinical performance of ProNephro AKI™ (NGAL) was validated in a multi-center
prospective clinical study based on the established cutoff (125 ng/mL) identifying patients at
risk of moderate to severe acute kidney injury (Stage 2 to 3 AKI) 48 to 72 hours after the
time of assessment. The study enrolled 660 pediatric patients (≥ 90 days to < 22 years of age)
at 15 sites across the US, with 514 evaluable subjects. The study population was comprised
of patients having at least one of the following leading to admission to the PICU, or
occurring within 12 hours of admission to the PICU: vasoactive medication administration,
mechanical ventilation, history of solid organ transplantation (renal transplantation included
only if more than 3 months prior), history of bone marrow transplantation or hypotension,
(having received ≥ 40 ml/kg of resuscitative fluid in pre-ICU (within 6 hours prior to ICU
admission) or in first 12 hours of ICU). Urine samples were collected from each enrolled
subject in the first 24 hours of ICU admission, were centrifuged and stored frozen until
shipping to the clinical testing site. Testing was performed on one Roche cobas c 501
analyzer. Samples were tested randomized in single determinations. Blood samples were
drawn at four timepoints (Day 0, Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3) from enrolled subjects for
serum/plasma creatinine testing. Most screen failures were due to either missing urine or
K232761 - Page 13 of 17

blood collection; exclusion of the unevaluable patients did not affect the conclusions of the
study.
The indication for use does not exclude patients with diagnosed AKI per KDIGO guidelines
or patients with elevated sCr values prior to or within the first 12 hours of ICU admission.
These patients were included in the GUIDANCE study. For these patients the ProNephro
AKI™ (NGAL) test is used to assess the risk of persistent AKI 48 to 72 hours after the time
of the NGAL assessment.
The subgroups of patients within the intended use population can be summarized into
patients that present:
1. Without a sCr value indicative of Stage 2-3 AKI at ICU admission,
a. AND developing Stage 2-3 AKI 48 to 72 hours after the time of assessment,
b. OR not developing Stage 2-3 AKI 48 to 72 hours after the time of assessment.
2. With an elevated sCr value indicative of Stage 2-3 AKI at ICU admission,
a. AND have persisting Stage 2-3 AKI 48 to 72 hours after the time of assessment,
b. OR do not have persisting Stage 2-3 AKI 48 to 72 hours after the time of assessment.
The clinical data for each subject were captured and provided to at least two independent
clinical experts for adjudication. Adjudicators were blinded to the site diagnoses and NGAL
results. Subjects were adjudicated for the determination of moderate to severe AKI by an
expert panel of clinicians following KDIGO guidelines and using clinical judgment. Urine
output information was not available for all subjects in the clinical studies, and adjudication
was done based on SCr values only. Of the 514 evaluable subjects in combined groups 1 and
2, 47 AKI (Stage 2 or 3) positive subjects were determined by adjudication (9.1%
prevalence).
The clinical performance of ProNephro AKITM (NGAL) was evaluated against adjudicated
results.
For the overall evaluable subjects, sensitivity and specificity and their corresponding 95%
confidence interval (CI) were calculated to be 72.3% (57.4-84.4%) and 86.3% (82.8-89.3%)
respectively. The negative predictive value (NPV) was 96.9% (95.1-98.0% 9) and the
positive predictive value (PPV) was 34.7% (28.5-41.5%).
The following clinical performance characteristics for sensitivity, specificity, negative
predictive value, and positive predictive value were calculated for the two subgroups of
patients within the intended use population when assessed separately.

D Clinical Cut-Off:
A multi-center prospective clinical study was conducted at six clinical sites to establish the
NGAL cutoff to identify patients at risk of moderate to severe acute kidney injury (Stage 2 to 3
AKI) 48 to 72 hours after the time of assessment. 257 pediatric patients (≥ 90 days to < 22 years
of age) were enrolled in the study with 203 evaluable subjects. The cut-off was established at
125 ng/mL with the sample collection timepoint within the first 24 hours of ICU admission.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A reference range study was performed to determine the NGAL concentrations in apparently
healthy pediatric subjects (ages from 3 months to 22 years). Samples were collected from four
geographically diverse sites in the US to ensure a variety of healthy patient samples.
Demographic and other information for the enrolled subjects is shown in the tables below.

Samples were excluded due to urinary tract infection (UTI) if at least one of the following
criteria was fulfilled:
1. Moderate to high level of leukocyte
2. Nitrite positive
The pediatric population included 348 evaluable subjects in three age groups from ≥3 months to
<2 years of age, ≥2 years to <12 years of age, and ≥12 years to <22 years of age. There was an
even distribution of males and females represented in the study, although the total number of
subjects in the youngest age group was slightly lower overall.
