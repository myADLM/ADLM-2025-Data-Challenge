IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The device consists of the components described below.
Access Intact PTH (iPTH) Reagent Pack:
• R1a: 3.25 mL, Paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-PTH antibody
suspended in TRIS buffered saline with bovine serum albumin (BSA), surfactant, < 0.1%
sodium azide, 0.1% ProClin 300.
• R1b: 3.1 mL, TRIS buffered saline with block ACE, protein (mouse, goat),
surfactant, < 0.1% sodium azide, 0.1% ProClin 300.
• R1c: 3.1 mL, Mouse monoclonal anti-PTH alkaline phosphatase conjugate in
ACES buffered saline with BSA, surfactant, < 0.1% sodium azide, 0.1% ProClin 300.
Materials Required but Not Provided
The Beckman Coulter Access Intact PTH (iPTH) Assay is designed for use in conjunction with
the following products:
• Access Intact PTH Calibrators
• Lumi-Phos PRO Substrate
• Unicell Dxl Wash Buffer II
• Access Sample Diluent A
B Principle of Operation:
The Access Intact PTH assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of intact parathyroid hormone (parathyrin, PTH) levels in human
serum and plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems. The assay principle uses a two-site
immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay, where a sample (55 μL) is added to a reaction vessel,
along with a monoclonal anti-PTH antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, TRIS buffered
saline with proteins and paramagnetic particles coated with a goat polyclonal anti-PTH antibody.
Samples may be run in one of two modes: routine mode (≤ 30 minutes from start of sample
pipetting to test result) and intraoperative mode (≤ 15 minutes from start of sample pipetting to
test result). After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field
while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the
vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production
is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is
automatically determined from a stored calibration.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Routine Mode:
A precision study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3. Five serum samples
with PTH concentrations spanning the analytical range were tested using three reagent lots
on three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers. Samples were assayed in duplicate using
2 runs per day over 20 days for a total of 80 replicates per sample per lot. Results from
multiple lots were similar. Within-run (repeatability), within-lab (total), between-run, and
between-day precision results for a representative reagent lot on a single instrument are
summarized below:

2. Linearity:
Linearity studies were performed using serum samples across the assay measuring range to
evaluate the linearity of the Access Intact PTH assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
Analyzer in accordance with the CLSI Guideline EP06-Ed2. The data was analyzed using a
weighted linear regression model. The deviation from linearity for the routine mode did not
exceed 5% and for the intraoperative mode, did not exceed 8%.
The results of these linearity studies support that the Access Intact PTH assay is linear on the
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer throughout the proposed analytical measuring
interval of 1.7 – 3,500 pg/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference was previously established in K061190. The sponsor provided information to
support that biotin up to 3500 ng/mL does not interfere with the test.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See Linearity section above.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The Access Intact PTH assay is traceable to international WHO standard 79/500.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were evaluated
based on the CLSI guideline EP17-A2. The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration of
analyte which has imprecision less than or equal to 20% CV.
