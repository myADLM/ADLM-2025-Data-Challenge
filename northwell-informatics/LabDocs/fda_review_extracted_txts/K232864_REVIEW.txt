III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I is intended for the qualitative detection of human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine, as an aid in early detection of pregnancy, in some cases
as early as five (5) days before the expected period, i.e., as early as six (6) days before the day of
the missed period.
EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II is intended for the qualitative detection of human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine, as an aid in early detection of pregnancy, in some cases
as early as five (5) days before the expected period, i.e., as early as six (6) days before the day of
the missed period.
Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
C Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I and EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II are qualitative
immunochromatographic assays consisting of a single nitrocellulose test strip assembled in a
plastic housing with an absorbent tip. The tests can be used in dip or instream mode.
B Principle of Operation:
EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I and EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II are lateral flow
chromatographic immunoassays. When the absorbent end is immersed into a sample, the sample
is absorbed into the device by capillary action and mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate
(mouse anti-beta hCG monoclonal antibody), flowing across the pre-coated (goat anti-hCG
polyclonal antibody) membrane. If present in the sample, hCG reacts with the dye conjugate and
forms a complex. The complex migrates along the membrane to the hCG antibody line (T) and
remains captured in the T line.
In the EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I test, a single red colored band develops in the test
zone (T line), indicating a positive result. If there is no hCG in the urine, there is no red band in
the test zone, indicating a negative result. In the EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II test, a
plus sign (+) appears at the T line, indicating a positive result. A single vertical line at the T line
( | ) indicates a negative result. The control line (C line) should develop in the control zone
regardless of the test result on both tests. If the control line does not appear (no color appears at
the control line after application of the sample), the test is invalid, and the specimen should be
retested with a new device.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using negative female urine samples spiked with hCG
traceable to the 5th WHO IS to obtain samples with hCG concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 6.5, 8, 9,
10, 15, 25 and 50 mIU/mL. Each sample was tested using three lots of EGENS Pregnancy
Test Midstream I and three lots of EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II. Samples were
tested in replicates of 5 per concentration, over 5 consecutive days, by 3 different operators
(1 per lot) per device, in both dip and instream sampling methods (150 total results per
concentration). The tables below summarize the precision data when both dip and instream
sampling methods are combined. The data is representative of each sampling method.

Cross-reactivity of similar compounds:
To evaluate cross-reactivity, urine pools from healthy, non-pregnant females were spiked to
contain 0, 5 and 10 mIU/mL hCG and then spiked with potential cross reactants. Samples
were spiked with 500 mIU/mL luteinizing hormone (LH), 1000 mIU/mL follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH), and 1 mIU/mL thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The samples were
tested in triplicate using 3 lots of the test by three different operators. No cross-reactivity was
observed at tested concentrations.
Effects of urine pH
To evaluate the effect of urine pH on test results, urine samples containing 0, 5 and 10
mIU/mL hCG were tested at pH values of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The samples were tested in
triplicate using three lots of the test device by 3 operators. The results demonstrated that
urine pH ranges between 4 and 9 do not affect test performance.
Effects of urine specific gravity
To evaluate the effect of urine specific gravity on test results, urine samples containing 0, 5
and 10 mIU/mL hCG were tested at specific gravities of 1.000, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020,

1.025, 1.030 and 1.035. The results demonstrated that urine with a specific gravity ranging
from 1.000 to 1.035 does not affect test performance.
Hook Effect
Negative urine samples were spiked with varying hCG concentrations up to 500,000
mIU/mL. The samples were tested in five replicates, using three lots, by three operators. All
tested concentrations gave a positive result. The results demonstrated that no hook effect was
observed at hCG concentration up to 500,000 mIU/mL.
Effects of hCG β-core fragment
Urine samples (0, 5, 10, and 20,000 mIU/mL hCG) were spiked with hCG β-core fragment
(hCGβcf) at concentrations of 50,000 pmol/L, 125,000 pmol/L, 250,000pmol/L and
500,000pmol/L. Test performance is not affected by hCG β-core fragment concentrations up
to 500,000 pmol/L.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I and EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II are calibrated
against reference material traceable to WHO International Standard (IS) 5th edition (NIBSC code
07/364).

A detection limit study was performed using negative urine samples spiked with 0, 5, 6.5, 8,
9, 10, 15, and 25mIU/mL hCG (hCG traceable to the 5th WHO IS). The samples were tested
using both devices (EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I and EGENS Pregnancy Test
Midstream II) using both instream and dip testing sampling methods in replicates of 20 for
each of three lots of devices by 24 different operators (2 operators per lot per format and per
testing method). The device cut-off is 10 mIU/mL hCG.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The device cut-off is 10 mIU/mL. See Detection Limit (Section VII.A.6) and
Precision/Reproducibility (Section VII.A.1) sections above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Urine samples from women aged 21 to 48 years who were suspected of being pregnant were
collected. Approximately half of the women were suspected to be pregnant in the early stage
of less than 5 weeks. These samples were masked and randomized prior to testing by
professionals using the EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I, and EGENS Pregnancy Test
Midstream II, and the predicate device, in dip and simulated instream sampling methods).

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
2. Clinical Specificity:
Specificity study to determine the false-positive result rate
The clinical specificity of the EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I and EGENS Pregnancy
Test Midstream II was evaluated to determine the incidence of false positive tests results
from the candidate device. Urine samples from 100 healthy, non-pregnant female from each
of three cohorts: pre-menopausal (ages 18-40 years old), peri-menopausal (41-55 years old)
and post-menopausal (>55 years old) women (300 subjects total) were tested. The clinical
specificity was calculated as 300/300, or 100%. There was no difference between the two
sampling methods (dip and instream). The results are summarized in the tables below:

Detection of hCG in Early Pregnancy Clinical Samples
A total of 585 urine samples were collected from 65 pregnant women confirmed to be
pregnant by ultrasound. The women ranged from 21 to 40 years old and testing was
conducted starting from 8 days before the expected menstrual period to the day of the
expected menstrual period. Each sample was tested using both formats of the device. The
same results were observed for both devices and both sampling methods. The following is a

Urine samples were prepared at 5mIU/mL, 6.5mIU/mL, 8.0mIU/mL and 10mIU/mL hCG
concentrations by spiking hCG into negative pooled urine specimens. Each sample was
aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. These samples were tested by 200 lay
persons of varying educational and occupational backgrounds aged 21 to 50 years old using
either the EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream I or the EGENS Pregnancy Test Midstream II
devices in both dip and instream sampling methods. The testing was performed at 3 sites. The
results are summarized in the tables below (both dip and instream data combined). The data
