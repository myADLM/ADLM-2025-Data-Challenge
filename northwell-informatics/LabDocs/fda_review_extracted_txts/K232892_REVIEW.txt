For Prescription Use Only
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
An ELISA plate reader capable of reading absorbance at one or more of the following settings is
required but not provided: 450 nm, 450/620 nm, or 450/630 nm.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA is an enzyme immunoassay which detects the H. pylori
antigen in human fecal samples. The Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA comes in a kit that
contains materials to assay a total of 92 samples. The device consists of a 96-well clear flat
bottom polystyrene high bind microplate coated with affinity purified rabbit anti-human H.
pylori polyclonal antibody. The device is provided with detection antibody which is a purified
mouse monoclonal antibody specific for H. pylori antigen and has been conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The device kit is also provided with sample diluent buffer, wash
buffer, substrate solution, stop solution along with negative and positive controls. Negative
control is a phosphate buffered protein solution and positive control is composed of purified H.
pylori antigen (ATCC strain 43504) from cell lysate.
B Principle of Operation:
The Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA is an enzyme immunoassay which detects the H. pylori
antigen in human fecal samples. Polyclonal anti-H. pylori capture antibodies are immobilized on
microwells. Patient samples prepared in sample diluent are added to the microwells and
incubated for one hour at 37 ± 2°C. If the H. pylori antigen is present in the sample, it will bind
to the immobilized antibody on the plate. Following this incubation, the plate is washed
thoroughly. A peroxidase conjugated anti-H. pylori monoclonal antibody is then added to the
K232892 - Page 2 of 14

--- Page 3 ---
microwells and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 ± 2°C. If H. pylori antigen is bound to the
microwells in the first step, the detection antibody would now bind in this step to form a
sandwich complex. Following this incubation, a thorough wash step is performed to remove non-
specific and non-binding materials. Substrate is then added and incubated for 10 minutes at 37 ±
2°C to generate a color in the presence of the enzyme complex. Stop solution is then added to
end the reaction. The results are read spectrophotometrically at the following wavelengths:
1. Single Wavelength Measurement at 450 nm
2. Dual Wavelength Measurement 450/620 nm or 450/630 nm

C. Inclusivity:
A total of six (6) H. pylori strains (whole cells) and one purified H. pylori antigen were
evaluated for inclusivity study. Samples were prepared by diluting each strain (whole cells)
and antigen in negative stool matrix at the level of 1-3 × LoD (using LoD of 1.69 × 103
CFU/mL whole cells for strain ATCC 43504 and 5.86 ng/mL antigen for strain ATCC
49503). Samples were tested for reactivity in triplicate with the Hp Detect Stool Antigen
ELISA measuring by both dual (450/620 or 450/630 nm) and single wavelength (450 nm).
Results for inclusivity are shown in Table 5. All strains were detected with Hp Detect Stool

6. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Sample Stability – Contrived Specimens:
The sample stability for contrived specimens was evaluated for both refrigerated and frozen
storage conditions including freeze and thaw. Samples were prepared by spiking H.
pylori antigen (ATCC strain 43504) into a negative pooled fecal matrix. The sample panel
was made up of 10 members of H. pylori antigen concentrations ranging from 0.47 to 5.42 ×
LoD tested in triplicates. After establishing the baseline measurement (time zero), each of
the 10 panel members were aliquoted and stored at three storage conditions: 2°C to 8°C, ≤-
12°C, and ≤-60°C and tested for each time point and temperature range (shown in Table
6A). All the stability tests were measured in both dual (450/620 or 450/630 nm) and single
wavelength (450 nm) with equivalent results. Results shown in Table 6B, 6C, and 6D are for
10 panel sample members grouped into 3 high negatives (<1 × LoD), 4 low positives (1-2 ×
LoD), and 3 moderate positives (3-5 × LoD) measured in dual wavelengths.

The results demonstrated no change in the performance interpretation from time zero
throughout all the test points at each storage condition.
A freeze/thaw study was also conducted to evaluate the antigen stability after two (2) freeze-
thaw cycles. The freeze/thaw study used the same 10 panels members as described in the
specimen stability study. Following the baseline measurement (time zero) each sample was
frozen at ≤-12°C and ≤-60°C and tested after one (1) and two (2) freeze/thaw cycle
respectively. Test results demonstrate no change in the performance interpretation from time
zero throughout each of the two freeze-thaw cycles. The recommended storage conditions
for stool samples are summarized in Table 7.

The limit of detection (LoD) for the Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA was determined by
using antigens from two strains of H. pylori, ATCC43504 (Primary strain) and ATCC 49503
(Secondary strain). Detergent solubilized whole cell lysate of H. pylori was used to purify
antigens. For each strain, three positive sample panels were prepared by spiking purified H.
pylori antigen into a negative stool matrix. Each positive sample was then used to prepare its
initial series of six dilutions. For Strain ATCC 43504 additional four dilutions were made
(total 10 dilutions) and for Strain ATCC 43503 additional 5 dilutions were made (total 11
dilutions) to ensure that at least 3 dilutions are within 0.10 to 0.90 (10% to 90%) hit rate for
Probit analysis. To determine LoD, each dilution was tested in seven replicates across three
days producing 63 data points per dilution per strain (3 positive samples × 7 replicates × 3
days = 63 data points). Testing was conducted using two reagent lots and measuring by both
dual (450/620 or 450/630 nm) and single wavelength (450 nm). A Probit analysis was
performed to estimate LoD which is defined as the concentration of H. pylori antigen that
yields a positive result 95% of the time. LoD values determined for the Hp Detect Stool
Antigen ELISA test are shown in Table 9.
Table 9. LoD values for Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA
ATCC Strain ng/mL (95%CI) Quantity/Test
Strain 43504 2.53 (2.48 to 2.60) 0.38 ng
Strain 49503 5.86 (5.56 to 6.37) 0.88 ng
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA was established at
2.53 ng/mL (0.38 ng/test) for strain ATCC 43504 and 5.86 ng/mL (0.88 ng/test) for strain
ATCC 49503, measured in dual wavelength.
The correlation between antigen amount (ng/mL) and bacterial count (CFU/mL) was
established for strain ATCC 43504 by dermining the LoD in bacterial count (CFU/mL). The
LoD of bacterial concentration determined for H. pylori Strain ATCC 43504 is 1.69 × 103
CFU/mL. Therefore, H. pylori strain ATCC 43504 has a LoD of 2.53 ng/mL of antigen
concentration correlates to a LoD of 1.69 × 103 CFU/mL of bacteria concentration when
compared to side to side (data not shown).
The study to determine LoD for the Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA is acceptable and these
values (in CFU/mL and ng/mL) were used to guide the analytical studies as appropriate.
Prozone / Hook Effect
To ensure that a high concentration of H. pylori antigen does not interfere with a positive
reaction in the Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA, a high positive sample was prepared by
spiking H. pylori antigen (ATCC strain 43504) into negative fecal matrix. The sample was
serially diluted at concentrations ranging from 20,000 ng/mL to 0.25 ng/mL. Each of the
serial dilutions were tested in 8 replicates measuring by both dual (450/620 or 450/630 nm)
and single wavelength (450 nm) settings. Positive and negative controls were included in
each run. The reading value of the plate reader reached to maximum level at 800 ng/ml of H.
pylori antigen and remained at maximum level up to 20,000 ng/ml. No high-dose hook effect
was observed for the assay at antigen concentrations of up to 20,000 ng/mL.

8. Assay Cut-Off:
Assay cut-off for Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA was determined for both spectrophotometric
measurement of Dual Wavelength (450/620 nm or 450/630 nm) and Single Wavelength (450
nm). A panel of 227 specimens, of which 83 were positive and 144 were negative by the
predicate device were evaluated with the Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed and the cut-off values for spectrophotometric
single and dual wavelength reading methods were selected to achieve optimum diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity:
Spectrophotometric Dual Wavelength (450/620 nm or 450/630 nm)
Negative: <0.100
Positive: ≥0.100
Spectrophotometric Single Wavelength (450 nm)
Negative: <0.140
Positive: ≥0.140
A positive result indicates that H. pylori antigens were detected. A negative result indicates
that no H. pylori antigens were detected, or that the antigen levels are below what can be
detected by the assay.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Performance - Frozen Specimens:
The performance of the Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA for frozen specimens was evaluated
by using method comparison study with an FDA cleared device. A total of 433 frozen and
de-identified fecal samples were tested in which 355 specimens were collected from Italy and
78 specimens collected from three geographically different regions of the USA. The clinical
specimens were collected from the patients presenting with dyspepsia, and would be
undergoing a routine endoscopy and biopsy, not on antibiotics, bismuth, or proton-pump
inhibitors, and those excluded if they had been treated for H. pylori withing the past 6
months. Specimens were distributed into three testing sites located within the USA which
include two external sites and one internal (Biomerica) site. Results were evaluated by
reading absorbance at dual wavelength (450/620 or 450/630 nm) and single wavelength (450
nm). The performance and statistics are shown in Table 10 for dual wavelength and Table 11
for single wavelength.

2. Clinical Performance - Fresh Specimens
The performance of the Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA for fresh specimens (never frozen)
was evaluated by using method comparison study with an FDA cleared device. A total of 142
fresh, de-identified, fecal specimens from patients with physician’s medical evaluation for
symptoms of H. pylori infection were collected through multiple biospecimen vendor and
clinical laboratories. The specimens were tested in the collection centers with the comparator
device and specimen aliquots were shipped to Biomerica (internal site) and tested using Hp
Detect Stool Antigen ELISA using both dual wavelength (450/620 or 450/630 nm) and single
wavelength (450 nm) settings.

The Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA demonstrated the clinical performance of 100% positive
percent agreement and 98.4% negative percent agreement for fresh stool specimens using
both dual and single wavelength configurations. The performance results for fresh specimen
clinical study are acceptable.
3. Post-Therapy Performance
The performance of the Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA for post-therapy diagnosis was
evaluated by using 14 paired (pre-and post- therapy) retrospective specimens from Italy. All
subjects initially tested positive for H. pylori by composite reference method (CRM)
consisting of histology and Rapid Urease Test and all completed eradication therapy. Post-
therapy fecal samples were collected at a minimum of 4 weeks post completion of
eradication therapy. All 14 pre-therapy samples were shown to be positive and matched with
the CRM diagnosis. The result for post-therapy was show in Table 13.

Total 10 4 14
Statistics Performance 95% Confidence Interval
Sensitivity 100% 72.25 – 100 %
Specificity 100 % 51.02 – 100 %
The results for post-therapy performance show that the Hp Detect Stool Antigen ELISA
exhibited a 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity when compared to the composite reference
method. The performance results for post-therapy study are acceptable and support the claim
for the test to be used in assessing H. pylori status after treatment.
