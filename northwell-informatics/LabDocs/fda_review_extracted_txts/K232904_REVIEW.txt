B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access Ostase assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for use
with the Access Immunoassay Systems for the quantitative measurement of bone alkaline
phosphatase (BAP), an indicator of osteoblastic activity, in human serum and plasma. This
device is intended to be used as an aid in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis and
Paget's disease.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The chemiluminescent substrate was modified on the Access Ostase assay from the Access
Substrate to the Lumi-Phos PRO substrate.
The Access Ostase reagent pack consists of two specific reagents, R1a, and R1b. A summary
description of the reagents is provided below:
Well Contents Ingredients
R1a: 3.25 mL Paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-mouse polyclonal
antibody suspended in TRIS-buffered saline, with surfactant, bovine
serum albumin (BSA), protein (goat), < 0.1% sodium azide, and
0.1% ProClin 300.
R1b: 1.2 mL Anti-BAP mouse monoclonal antibody diluted in TRIS-buffered
saline, with surfactant, BSA, < 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.1% ProClin
300.
Materials needed but not supplied with the reagent kit include the Access Ostase assay
Calibrators, Quality Control (QC) materials, Lumi-Phos PRO, UniCel DxI Wash Buffer II, and
Sample Diluent.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access Ostase assay is a one-step sandwich immunoenzymatic assay. A mouse monoclonal
antibody specific to BAP is added to a reaction vessel with paramagnetic particles coated with
goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody. 30 µL of calibrators, controls, or samples containing BAP
are added to the coated particles, and bind to the anti-BAP monoclonal antibody.
After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light

proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically
determined from a stored calibration.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Studies were performed to determine the imprecision of the candidate device using a protocol
based on the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline.
The study was run on three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers using three reagent
lots, and three calibrator lots. Pooled serum samples were tested in duplicates across two runs
per day, over 20 days. Within-run (repeatability), between run, between day, and within-lab
(total) precision results for a representative reagent lot on a single instrument are summarized
below:
Concentration (µg/L) Repeatability Between-Run Between-Day Within-lab
(Within-run) (Total)
Sample N Mean SD % CV SD % CV SD % CV SD % CV
Sample 1 80 1.8 0.1 4.6 0.01 0.8 0.0001 0.0 0.1 4.7
Sample 2 80 9.1 0.3 3.3 0.2 2.0 0.2 1.7 0.4 4.1
Sample 3 80 25 0.8 3.3 0.6 2.3 0.5 1.8 1.1 4.4
Sample 4 80 38 1.4 3.6 0.8 2.1 0.4 1.0 1.6 4.3
Sample 5 80 98 3.2 3.3 2.3 2.4 0.9 0.9 4.1 4.2
2. Linearity:
Studies were performed using serum samples across the assay measuring range to evaluate
the linearity of the Access Ostase assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer in
accordance with the CLSI EP06-2nd Edition guideline. The data was analyzed using a
weighted linear regression model.
The results of these linearity studies support that the Access Ostase assay is linear on the DxI
9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer throughout the proposed measuring range of 0.3-120
µg/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference was reviewed in K994278.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See Linearity section VII A.2 above.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability was reviewed in K994278.
6. Detection Limit:
Studies were performed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD),
and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) using protocols based on the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. The
LoB was determined to be 0.003 µg/L. The LoD was determined to be 0.007 µg/L. The LoQ
was determined to be 0.3 µg/L based on a 20% CV performance goal.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted comparing the candidate device to the predicate
device using a protocol based on the CLSI EP09c-A3 guideline. A total of one hundred and
sixty-three (163) serum samples (153 were individual native serum, and 10 samples were
native serum spiked with BAP) were evaluated in the method comparison study.
The study was run on three DxI 9000 instruments and three Access 2 instruments with three
reagent pack lots and three calibrator lots.
The comparison between paired measurements was analyzed by fitting the observed Access
Ostase Assay on the DxI 9000 instrument (dependent variable, y) into a Passing-Bablok
regression model, with the observed Access Ostase Assay on Access 2 values as the only
independent variable (x, predicate). The results are shown below:
