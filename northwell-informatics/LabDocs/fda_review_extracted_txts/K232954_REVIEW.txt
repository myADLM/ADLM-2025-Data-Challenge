identification of specific viral and bacterial nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection and/or pharyngitis are indicative of the presence of the
identified microorganism and aids in diagnosis if used in conjunction with other clinical and
epidemiological information, and laboratory findings. The results of this test should not be used
as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.
Negative results in the setting of a respiratory illness and/or pharyngitis may be due to infection
with pathogens that are not detected by this test, or a respiratory tract infection that may not be
detected by an NPS or TS specimen. Positive results do not rule out coinfection with other

Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Respiratory/Sore Throat (R/ST) Panel is a multiplexed nucleic acid-
amplification-based test that is intended to detect and identify multiple respiratory viral and
bacterial pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and throat swabs (TS) from individuals with
signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection or pharyngitis, respectively. The BIOFIRE
SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel is performed using the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System, which is an
automated polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based in vitro diagnostic instrument system for use
with reagent pouches for specific indications.
The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System automates nucleic acid extraction and nested multiplex PCR
in closed system. The resulting PCR products are evaluated using assay-specific DNA melting
analysis. The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Systems Software executes the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST
Panel test according to parameters specified in the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel Software.
The same protocol is used for sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription
(RT)-PCR amplification and analysis for both NPS and TS specimens but with different result
reporting according to the specimen type selected. The sample is added to the reagent pouch and
the pouch is loaded into the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System, after which results are reported in
approximately 15 minutes without further user intervention.
The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System is comprised of between one and four modules that are
connected to a single SPOTFIRE Control Station equipped with the SPOTFIRE System
Software. The first module is placed on top of the Control Station and up to three additional
modules may be stacked on top as required. Each module can be accessed at random to perform
a test, independent of the other modules attached to the same Control Station.
The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel Reagent Kit includes the following components:
• BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel Pouches (30 ea.)
Each packed under vacuum in a metal canister and outer bag
o
• BIOFIRE Sample Preparation Reagent Kit (SPRK) (32 ea.)
Fixed volume transfer pipette for addition of the test sample to the Sample
o
Injection Vial

rehydration.
B Principle of Operation:
The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Panel Pouch is a closed-system disposable that contains all the
reagents needed for sample preparation, reverse transcription, PCR amplification and fluorescent
detection, including melt curve analysis of amplified products. The rigid plastic “fitment” of the
pouch contains reagents in freeze-dried form while the flexible plastic portion of the pouch is
divided into discrete “blisters” in which different chemical processes are carried out. After
sample collection, the user adds the sample to the Panel Pouch, selects the applicable specimen
type from the SPOTFIRE System touchscreen and then places the pouch into the instrument to
start the run. All other operations are automated.
The SPOTFIRE Systems Software is designed to run on the SPOTFIRE Control Station that
consists of an integrated computer and touchscreen. The SPOTFIRE Systems Software interfaces
with the user via the touchscreen to operate the instrument, collect, save, analyze and retrieve
data, report test results and view stored information. The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel
Software works with the Systems Software and specifies the assay-specific parameters to
perform the test, interpret the data and display the reported results.
To perform a test with the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel, the patient sample is first mixed
with a denaturing Sample Buffer to inactivate nucleases. The user then loads the diluted sample
into the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel Pouch via the injection port. The vacuum in the pouch
draws the liquid into the sample well of the pouch fitment and in the process rehydrates the cell-
based Process Control. Upon inserting into the instrument, the sample mixture is moved to the
lysis blister where mechanical agitation with zirconia-silica beads is used to complete cell lysis.
The lysate is then mixed with glass-coated magnetic beads which adsorb the nucleic acids
liberated in the lysis step. The extracted nucleic acids are washed to remove potential inhibitors
and then eluted into buffer that is used to rehydrate the contents of the first stage PCR blister,
which includes all the components needed for reverse transcription (RT) and first stage PCR.
RT-PCR is initiated upon achievement of the requisite temperature within the amplification
chamber. After completion of first-stage amplification, the products of the reaction are diluted
and combined with fresh reagents that are distributed over a second stage PCR array. The second
stage primers are internal (“nested”) with respect to the first stage primers and each analyte or
control target is represented by three discrete amplification reactions. The second stage PCR
array includes an assay control, the PCR2 Control, failure of which indicates a failure in the
second stage PCR and invalidates the run.
Included in the PCR master mix for the second stage PCR is a fluorescent dye (LC Green Plus)
that is specific for double-stranded DNA. The dye intercalates with the double stranded-PCR
products and fluoresces at a specific wavelength that is detected by the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE
System. At the end of the second stage PCR, the temperature of the array is gradually raised at a
controlled ramp rate and the fluorescence is monitored. Fluorescence decreases at the melting
temperature of the amplicons, and the temperature at which this occurs is characteristic of each
amplification product. The Panel Software automatically evaluates the calculated melting
temperature (Tm) in comparison to the predefined range for each specific analyte. The results
K232954 - Page 5 of 75

--- Page 6 ---
from each of the three amplification reactions for each analyte are combined by the software to
determine the final test result. For an assay to be called positive, at least two of the three wells
must have a PCR product with a Tm that is within the specified range for that analyte. Assays
that do not meet these criteria are reported as negative.
Positive and negative results for the assay controls (Process Control and PCR2 Control) are
compared to their expected values and assigned a “pass” or “fail” result. Panel-specific rules
define how control failures affect interpretation of test results. For the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE
R/ST Panel, failure of either the RNA Process Control or PCR2 Control invalidates the results
for all analytes. The final sample result is determined by the interpretation rules defined in the
Panel Software.
For most bacteria and viruses detected by the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel, a “positive”
result is reported if two or more of the wells corresponding to a single assay contain detectable
PCR product of the appropriate Tm. However, to ensure inclusivity, certain analytes are targeted
by multiple assays, the results of which are interpreted in combination, as described below in
Tables 1 and 2.

3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Use of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel requires collection of either a nasopharyngeal
swab (NPS) or throat swab (TS) according to standard procedures. Nasopharyngeal swabs
should be placed in 1-3 mL of viral transport medium, while throat swabs should be placed in
1 mL liquid Amies Medium. The minimum sample volume required to perform a test is 300
µL. Specimens should be tested as soon as possible following collection but may be stored
for up to 4 hours at room temperature (15-25 °C) or for up to 3 days at 2-8 °C or up to 30
days at ≤ -15 °C.
The SPOTFIRE System Software includes step-by-step on-screen instructions that guide the
user through the process of starting a run on the instrument. After cleaning the work area and
Pouch Loading Station, the user removes a BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R /ST Panel pouch from its
vacuum packaging and places it into the Pouch Loading Station. They then hydrate the pouch
using the Hydration Injection Vial by injecting the contents through the Hydration Solution
Injection Port and transfer a fixed volume of sample to the Sample Injection Vial, together
with the entire contents of the Sample Buffer ampoule. After mixing the Sample Injection
Vial by inversion, the user injects the mixture into the pouch via the Sample Injection Port,
enters the sample identity into the instrument (manually or using the barcode scanner),
selects the applicable specimen type (NPS or TS) and initiates the run by inserting the pouch
into the instrument. The test will then proceed to completion, including interpretation of
results, without further user intervention.
4. Calibration:
The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System is factory calibrated. User calibration is not required.
5. Quality Control:
Internal Controls
Two process controls are included in each BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel pouch:
1) RNA Process Control
The RNA Process Control comprises freeze-dried Schizosaccharomyces pombe which
is rehydrated when the sample is loaded. The control material is carried through all
stages of the test process, including nucleic acid extraction and purification, reverse
transcription, first and second stage PCR amplification and DNA melt analysis. A
positive result indicates that all process steps carried out in the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE
R/ST Panel pouch were completed successfully.
2) PCR2 Control
The PCR2 control comprises a DNA target sequence that is dried into specific wells
used for the second stage amplification and melting curve analysis. A positive result
indicates that these processes were successful.
A positive result is required for both the RNA Process Control and the PCR2 Control for the
results for an individual pouch to be considered valid. If either control fails, the sample
should be retested using a new pouch.
K232954 - Page 8 of 75

--- Page 9 ---
External Controls
BioFire Diagnostics recommends routine testing of External Positive and Negative Controls
that are commercially available from bioMérieux or Maine Molecular Quality Controls, Inc.:
• SPOTFIRE RSP Positive Control (M42638)
• SPOTFIRE RSP Negative Control (M42738)
These controls are designed to monitor the performance of each of the individual assays
within the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel and should be tested as Quality Controls in
accordance with their FDA-cleared Instructions For Use (K233611) and the labeling for the
BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel.
In general, External Controls should be tested when training a new operator, or whenever a
new shipment of BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Panels or a new SPOTFIRE Control Station is
received. Additional Negative Controls should also be run at least monthly in each testing
location to monitor for environmental contamination.
A total of 351 External Positive and Negative Controls were tested during the Prospective
Clinical Study described in Section VII (C). Of these, 11 were associated with instrument
errors or internal control failures and 24 were tested using an incorrect or expired reagent
pouch. As a result, there were 316 External Controls with valid results (141 Positive and 175
Negative), including 4 (1.3%) that were incorrectly designated by the operator as patient
samples, rather than control materials. Of the 141 valid External Positive Controls, 98.6%
(139/141) returned the expected results for all analytes as did all 175 (100%) of the valid
Negative External Controls.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility and precision of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel on different
BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Systems was evaluated with multiple operators who tested positive and
negative samples over multiple days at three study sites, in addition to BioFire Diagnostics.
All analytes detected by the panel were evaluated using contrived positive specimens at
concentrations equivalent to ≤ 3X their respective analytical limit of detection (LoD) (Table
3). Negative samples were prepared using artificial matrix only.

At BioFire Diagnostics, testing was performed on three BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Systems, using
three lots of reagents over five consecutive days. On each day of testing, two operators each
tested three replicates of each sample (one per reagent lot) on each BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE
System for a total of 90 replicates per sample overall (2 operators x 3 samples x 3
instruments x 5 days = 90 replicates).
At the external study sites, testing was performed with a single BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System
at each site and occurred over five non-consecutive days using a single lot of reagents that
was common across each of the sites. On each day, two operators each tested two replicates
of each sample for a total of 60 replicates per sample overall (2 operators x 2 samples x 3
sites x 5 days = 60 replicates).
For each analyte there were 150 positive and 600 negative samples. Samples that produced
an invalid result on initial testing due to process control failure (n = 12) or instrument error (n
= 2) were retested. Precision and reproducibility for each analyte were calculated by
assessing the agreement between the reported test results and the expected results for each
sample.
A summary of the results of the study, stratified by analyte and BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE
System/site is provided in Table 4. Positive agreement for all analytes was > 95% and there
was negligible difference between systems, sites, reagent lots or operators. Negative
agreement was 100% in all cases.

1 1 positive sample was initially reported as Positive: Influenza A Virus (No Subtype Identified) and was therefore retested. The
retest result was as expected. The retest results from this sample for each analyte are included in the summary table.
2 2 positive samples were initially reported as Positive: Influenza A Virus (No Subtype Identified) and 1 positive sample was
initially reported as Uncertain: Influenza A Virus. All 3 samples were retested and the retest results were as expected. The
retest results from these samples for each analyte are included in the summary table.
3 1 sample was reported as Uncertain Influenza A Virus but was not retested.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Specificity (Exclusivity)
The analytical specificity (exclusivity) of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel was
evaluated through a combination of in silico analysis and laboratory testing of on- and off-
panel species, phylogenetically related viruses and bacteria and other microorganisms that
may be found in the respiratory tract.
In silico Analysis
In silico analysis of assay specificity/exclusivity was performed by conducting searches
with whole amplicon and paired inner primer sequences using the NCBI Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) “blastn” tool. The location and orientation of regions of

homology with the primer sequences were evaluated to determine the potential for
amplification. A summary of the results from the analysis is provided in Table 5. The
BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST panel assays were shown to be specific for their respective
analytes with the following exceptions, which are noted in the device labeling:
• Cross-reaction of the SARS-CoV-2 assays with closely-related bat and pangolin
coronavirus sequences
• Cross-reaction of the Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus assay with B. pertussis, B.
parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica
• Cross-reaction of the B. parapertussis assay with strains of B. bronchiseptica that
carry IS1001

1 Some zoonotic coronaviruses may cross-react but these are not expected to be found in human clinical specimens.
2 A sequence from Protopolystoma xenopodis (a parasitic worm found in frogs) exhibited significant homology to
the pan-influenza A PCR primers but is not expected to be found in human clinical specimens.
Laboratory Testing of Analytical Specificity
The analytical specificity (exclusivity) of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel was also
evaluated by testing high concentrations of on- and off-panel viruses, bacteria and other
microorganisms that are phylogenetically related or may be found in nasopharyngeal and/or
throat swab specimens. Analysis of on-panel analytes was performed to evaluate the potential

for intra-panel cross-reactivity (i.e., detection of an analyte by an assay other than the target-
specific assay for that analyte). Analysis of off-panel analytes was performed to evaluate the
potential for cross-reaction with other respiratory flora that are not intended to be detected by
the panel. Each on-panel species was tested in triplicate and the results are shown in Tables 6
and 7. The expected results were obtained with each on-panel virus and no cross-reaction
was observed (Table 6). Based on in silico analysis, it was predicted that B. parapertussis
and B. pertussis would produce positive results with the Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus
assay. B. pertussis produced false-positive results at 1.3 x 1010 CFU/mL but was reported
negative when tested at 1.3 x 109 CFU/mL (Table 7). False-positive results for Human
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus were not observed with B. parapertussis at the concentration tested
(4.6 x 109 CFU/mL). However, the potential for cross-reaction of the human
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus assay with both B. parapertussis and B. pertussis based on the in
silico prediction is noted in the device labeling.

1 In silico analysis predicted detection by the Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus assay but none was observed.
2 Cross-reaction predicted by in silico analysis and confirmed by laboratory testing at ≥ 1.3 x 1010 CFU/mL.
The potential for cross-reaction with off-panel analytes was evaluated by testing 87 strains of
bacteria, 2 species of yeast and 7 viruses that are either phylogenetically related to the on-
panel analytes or which are commonly found in the respiratory tract (Table 8). Included in
the study were isolates of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis of animal origin and S.
dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, both of which lack the region of the S. dysgalactiae
genome targeted by the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel. No cross-reaction was observed
other than the expected detection of one strain of B. bronchiseptica by the assay for B.
parapertussis.

1 B. bronchiseptica NRRL B-59909 carries IS1001 which is the target for the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel B. parapertussis
assay. Positive results were obtained with all target levels ≥ 28 cells/mL and with 1/3 replicates at 2.8 cells/mL.
2 The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel assay for S. dysgalactiae is intended to detect strains of S. dysgalactiae subsp.
equisimilis of human origin. Detection of S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae or strains of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis of
non-human origin is not expected.
Based on a combination of the in silico and laboratory testing data, the potential for cross-
reaction of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel with certain on- and off-panel analytes is
noted in the device labeling, as summarized in Table 9.

Interference Testing
A study was conducted to evaluate the potential for assay interference due to the presence of
endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in upper respiratory specimens. In
addition, testing was also performed with representative on- and off-panel microorganisms at
very high concentrations to evaluate the potential for competitive interference between
analytes on the BIOFIRE SPORFIRE R/ST Panel. Testing of each potentially interfering
substance/microorganism was performed using contrived positive and negative specimens
prepared in artificial throat swab matrix. The positive specimens contained representative on-
panel analytes at levels close to their respective LoD (Table 10). In a separate study (refer to
Sections VII (A)(6) and (B)(2), below) the analytical sensitivity of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE
R/ST Panel was shown to be similar, irrespective of the specimen matrix (nasopharyngeal or
throat swab) and therefore it was considered acceptable to use just one of the two matrices
for the evaluation of assay interference. The concentration of each substance tested was
chosen to represent a high level that may be found in natural clinical specimens. The results
of the study are summarized in Tables 11-16.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Specimen Stability
Nasopharyngeal Swabs
Analytical studies to demonstrate the stability of the applicable BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST
Panel analytes in nasopharyngeal swab matrix in viral transport medium are documented
under K213954. The data support the claimed storage conditions for nasopharyngeal swabs
for use with the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel of up to 4 hours at 15-25 °C, 3 days at 2-8
°C or 30 days at ≤ -15 °C.
Throat Swabs
An additional study was conducted to support use of liquid Amies medium for transport and
storage of throat swabs for testing with the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel. Natural throat
swab matrix in Amies medium was obtained from asymptomatic volunteers and was spiked
with representative target analytes from the Sore Throat Panel at a concentration of 3X LoD
and tested either immediately (baseline) or after storage under different conditions. Five
different mixtures of target analytes were included in the study. Each was tested 10 times at
each time point after storage under the applicable condition. The results are summarized in
Table 17. All the analytes were shown to be stable under the conditions tested. The results of
this study support the stability of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel analytes in throat
swab specimens in liquid Amies medium for up to 4 hours at 25 °C, 3 days at 2-8 °C or 30
days at ≤ -15 °C prior to testing.

1 Coronavirus NL63 and Parainfluenza Virus 1 were included as the representative analytes for the Coronavirus (seasonal) and
Parainfluenza Virus assays, respectively.
Reagent Stability
Reagent shelf-life was established in a Real-time Reagent Stability Study using 3 lots of
reagent kits that were stored at 23 ± 2°C, corresponding to the upper end of the
recommended storage temperature range (15-25 °C). At each test point, pouch performance
was evaluated using a synthetic RNA mixture that contained the targets for each of the
analytes on the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel, as well as with negative samples.
Additional testing was also performed at selected time points with a representative panel of
quantified viral and bacterial species to evaluate the effectiveness of nucleic acid extraction
and recovery. Testing of reagents exposed to simulated shipping conditions and to verify
performance under the specified in-use workflow parameters was also conducted. To-date,
the results of these studies support a shelf-life for the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel kit
from the date of manufacture of 9 months when stored under the recommended conditions.
6. Detection Limit:
Analytical Sensitivity
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for each analyte on the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel was
determined with samples prepared in Viral Transport Medium and/or liquid Amies Medium
(as applicable) containing artificial clinical matrix. A study showing that the formulation of
the artificial matrix neither enhanced nor impaired assay performance is described in Section
VII (B)(2). The identity and concentration of each viral or bacterial stock used in the study
was either certified by the commercial supplier or confirmed by quantitative real-time or

digital PCR and standard methods. An initial titration of each viral or bacterial stock was
performed to estimate the LoD, which was then confirmed by testing 20 replicates at the
estimated LoD concentration and at one 10-fold lower dilution. The LoD was considered
confirmed if ≥ 19/20 replicates at the estimated LoD concentration and ≤ 18/20 replicates at a
10-fold lower concentration were reported as Positive. For most analytes, the confirmed LoD
was the same with samples prepared in both types of transport medium (Table 18).

For efficiency, the LoD study was conducted by co-spiking multiple analytes into each
sample. Therefore, additional testing was performed using a representative subset of target
analytes to determine whether testing of multiple species in the same reaction had any effect
test performance. Samples containing a single analyte were tested in replicates of 6 in
parallel with samples containing the same analyte in addition to other viruses/bacteria on the
BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel. Overall, the results of the study showed that there was
negligible difference in the analytical sensitivity of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel
with individual (single) or multiple target analytes in a sample (Tables 19 and 20).

Inclusivity (Analytical Reactivity)
The inclusivity of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel was evaluated using a combination of in
silico analysis of publicly available sequence information and laboratory testing of contrived
specimens containing viral and bacterial isolates that were selected to represent phylogenetic,
geographic and temporal diversity.
In silico Analysis of Inclusivity
BLAST searches were conducted to obtain all available gene target sequences for each assay
within the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel. In silico analysis of the inclusivity of the panel
was performed using concatenated alignments of the nested primer sets for each target
region. Mismatches to the primers were evaluated for their potential to affect detection of the
target analyte based on their number and location within each primer sequence. In silico
analysis of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel primers showed that the target sequences
are generally well conserved and that the assays are predicted to be robust to known
mutations in these regions, with the ability to detect all or nearly all isolates of the targeted
analytes.
In silico analysis of the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 was performed using all available
sequences in the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data) database as of
December 31, 2023. Included in the analysis were 13,682,523 sequences of which ≥ 99.99%

were predicted to be detected by one or both SARS-CoV-2 assays within the BIOFIRE
SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel, including sequences of all lineages, Variants of Concern and
Variants Under Investigation identified to-date. Impaired sensitivity for detection by both
SARS-CoV-2 assays was predicted for < 0.006% of sequences evaluated (824/13,682,523).
Laboratory Testing of Inclusivity
Contrived samples containing individual viruses and bacteria were prepared at approximately
3X LoD in liquid Amies medium containing artificial throat swab matrix and tested in
triplicate (unless noted in the tables below). The analytical sensitivity of the BIOFIRE
SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel was shown to be similar with artificial throat swab and
nasopharyngeal matrices (refer to Table 18, above) and therefore use of artificial throat swab
matrix as the representative matrix for analysis of inclusivity was considered acceptable.
All the viral and bacterial isolates tested were successfully detected apart from one strain of
S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis of animal origin and one strain of S. pyogenes that are both
known to lack the respective regions of the bacterial genome targeted by the BIOFIRE
SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel (Tables 21-36). The inability of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST
Panel to detect strains of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis of animal origin and potential for
false-negative results due to deletion of the target region in some strains of S. pyogenes are
noted as Limitations in the device labeling.

3 Reported as Negative at up to 100,000 copies/mL due to a deletion of the target region. This isolate is from an animal source
(horse), all other isolates of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis tested were of human origin. BIOFIRE has determined that
animal isolates of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis generally lack the region of the genome targeted by the BIOFIRE
SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel. Additional animal isolates of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis were tested as part of the Cross-
reactivity Study as described in Section VII (A)(3) and none were detected. The labeling for the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST
Panel indicates that the assay detects isolates of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis of human but not animal origin.

R/ST Panel. The Melt Detector software analyzes each well of the second stage PCR array
independently. A series of mathematical tests is applied to each fluorescence curve to
discriminate target-specific amplicon from system noise and non-specific amplification
products, accounting for both system variation and known sequence variation within the
amplified regions targeted by the assay. The Melt Detector algorithm was developed by
tuning against a large data set comprised of both typical and atypical melt curves that were
assigned as positive or negative by manual review performed by expert users. The tuning
process optimized the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm in comparison to manual
result interpretation and included optimization of the order of procedural steps and the
respective threshold for each parameter.

For each assay within the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel, the expected melting
temperature (mean Tm) was determined empirically using the most common sequence
variants. The acceptable range around the mean was then determined through a combination
of empirical testing of known sequence variants and mathematical modeling. Reference data
obtained from analysis of templates with known sequences were used to estimate additional
sources of system variability, including the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE instrument and reagents.
The melt range parameters for each analyte were validated in the subsequent Analytical and
Clinical Studies.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Refer to Section VII (C) Clinical Studies.
9. Carry-Over:
The potential for sample-to-sample cross-contamination during operation of the BIOFIRE
SPOTFIRE System was evaluated by testing an alternating series of positive and negative
contrived samples using the same Pouch Loading Station. The positive samples comprised
high levels of representative on-panel analytes spiked separately into artificial throat swab or
artificial nasopharyngeal swab matrix (n = 5 per representative analyte). Negative samples
comprised artificial matrix alone (n = 21). The expected positive results were obtained from
pouches containing the target analytes at high target levels. No false-positive results were
obtained from these pouches for any other analytes and all true negative samples that
contained none of the target analytes produced the expected negative results. These results
demonstrated that there is an acceptable, low likelihood of cross-contamination between
samples when the SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel is performed according to the instructions for use.

Not applicable.
2. Matrix Comparison:
Artificial vs Natural Matrix
The BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel is intended to detect multiple viral and bacterial
analytes in nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens. The high frequency of positive
samples for at least one analyte makes it impractical to use natural clinical matrices for
analytical validation studies for which large volumes of negative matrix are required. To
address this, artificial nasopharyngeal and throat swab matrices were used for most of the
analytical studies and therefore additional testing was conducted to demonstrate that the
analytical sensitivity of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel was similar with samples
prepared in artificial and natural specimen matrices, as described below.
Artificial nasopharyngeal swab and artificial throat swab matrices were comprised of
glycerol, porcine mucin, human whole blood, phosphate buffered saline and saline diluted in
transport medium (Viral Transport Medium [VTM] for nasopharyngeal swab or liquid Amies
medium for throat swab matrices, respectively). Testing was performed using a
representative subset of analytes targeted by the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel, including
DNA and RNA viruses and one Gram positive bacterial species. Ten-fold serial dilutions of 6
representative species were prepared in the artificial matrices and, in parallel, in the
respective natural clinical matrices obtained from asymptomatic donors. Prior to conducting
the study, the natural clinical specimens were tested using the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST
Panel to verify that none of the on-panel analytes were present. A summary of the results is
presented in Table 38.
Positive results were obtained for all replicates with all 6 analytes when tested at target levels
close to (≤ ~3X) the claimed LoD in the applicable artificial and natural matrices. The same
was true to the comparison of natural and artificial nasopharyngeal swab matrices, except for
Adenovirus B for which only 4/6 replicates (67%) in natural clinical matrix were reported
positive at the claimed LoD concentration. However, amplification curve characteristics were
similar between positive replicates in both the artificial and natural nasopharyngeal swab
matrices at the LoD target level and all replicates in both matrices were positive at a 10-fold
higher concentration, indicating that the analytical sensitivity in both matrices was similar.
Overall, the results of the matrix equivalency study showed that the use of artificial
nasopharyngeal or throat swab matrix does not enhance or impair device performance and is
acceptable for analytical studies in lieu of natural clinical matrix.

Fresh vs Frozen Samples
Because evaluation of the clinical performance of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel
required testing of archived frozen samples, a study was conducted to determine whether
freezing and thawing of throat swab specimens would affect detection of representative target
analytes. A similar study was previously performed with nasopharyngeal swab matrix under
K160068 for the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel and showed no adverse effects from
freezing and thawing of specimens.
Contrived throat swab specimens were prepared by co-spiking representative target analytes
into natural throat swab matrix in Amies medium that was known to be negative for the
species under investigation. Half the contrived specimens were prepared at 2X LoD, and the
remainder were spiked at levels ranging from 10 to 1,000X LoD (except for Influenza A H3

In combination, the above results indicate that the integrity of throat swab specimens for use
with the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel is unlikely to be affected by a single freeze-thaw
cycle.
Based on the above information, use of frozen nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens to
evaluate the performance of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel was considered
acceptable.
Transport Media Equivalency
The compatibility of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel with specimens collected in
alternative transport media (0.9% normal saline, Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco), BD
Universal Viral Transport (UVT) medium (BD Medical) and Remel MicroTest M4RT
(Thermo Fisher) was demonstrated under K213954. Because the reagent formulations and
workflow parameters for the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R and R/ST Panels are the same, these
data also support the compatibility of these alternative transport media with the SPOTFIRE
R/ST Panel.

Prospectively Collected Specimens
A Clinical Study with prospectively collected specimens was conducted at six sites (5 U.S.
and 1 ex-U.S.), including adult and pediatric emergency departments/urgent care centers, that
were considered representative of the intended use settings for the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE
System and BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel. The specimens included in the study were
either collected under Informed Consent or with parental permission and individual assent (if
appropriate) for minors < 18 years of age or were leftover (residual) samples from standard
of care testing. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study are summarized in Table
41. Specimen enrollment took place over two periods: both nasopharyngeal and throat swab
specimens were enrolled between December 2020 and September 2021 and enrollment of
throat swab specimens was continued from September 2022 to May 2023.

“Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not
Individually Identifiable” (April 2006).
4 None of the specimens enrolled in the study were collected in saline. According to the device labeling, saline is not a
recommended transport medium for use with the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel.
Aliquots of each specimen were prepared for testing with the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST
Panel and the applicable comparator method(s). Bacterial culture for β-hemolytic
streptococci was performed from a fresh aliquot of each throat swab specimen. All other
aliquots of nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens for comparator testing were stored at -
70 °C and shipped to BioFire Diagnostics for testing. At five of the study sites, specimen
enrollment began prior to the availability of BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Systems. During this

Initial enrollment in the Prospective Clinical Study included 1215 nasopharyngeal and 1165
throat swabs. Of these, 95 nasopharyngeal swabs and 288 throat swabs were excluded from
the analysis of performance for the reasons listed in Table 43. In addition, some specimens
were excluded from the analysis of performance for one or more specific analytes due to
failure to obtain a valid comparator result. All nasopharyngeal swabs included in the analysis

Archived Specimens
Several analytes included on the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel were not encountered
during the Prospective Clinical Study in sufficient numbers to demonstrate system
performance. Therefore, the Prospective Clinical Study was supported by additional testing
that was performed at four of the U.S. study sites on frozen, archived specimens obtained
from various clinical laboratories from around the world. These specimens were selected for
inclusion in the study based on their microbial content as originally determined by the source
laboratory and were stored frozen prior to testing. The microbial content of the archived
specimens was confirmed using the same molecular comparator methods as for the

prospectively collected specimens (Table 42). A mimimum sample volume of 450µL to 650
µL was required for confirmatory testing depending on the specific comparator method used.
A total of 562 archived nasopharyngeal swabs and 136 throat swabs was obtained. Of these,
20 nasopharyngeal swabs and 8 throat swabs were excluded from the analysis of
performance due to invalid BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel results or to invalid or missing

Contrived Specimens
Additional performance data for various low prevalence throat swab analytes were also
obtained from testing contrived specimens that were prepared at BioFire Diagnostics,
randomized and distributed to three of the sites that also participated in the Prospective
Clinical Study. The contrived specimens comprised individual throat swab specimens in
Amies medium that were spiked with various isolates/strains of each of the targeted
bacteria/viruses. Each analyte was spiked into at least 50 unique clinical specimens, with at
least half at a concentration equivalent to ≤ 2X LoD. Additional samples that were expected
to produce negative results for all BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel analytes were included
as controls. Testing of the contrived specimens was integrated alongside testing of the
prospectively collected and archived specimens.
In total, 464 contrived specimens were prepared for the study, of which 33 were excluded
from the analysis of performance as shown in Table 47.

Clinical Performance
Nasopharyngeal Swabs
A summary of the results from testing prospectively collected and archived nasopharyngeal
swabs is shown in Table 48. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) ranged from 96.3-100% for
prospectively collected specimens and from 96.0-100% for archived specimens, depending
on the analyte, whereas Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) ranged from 90.6-100% for
prospectively collected specimens and from 96.7-100% for archived specimens. The only
analyte for which NPA was < 95% was Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus with prospectively
collected specimens. However, additional testing provided evidence for the presence of
Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus in 54/72 prospectively collected specimens (75.0%) with
discordant positive BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel results and therefore the low NPA with
this analyte in the prospective study was considered acceptable.
Overall, the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel exhibited acceptable PPA and NPA in
comparison to other FDA-cleared methods for the detection of the targeted analytes in
nasopharyngeal swab specimens.

1 54/72 specimens with “false-positive” results for Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (75.0%) were reported positive for these
analytes upon retesting with the same FDA-cleared comparator (1), by testing with either an alternative FDA-cleared assay
(44) or with PCR followed by bidirectional sequencing (8), or both (1).
Throat Swabs
The performance of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel with prospectively collected,
archived and contrived throat swab specimens is summarized in Table 49. Additional details
regarding the analysis of the contrived specimens, stratified by target level, are shown in
Table 50.
For all analytes on the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel for which positive specimens were
available, except Human Metapneumovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus, PPA (or
sensitivity, as applicable) with prospectively collected throat swab specimens ranged from
92.3-100%. For Human Metapneumovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus, PPA in the
Prospective Clinical Study was 88.2 and 87.5%, respectively, although in both cases the total
number of positive specimens tested was small. Additional positive results were obtained
upon retesting of those specimens with initial false-negative BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST
Panel results (Table 49), suggesting the presence of low levels of the target analyte. In
addition, for both analytes, each of the archived positive specimens that was tested produced
the expected positive result, as did 91.8 to 98.0% of contrived positive specimens that were
prepared with different strains of each virus. In combination, the results for detection of
Human Metapneumovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus in throat swabs were considered
acceptable in the context of the proposed Intended Use/Indications For Use for the BIOFIRE
SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel and associated limitations in the device labeling.
Based on the observed clinical sensitivity of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel for the
detection of S. pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) in throat swab specimens, culture
confirmation of negative BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel results for this analyte is not
required. However, the following Limitation is included in the device labeling:
“Additional follow-up testing by culture is required if the SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel
Streptococcus pyogenes assay result is negative and clinical symptoms persist, or in the
event of an outbreak of acute rheumatic fever (ARF).”

1 Positive percent agreement (PPA) for Adenovirus with archived specimens was < 90% although the number of specimens
tested was small. PPA was > 90% with prospectively collected specimens. Overall, PPA for detection of Adenovirus was
considered acceptable.
2 1/2 specimens with false-negative results for Human Metapneumovirus produced a positive result on retest. In combination
with the results from testing archived contrived specimens, PPA for Human Metapneumovirus was considered acceptable.
3 Refer to Table 50 for additional analysis.
4 Using an alternative molecular method, Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus was detected in 14/43 specimens with false-positive
BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel results.
5 3/3 specimens with false-negative results for Respiratory Syncytial Virus produced positive results on retest.
6 Performance compared to culture is expressed in terms of sensitivity and specificity.
Additional analysis of the results from testing contrived throat swab specimens to evaluate
the performance of the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel with low prevalence analytes is
shown in Table 50, stratified by target level. For all analytes included in the Contrived
Specimen Study, PPA was ≥ 95% except for Human Metapneumovirus for which unexpected
negative results were obtained at the lowest target level tested (2X the claimed LoD).
However, the expected positive results were obtained with the same isolates at all other
levels tested, suggesting that the false-negative results were associated with reduced
precision of the system at target levels close to the LoD.

BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel Completion Rate
The frequency of BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System errors and the rate of BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE
R/ST Panel internal control failure in each of the Clinical Studies conducted to evaluate panel
performance (Prospective, Archived and Contrived) are summarized in Table 51. Based on
initial test results for each specimen, the frequency of instrument errors was < 1% in each
study, while the rate of invalid BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel results due to internal
control failure ranged from 1.0 to 4.1%.
