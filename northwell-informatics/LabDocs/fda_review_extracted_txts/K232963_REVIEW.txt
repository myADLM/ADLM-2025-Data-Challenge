IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2 AST
card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on all cards.
The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the nutrient
media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45 to 0.5% saline
before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will
automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the organism suspension to prepare an inoculum
for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and place the card into the incubator/reader.
The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems
monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. The analysis program
determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured by an optical
scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for
the antimicrobial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains
the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the
card.
VITEK 2 AST-YS Anidulafungin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.0625, 0.125, 0.5, 2,
and 8 (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The anidulafungin MIC
result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤0.015 – ≥8 μg/mL.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is based
on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes throughout
the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light transmittance
readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is prevented from
passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC values and their
associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an
automatically generated report.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-Yeast Anidulafungin was conducted at three
sites (two external and one internal site) using a panel of ten Candida species consistent with
the indications for use (i.e., two isolates of Candida glabrata, six isolates of Candida krusei,
and two isolates of Candida parapsilosis). Each isolate was tested in triplicate, using separate
inocula, over three days for a total of 270 data points. Inocula were prepared using both the
autodilution and manual dilution methods for testing with the VITEK 2 System. In addition,
inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method for testing with the VITEK 2 Compact.
The mode of MIC values was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was
calculated based on the number of MIC values that fell within ± 2 doubling dilution of the
mode.

All MIC results were on-scale; therefore, only best-case results are reported (Table 1). The
testing resulted in overall best case reproducibility of 100% (270/270) for autodilution and
manual dilution in the VITEK 2 System and 100% (270/270) for the VITEK 2 Compact
System (manual dilution only). The reproducibility data was acceptable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Inoculum Density Check: The DensiCHEK Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a
0.5 McFarland standard. The instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at
each site. Calibration values were within the expected range.
Purity Check: A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to
prepare the VITEK 2 card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in the
study.
Growth or Device Failure: The VITEK 2 AST-YS Anidulafungin trial had several device
failures including isolated mechanical failures that did not repeat (card recognition,
mechanical jam, failure to eject, dispenser/pipettor failure, communication error and an
optics failure). These errors did not raise concerns since they were isolated and did not reflect
systematic issues. There were zero growth failures.
Quality Control Testing: The CLSI recommended QC strains Candida krusei (ATCC 6258)
and Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) were tested a minimum of 20 times at each site by
the reference method, the VITEK 2 instrument platform using both autodilution and manual
dilution methods, and the VITEK 2 Compact instrument platform using the manual dilution
method. A summary of the QC performance is provided in Table 2.

• Inoculum: Direct colony suspension
• Incubation: 35ºC; 24 hours (up to 48 hours for isolates that are not growing well)
The VITEK 2 cards were inoculated with test organisms using the autodilution method
(VITEK 2) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test
inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using
the DensiCHEK instruments. A total of 485 clinical isolates were evaluated using
autodilution and VITEK 2. The majority of the isolates were recently isolated from clinical
specimens and 177 of the 485 clinical isolates tested were from stock isolates (36.5%). The
clinical isolates included: 185 C. albicans isolates, 78 C. glabrata isolates, 62 C. parapsilosis
isolates, 74 C. tropicalis isolates, 19 C. guilliermondii isolates and 67 C. krusei isolates.
A total of 80 challenge isolates including 21 C. albicans isolates, 38 C. glabrata isolates, 10
C. parapsilosis isolates, 7 C. tropicalis isolates, 2 C. guilliermondii isolates and 2 C. krusei
isolates were evaluated at two external sites and one internal site.

Essential agreement (EA) was calculated for when the VITEK 2 system results were within +/- two doubling
dilutions of the reference method results. Evaluable results are those that are on-scale for both the reference method
and VITEK 2 system or results in which an off-scale result is clearly more than two doubling dilutions from the on-
scale result. Category agreement was calculated for when the VITEK 2 system result interpretations agreed exactly
with the reference method result qualitative interpretations.
For C. albicans evaluated using VITEK 2 and autodilution, the overall EA and CA were both
acceptable at 100% (Table 3). For C. glabrata evaluated using VITEK 2 and autodilution, the
overall EA and CA were acceptable at 97.4% and 98.3%, respectively (Table 3), with one minor
error (0.9% of 116 isolates) and one major error (0.9% of 111 isolates). For C. guilliermondii
evaluated using VITEK 2 and autodilution, the overall EA and CA were both acceptable at
90.5% (Table 3), with two minor errors (10% of 20 isolates). For C. krusei evaluated using
VITEK 2 and autodilution, the overall EA and CA were acceptable at 98.6% and 100%,
respectively (Table 3), with no errors.
For C. parapsilosis evaluated using VITEK 2 and autodilution, the overall EA was acceptable at
100% (Table 3); however, the CA was 86.1% with nine of ten errors being minor errors (12.5%)
and one major error (1.6%). According to the “Class II Special Control Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA, August
2009” (AST guidance), a CA of < 90% may be acceptable if the EA of the evaluable test results
is very good and the majority of the discrepancies as minor discrepancies; therefore, the CA
performance was considered acceptable.
For C. tropicalis evaluated using VITEK 2 and autodilution, the overall EA and CA were
acceptable at 97.5% and 96.3%, respectively (Table 3), with two minor errors (2.5% of 81
isolates). There was one very major error (33.3% of 3 isolates), which is considered a random
error due to the limited number of resistant isolates evaluated. To address the high very major
error rate, the following statement is included as a footnote to the performance table in the device
labeling:
When evaluating VITEK 2 AST-YS Anidulafungin autodilution performance,
there was a single very major error (VMJ) that resulted in an unacceptable VMJ
rate of 33.3% (1/3) with C. tropicalis.
Challenge Data –VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Manual Dilution
The 80 challenge isolates were also evaluated with the manual dilution option of the VITEK 2
and VITEK 2 Compact systems (summarized in Table 4).

Essential agreement (EA) was calculated for when the VITEK 2 system results were within +/- two doubling
dilutions of the reference method results. Evaluable results are those that are on-scale for both the reference method
and VITEK 2 system or results in which an off-scale result is clearly more than two doubling dilutions from the on-
scale result. Category agreement was calculated for when the VITEK 2 system result interpretations agreed exactly
with the reference method result qualitative interpretations.
The EA and CA for C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. guilliermondii, and C. krusei
challenge set were 100% with the manual dilution option and the VITEK 2 systems, which is
acceptable.
For C. parapsilosis and the VITEK 2 manual dilution method, the overall EA was acceptable at
100% for both VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact and the overall CA for VITEK 2 was 90%
which is acceptable (Table 4); however, the overall CA was 80% for VITEK 2 Compact which
was caused by two minor errors out of ten values (20% error rate). The AST guidance indicates a
CA of < 90% may be acceptable if the EA of the evaluable test results is very good and the
majority of the discrepancies as minor discrepancies; therefore, the CA performance was
considered acceptable. There were no major errors or very major errors obtained with any of the
indicated organisms tested when applying the current FDA-recognized breakpoints.
As required under 511A(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the

Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the
safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility
is tested by this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate
and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to
microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage in the drug
label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information in those instances is
unknown. The approved labeling for specific antimicrobial drugs provides the
uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.
Resistant Strains
For C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. guilliermondii and C. krusei, no resistant isolates were
available for evaluation during clinical or challenge testing. In addition, for C. glabrata and C.
tropicalis there were limited resistant isolates available for evaluation during clinical or
challenge testing. The sponsor included the following limitation in the device labeling:
The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s)
is unknown because resistant strains were not available at the time of
comparative testing:
• Anidulafungin (ani01n): Candida spp.
MIC Trends:
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the VITEK 2 autodilution method for each organism group. This trending calculation takes
into account MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or
higher than the reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values are on-scale or
not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact
agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered int the trending analysis.
Organism groups for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs.
lower readings was > 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined to be
statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that showed
higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in the labeling.

A trend toward lower MIC values was observed for C. albicans when compared to the CLSI
broth microdilution reference method, as summarized in Table 5. The following statement is
included as a footnote to the performance table in the device labeling to address the observed
trending:
VITEK 2 Anidulafungin MIC values for C. albicans tended to be in exact
agreement or at least one doubling dilution lower than the reference MIC values.
A trend toward higher MIC values was observed for C. glabrata and C. krusei when compared to
the CLSI broth microdilution reference method, as summarized in Table 5. The following
statement is included as a footnote to the performance table in the device labeling to address the

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission incorporated by reference a breakpoint change
protocol that was reviewed and accepted by FDA in submission K230864 cleared on July 5,
2023. The referenced protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in response to
breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-resources/fda-recognized-antimicrobial-susceptibility-
test-interpretive-criteria). The referenced protocol outlined the specific procedures and
acceptance criteria that bioMérieux intends to use to evaluate the bioMérieux VITEK 2 AST-
Yeast Anidulafungin (≤ 0.015 - ≥ 8 µg/mL) when revised breakpoints for Anidulafungin are
published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the
submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the VITEK 2 AST-
Yeast Anidulafungin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance
section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and
(3) any new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
