IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2 AST
card contains 64 wells. A control well(s) which contain only nutrient medium is resident on all cards.
The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials combined with the nutrient
media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45 to 0.5% saline
before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System will
automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the organism suspension to prepare an inoculum
for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and place the card into the incubator/reader.
The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems
monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. The analysis program
determines when a well demonstrates growth based on attenuation of light measured by an optical
scanner. This data is used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for
the antimicrobial agent. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains
the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the
card.
VITEK 2 AST-YS Voriconazole has the following concentrations in the card: 0.03125, 0.125, 0.25,
1, and 2 (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The Voriconazole MIC
result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤0.03125 – ≥4 μg/mL.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is based
on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes throughout
the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light transmittance
readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is prevented from
passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC values and their
associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are displayed in an
automatically generated report.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST-Yeast Voriconazole was conducted at three
sites (two external and one internal site) using a panel of ten Candida species consistent with
the indications for use (i.e., one isolate of Candida albicans, two isolates of Candida
parapsilosis, six isolates of Candida krusei, and one isolate of Candida tropicalis). Each
isolate was tested in triplicate, using separate inocula, over three days for a total of 270 data
points. Inocula were prepared using both the autodilution and manual dilution methods for
testing with the VITEK 2 System. In addition, inocula were prepared by the manual dilution
method for testing with the VITEK 2 Compact. The mode of MIC values was determined for
each isolate and the reproducibility was calculated based on the number of MIC values that
fell within ±1 and ± 2 doubling dilutions of the mode.
The testing resulted in overall best case reproducibility of >95% for autodilution and manual
dilution in the VITEK 2 System as well as the VITEK 2 Compact System (manual dilution
only) when evaluating both ±1 and ± 2 doubling dilutions of the mode. The overall worst
case reproducibility was >89% for autodilution and manual dilution in the VITEK 2 System
as well as the VITEK 2 Compact System (manual dilution only) when evaluating both ±1
and ± 2 doubling dilutions of the mode. The reproducibility data was acceptable.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Inoculum Density Check: The DensiCHEK Plus was used to standardize the inoculum to a
1.8-2 McFarland standard. The instrument was standardized daily with all results recorded at
each site. Calibration values were within the expected range.
Purity Check: A purity check of all organisms was performed on the dilution tube used to
prepare the VITEK 2 card inoculum. Only those cultures that were pure were evaluated in the
study.
Growth or Device Failure: The VITEK 2 AST-YS Voriconazole trial had several device
failures including isolated mechanical failures that did not repeat (card recognition,
mechanical jam, failure to eject, dispenser/pipettor failure, communication errors and an
optics failure). These errors did not raise concerns since they were isolated and did not reflect
systematic issues. One clinical isolate of C. parapsilosis failed to grow.
Quality Control Testing: The CLSI recommended QC strain Candida krusei (ATCC 6258)
was tested a minimum of 20 times at each site by the reference method, the VITEK 2
instrument platform using both auto- and manual dilution methods, and the VITEK 2
Compact instrument platform using the manual dilution method. A summary of the QC
performance is provided in Table 2.
The quality control results for the VITEK 2 AST-YS Voriconazole were within the
recommended range ≥95% which is acceptable.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Testing of Voriconazole was performed at three external sites and one internal site. Results
obtained with VITEK 2 AST-Yeast Voriconazole were compared to results obtained with the
CLSI broth microdilution reference panel. The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 AST-Yeast
Voriconazole is ≤ 0.03125 - ≥ 4 µg/mL for all species. The testing conditions for the
reference method consisted of the following:
• Medium: RPMI 1640
• Inoculum: Direct colony suspension
• Incubation: 35ºC; 24 hours (up to 48 hours for isolates that are not growing well)
The VITEK 2 cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test
inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using
the DensiCHEK instruments. A total of 460 clinical isolates were evaluated using
autodilution and VITEK 2. One isolate failed to grow in the VITEK 2 card. The results for
the remaining 459 clinical isolates were evaluated. The majority of the isolates were recently
isolated from clinical specimens and 201 of the 459 clinical isolates tested were from stock
isolates (43.8%). The clinical isolates included: 257 C. albicans isolates, 67 C. krusei
isolates, 61 C. parapsilosis isolates, and 74 C. tropicalis isolates.

Essential agreement (EA) was calculated for when the VITEK 2 system results were within +/- two doubling
dilutions of the reference method results. Evaluable results are those that are on-scale for both the reference method
and VITEK 2 system or results in which an off-scale result is clearly more than two doubling dilutions from the on-
scale result. Category agreement was calculated for when the VITEK 2 system result interpretations agreed exactly
with the reference method result qualitative interpretations.
For C. albicans evaluated using VITEK 2 and autodilution, the overall EA and CA were 88.7%
and 86.0%, respectively (Table 3) with 29 minor errors (11.3% of 257 isolates, 3 major errors
(1.3% of 237 isolates), and 4 very major errors (33.3% of 12 isolates), which is not acceptable.

Essential agreement (EA) was calculated for when the VITEK 2 system results were within +/- two doubling
dilutions of the reference method results. Evaluable results are those that are on-scale for both the reference method
and VITEK 2 system or results in which an off-scale result is clearly more than two doubling dilutions from the on-
scale result. Category agreement was calculated for when the VITEK 2 system result interpretations agreed exactly
with the reference method result qualitative interpretations.
The overall EA and CA for C. albicans is >95% (Table 4), with the manual dilution option and
the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 COMPACT instruments, however due to the unacceptable overall
clinical performance, this organism was removed from the Indications for Use.
The overall EA and CA for C. parapsilosis is >95% (Table 4), with the manual dilution option
and the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 COMPACT instruments, which is acceptable. For C. krusei and

the VITEK 2 manual dilution method, the overall EA was acceptable at 100.0%; however, the
CA was 88.9% (Table 4), with one minor error (11.1% of 9 isolates) for both the VITEK 2 and
VITEK 2 COMPACT systems. The AST guidance indicates a CA of < 90% may be acceptable if
the EA of the evaluable test results is very good and the majority of the discrepancies as minor
discrepancies; therefore, the CA performance was considered acceptable. For C. tropicalis, the
overall EA and CA were >90%, with the manual dilution option and the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2
COMPACT instruments (Table 4), with 1 minor error (7.7% of 13 isolates), which is acceptable.
As required under 511A(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the
following statement was added to the package insert to address testing of non-indicated species:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the
safety and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility
is tested by this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate
and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to
microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage in the drug
label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information in those instances is
unknown. The approved labeling for specific antimicrobial drugs provides the
uses for which the antimicrobial drug is approved.
Resistant Strains
There were limited Candida spp. resistant isolates available for evaluation during clinical and
challenge testing. The sponsor included the following limitation in the device labeling:
The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s)
is unknown because resistant strains were not available at the time of
comparative testing:
• Voriconazole (vrc02n): Candida spp.
MIC Trends:
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the VITEK 2 auto-dilution method for each organism group. This trending calculation takes
into account MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or
higher than the reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values are on-scale or
not. Results that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact
agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the trending analysis.
Organism groups for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs.
lower readings was > 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined to be
statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that showed
higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in the labeling.

A trend toward higher MIC values was observed for C. albicans and C. parapsilosis when
compared to the CLSI broth microdilution reference method, as summarized in Table 5. The
following statement is included as a footnote to the performance table in the device labeling to
address the observed trending:
VITEK 2 Voriconazole MIC values for C. parapsilosis tended to be in exact
agreement or at least one doubling dilution higher than the reference MIC values.
A trend toward lower MIC values was observed for C. krusei when compared to the CLSI broth
microdilution reference method, as summarized in Table 5. The following statement is included
as a footnote to the performance table in the device labeling to address the observed trending:
Voriconazole MIC values for C. krusei tended to be in exact agreement or at least
one doubling dilution lower than the reference MIC values.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is not complete and does not support a
substantial equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission incorporated by reference a breakpoint change
protocol that was reviewed and accepted by FDA in submission K230864 cleared on July 3,
2023. The referenced protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in response to
breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-resources/fda-recognized-antimicrobial-susceptibility-
test-interpretive-criteria). The referenced protocol outlined the specific procedures and
acceptance criteria that bioMérieux intends to use to evaluate the bioMérieux VITEK 2 AST-
Yeast Voriconazole (≤ 0.03125 - ≥ 4 µg/mL) when revised breakpoints for Voriconazole are
published on the FDA STIC webpage. The breakpoint change protocol included with the
submission indicated that if specific criteria are met, bioMérieux will update the VITEK 2 AST-
Yeast Voriconazole device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance
section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and
(3) any new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
