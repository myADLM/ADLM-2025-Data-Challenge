The tests may yield positive results for the prescription drugs Buprenorphine, Nortriptyline,
Benzodiazepines, Secobarbital, and Oxycodone when taken at or above prescribed doses. It is
not intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse of these drugs. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result.

specific alternate chemical method must be used. GC/MS or LC/MS is the recommended
confirmatory method.

B Principle of Operation:
The AllTest Multi-Drug Rapid Test Cup/Panel tests are rapid tests for the qualitative detection of
target drug or drug metabolites in urine samples. The tests are lateral flow chromatographic
immunoassays. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. If target
drugs present in the urine specimen are below the cutoff concentration, it will not saturate the
binding sites of its specific monoclonal mouse antibody coated on the particles. The antibody-
coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-conjugate and a visible colored line
will show up in the test line region. The colored line will not form in the test line region if the
target drug level exceeds its cutoff-concentration because it will saturate all the binding sites of
the antibody coated on the particles. A band should form in the control region of the devices
regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample to indicate that the tests have been
performed properly.

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cutoff, -75%
cutoff, -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff, cutoff, +25% cutoff, +50% cutoff , +75% cutoff and
+100% cutoff using 3 lots of the test cup and 3 lots of the test panel. These samples were
prepared by spiking drug in negative urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed
by LC/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples
and didn’t take part in the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were performed 5
replicates per day for 5 days per device in a randomized order. The results obtained for
Amphetamine 1000, Cocaine 300, and Methamphetamine 1000 are summarized in the
following tables. The rest of the data for Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine,

2. Linearity:
Not Applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interfering Substances
Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological
conditions were added to drug-free urine and target drugs urine with concentrations at
25% below and 25% above all analyte cut-off levels in the test. These urine samples
were tested using three lots of each device format by twelve operators (six for the cup
device and six for the panel device). Compounds that showed no interference at a
concentration of 100µg/mL are summarized in the following tables. No differences were
observed for the different device formats.

Cross Reactivity
To test specificity, drug metabolites and other structurally related compounds that are likely
to cross-react in urine samples were spiked into negative urine and were tested using three
lots of each device. The lowest concentrations that caused a positive result for each
compound are listed below for Amphetamine 1000, Cocaine 300, and Methamphetamine
1000. No differences were observed for different device format.
The data for Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Secobarbital,
Benzodiazepines, Morphine, Methadone, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, EDDP,
Nortriptyline and Marijuana were reported in K182738.

Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH
Effect of urine density and pH data were reported only for Amphetamine 1000, Cocaine 300
and Methamphetamine 1000. The rest of the data were reported in the cleared AllTest
submission of K182738.
The effect of pH was evaluated by preparing samples with test drug analytes at +/-25% of the
cutoff for all devices and adjusting the pH to 4.00 to 9.00, in increments of 1 pH unit. There
were no interferences observed.
The effect of specific gravity was evaluated by preparing samples with test drug analytes at
+/-25% of the cutoff for all devices and adjusting the specific gravity to 1.000, 1.005, 1.008,
1.011, 1.013, 1.016, 1.022, 1.025, 1.027, 1.029, 1.033, 1.035. There were no interferences
observed.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not Applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
All drug calibrators of the device are traceable to available commercial reference materials.
6. Detection Limit:
See precision data in Section VII.A.1., above, for assay performance around the claimed
cutoff concentrations.

Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section VII.A.1., above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were performed at the manufacturer’s site using three operators
for each device format (cup and panel). Operators tested a minimum of 40 unaltered positive
and 40 unaltered negative clinical samples for each drug. The samples were blind labeled and
compared to LC/MS results.
The results are presented in the tables below for Amphetamine 1000, Cocaine 300, and
Methamphetamine 1000. The data for Buprenorphine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
Secobarbital, Benzodiazepines, Morphine, Methadone, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, EDDP,
Nortriptyline and Marijuana were reported in K182738.

Lay User Study
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites by 560 lay users. Each lay user tested
only one sample (140 tested the low cutoff test cup, 140 tested the low cutoff test panel, 140
tested the high cutoff test cup, and 140 tested the high cutoff test panel). The lay users had
diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 20 to > 50 years.
Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25%
of the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the
samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers and
blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample
and a device. Each device format was tested. Results are shown below.
