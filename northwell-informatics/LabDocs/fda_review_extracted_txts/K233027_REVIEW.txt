Software and a compatible display that has been 510(k) cleared for use with the NanoZoomer
system or a 510(k)-cleared display that has been assessed in accordance with the Predetermined
Change Control Plan (PCCP) for qualifying additional compatible displays. The NanoZoomer
System is for creation and viewing of digital images of scanned glass slides that would otherwise
be appropriate for manual visualization by conventional light microscopy. It is the responsibility
of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate procedures and safeguards to assure the validity
of the interpretation of images obtained using NanoZoomer System.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner system is comprised of the NanoZoomer S360MD
Slide scanner, NZAcquireMD acquisition software, NZViewMD image viewing software and
compatible displays. The NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner system is an automated system
for creating, viewing, and managing digital slides. The NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner
system creates digital whole slide images (WSIs) of glass slides containing formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (“FFPE”) tissue for pathology primary diagnosis purposes. The digital WSIs
of glass slides may be viewed, stored, retrieved, annotated, and/or shared, permitting the
pathologist to make a primary diagnosis based on the review of the WSIs. The NanoZoomer
system does not include any automated Image Analysis Applications that would constitute
computer aided detection or diagnosis.
K233027 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
The NanoZoomer slide scanner can be loaded with a maximum of 360 glass slides placed in 12
cassettes each with 30 standard-sized slides (length 75.0–76.5 mm, width 24.7–26.5 mm,
thickness 0.9–1.2 mm). Each cassette is manually loaded with slides by the operator, with the
slide labels facing outward so they can still be read while the cassette is loaded into the scanner.
Once the slide’s position is secured, the macro camera located directly above the slide first takes
a picture of the slide’s barcode image as illuminated by an overhead LED, and then takes a
macro image of the actual tissue trans-illuminated by a flat-panel LED underneath. The slide
holder then moves to the micro imaging position for scanning. The system automatically detects
areas where tissues are present and scans a single overall rectangular area containing all detected
tissues. The scanning area is automatically determined using a macro image of the slide. The
NanoZoomer System uses its motorized stage, 20x objective lens, CMOS camera and LED to
detect appropriate focusing points and scan the identified areas of interest. A single micro
camera acquires one square image at a time and the acquired images (tiles) are stitched together
to make a single composite high-resolution image. Images are automatically saved to the hard
disk during scanning and may be viewed later by using the included viewing software. The
NZAcquireMD software organizes all WSI tiles into a single NDPI file. Each digital image
covers an entire slide and typically contains billions of image pixels. The NZAcquireMD
software allows the user to operate the scanner and to store and archive digital images.
The NZViewMD software is a software component intended to run on a separate viewing
workstation PC with a compatible display. The NZViewMD software opens the WSI images
acquired with the NZAcquireMD software and slide scanner from the image storage attached to
local network and renders the image data to the compatible display to deliver the image view at
various magnification levels. The NZViewMD software has the following functionalities:
continuous panning and zooming, comparing multiple slide images simultaneously in multiple
windows, creating annotations during review using annotation tools, tracking of visited areas and
annotations and digital bookmarks.
The new display Barco MDPC-8127 was cleared in K203364. Based on the testing data, it has
equivalent display characteristics as the predicate display JVC JD-C240BN01. The Barco
MDPC-8127 has been validated to be compatible with the NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner
system by both Hamamatsu and Barco.
The NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner system can be connected to a server over a customer-
provided local area network (LAN). The supporting networking hardware and software are not
part of the system and may be located in a room separately from the workstation, viewing
software, and display.
B Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner system (NanoZoomer System)
2. Specimen Identification:
K233027 - Page 3 of 11

--- Page 4 ---
Glass slides and scanned images are identified based on the previously assigned specimen
identifiers such as patient identifiers, barcodes, etc. Digital images of surgical pathology
slides prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling and handling are performed upstream and independent of the use of the
subject device. Specimen sampling includes surgical pathology specimens such as biopsy or
resection specimens which are processed using standard histology techniques. The FFPE
tissue sections are H&E stained. Then digital images are obtained from these glass slides
using the NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner.
4. Calibration:
When the system is launched (powered up), automatic system diagnosis is performed by the
software using the provided calibration slides. This process evaluates the proper functioning
of the light source, imaging sensor, and macro sensor and light source. When necessary,
based on the automatic system diagnosis, adjustment of the shading correction and color
balance correction features is performed automatically by the system. Monthly cleaning such
as dusting of the scan mechanism and optical components is also performed by the user.
System administrators and field service personnel may also complete a system check
following the NZAcquireMD Instructions for Use and the NZTuneMD service software and
the calibration slides. This checks correction status and acquires correction data for whole
slide and scanned images.
Additional calibration and quality control procedures are performed during field service
visits following procedures provided in the NanoZoomer S360MD Maintenance Manual.
These include annual testing of several critical components in the system and annual
calibration of the components and the display.
5. Quality Control:
Quality control (QC) activities are performed by the user. Prior to scanning slides using the
NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner, the user conducts QC of the slides per the laboratory’s
standards and professional guidelines (e.g., staining, cover-slipping, and barcode placement,
etc.). After completing a scan, the user checks the image data and image quality using
Quality Check (QC) mode in NZAcquireMD which includes the following steps:
• Display the Scan Result screen by selecting a slide for which scanning has been completed.
• Confirm scan area, focus quality, and barcode information. Confirm that the barcode
information displayed above the slide image is consistent with the barcode label.
• Check the slide image to ensure all tissue on the slide are present within the scan area.
Manually verifying tissue block with the scanned images is also performed as needed. Slides
are rescanned if necessary.
Before reading the scanned WSIs, the pathologist should ensure that all scanned slide images
have been imported for every case and the images are of acceptable quality for diagnostic
K233027 - Page 4 of 11

--- Page 5 ---
purposes. The pathologist reviews scanned images from all the slides associated with a case
before rendering a diagnosis.
V Substantial Equivalence Information:
A Predicate Device Name (s):
NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner system
B Predicate 510(k) Number(s):
K213883
C Comparison with Predicate(s):
The subject device is similar to the predicate, having similar indications for use, the same
intended use, and the same technological characteristics as its predicate device, with the
exception of the implementation of a Predetermined Change Control Plan (PCCP) that specifies
the protocols and acceptance criteria for validating and adding additional FDA-cleared displays
as interoperable component to the NanoZoomer S360 MD Slide scanner system in a controlled
manner, such that the device is as safe and as effective as the predicate.
The sponsor’s PCCP for validating the use of additional FDA-cleared display is part of the
quality system and comprises the following phases:
1. When a new FDA-cleared display is identified as the candidate, the candidate display,
and its supplier will be evaluated based on various considerations. A design change
request will be generated if the candidate display, and its supplier pass the evaluation.
2. The candidate display will be tested with a set of FDA-approved test methods and
acceptance criteria, including a system-level test for the complete WSI system specified
in the PCCP. The tests will be conducted by a qualified tester according to the quality
management system. If there is a failure detected during the test, the failure(s) will be
recorded, and the design change will not be implemented.
3. If the candidate display meets the acceptance criteria, the design change will be
implemented according to the quality management system and the new display may be
added as an interoperable component to the NanoZoomer S360 MD Slide scanner system
without additional premarket review. The system labeling and company website will be
revised to identify the new display according to the quality management system.
The similarities and differences between the subject and predicate devices are summarized in
