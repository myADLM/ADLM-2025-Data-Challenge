See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The ADVIA Centaur® TSH3-Ultra II (TSH3ULII) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the
quantitative determination of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin) in human serum
and plasma (EDTA and lithium heparin) using the ADVIA Centaur® XP system. Measurements
of thyroid stimulating hormone produced by the anterior pituitary are used in the diagnosis of
thyroid or pituitary disorders.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

Special Instrument Requirements:
ADVIA Centaur® XP System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
ADVIA Centaur TSH3-Ultra (TSH3-UL) kit consists of the following reagents:
• Ultra-Lite Reagent- bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated to monoclonal anti- TSH
(~0.3 μg/mL) labeled with acridinium ester in HEPES buffered saline, mouse IgG, BSA,
goat serum, surfactant, and preservatives.
• Solid Phase Reagent - anti-fluorescein monoclonal mouse antibody covalently linked to
paramagnetic particles (PMP) (~85 μg/mL) in HEPES buffered saline, BSA, goat serum,
surfactant, and preservative.
• Ancillary Well Reagent – Fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated to monoclonal anti-TSH
(~3 μg/mL) in HEPES buffered saline, mouse IgG, BSA, goat serum, surfactant, and
preservative.
Product Materials/Contents:
The ADVIA Centaur TSH3ULII assay kit is comprised of the following components:
• 5 Ready Pack primary reagent packs containing TSH3ULII Lite Reagent, Solid Phase,
and Ancillary Well Reagent (500 tests).
• Advia Centaur TSH3ULII master curve card.
• 2 vials CAL 3A low calibrator.
• 2 vials CAL 3A high calibrator.
• ADVIA Centaur CAL 3A calibrator assigned value cards and barcode labels.
Materials Required but Not Provided
The ADVIA Centaur TSH3ULII assay requires ADVIA Centaur Wash 1 as it is utilized in the
Assay Procedure (see section below).
B Principle of Operation:
This assay is a third-generation assay that employs anti-FITC monoclonal antibody covalently
bound to paramagnetic particles, an FITC-labeled anti-TSH capture mouse monoclonal antibody,
and a tracer consisting of a proprietary acridinium ester and an anti-TSH mouse monoclonal
antibody conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) for chemiluminescent detection.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted following the recommendations in CLSI EP05-A3 to
estimate repeatability and within-laboratory precision.
Repeatability
The study was run on the candidate device, using 3 reagent lots and one instrument. Six
human serum samples, 5 lithium heparin plasma samples, and controls (rhTSH in Multi-
Diluent 15 (MDP 1-5)) were tested in duplicate over twenty days, 2 runs per day, 2 replicates
per run with for a total of 40 runs and 80 replicates. Analysis was conducted using ANOVA
(Analysis of Variance) and the results are summarized below.

Reproducibility
Six human serum samples, five lithium heparin plasma samples, and controls (MDP 1-5)
were tested in replicates of five with one run per day over five days for a total of 225
replicates per sample. Testing was performed using three instruments and three reagent lots.
The analysis and results were similar to the repeatability study summarized above.
2. Linearity:
Linearity testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP06 2nd Edition. The dilution
series contained samples spanning 15 concentrations throughout the measuring range. The
maximum % deviation from linearity observed was 7.2%. The results of the linearity study
support the claimed measuring range of 0.010-150.000 mlU/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference:
Interference testing was performed following the recommendations in CLSI EP07 3rd
Edition. Human serum specimen pools with native analyte were supplemented with
potentially interfering compounds at the levels listed in the table below. The sponsor
provided information to support the following claims:

The sponsor includes the following limitations in their labeling:
Patient samples may contain heterophilic antibodies that could react in immunoassays to give
falsely elevated or depressed results. This assay is designed to minimize interference from
heterophilic antibodies.
Do not use samples that contain fluorescein. Fluorescein levels > 0.24 μg/mL may decrease
results in this assay. Evidence suggests that patients undergoing retinal fluorescein
angiography can retain amounts of fluorescein in the body for up to 48–72 hours post-
treatment. In the cases of patients with renal insufficiency, including many diabetics,
retention could be much longer. Such samples can produce falsely depressed values when
tested with this assay, and should not be tested. Testing of samples spiked with a theoretical
maximum level of fluorescein (250 μg/mL) used in these patients have resulted in TSH levels
< 0.06 μIU/mL instead of the true value of 27.99 μIU/mL.
As with any immuno-recognition measurement of a peptide, extremely rare genetic variants
may exhibit varying degrees of detection.
Cross-Reactivity Testing:
Cross-reactivity was determined using the candidate device in accordance with CLSI EP07
3rd Edition. Cross-reactivity of samples spiked with various substances did not exceed 5%

High-Dose Hook Effect:
The high-dose hook effect of the candidate device was measured on one instrument using a
dilution series. No hook effect was seen up to 3000 μIU/mL. Samples with TSH
concentrations above the measuring interval and as high as 3000 μIU/mL will report > 150
mlU/L.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See section VII.A.2 Linearity.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
This assay is traceable to the World Health Organization (WHO) 3rd International Reference
Preparation for human TSH (IRP 81/565).
6. Detection Limit:
Detection capability was determined in accordance with CLSI Document EP17-A2.
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined to be 0.005 μIU/mL (mIU/L), the limit of detection
(LoD) was determined to be 0.008 μIU/mL (mIU/L) and the limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was
determined to be 0.010 μIU/mL (mIU/L).
The LoB corresponds to the highest measurement result likely to be observed for a blank
sample with a probability of 95%. The LoD corresponds to the lowest analyte concentration
that can be detected with a probability of 95%. The LoQ corresponds to the lowest analyte
concentration at which the within laboratory CV is ≤ 20%.
