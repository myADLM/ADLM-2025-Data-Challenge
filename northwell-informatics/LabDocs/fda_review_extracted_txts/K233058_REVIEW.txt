B Principle of Operation:
VivaChek™ Link Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System is designed to quantitatively measure
the glucose concentration in fresh capillary whole blood. The glucose measurement is achieved
by using the amperometric detection method. The test is based on measurement of electrical
current caused by the reaction of the glucose with the reagents on the electrode of the test strip.
The blood sample is pulled into the tip of the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the
sample reacts with glucose oxidase and the mediator. Electrons are generated, producing a
current that is proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. After the reaction time,
the glucose concentration in the sample is displayed.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
VivaChek™ Link Plus Blood Glucose Meter
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose system is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only.
The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
4. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The meter is automatically
coded.
5. Quality Control:
Three levels of glucose control solutions are available for use with this system and can be
purchased separately. Recommendations on when to test with control solutions are provided
in the labeling. Acceptable ranges for each level of control solution are printed on the test
strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside
these ranges. The control solution readings are automatically marked by the meter as control
results and are not included in the patient result averages.
This medical device product has functions subject to FDA premarket review as well as functions
that are not subject to FDA premarket review. For this application, if the product has functions
that are not subject to FDA premarket review, FDA assessed those functions only to the extent
that they either could adversely impact the safety and effectiveness of the functions subject to
FDA premarket review or they are included as a labeled positive impact that was considered in
the assessment of the functions subject to FDA premarket review.

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to
600 mg/dL. If a sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as “LO”. If a
sample result is more than 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as “HI”. The low
and high functions were validated and demonstrated to function as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed with 10 VivaChek™ Link Plus Blood Glucose Meters
and 3 lots of VivaChek™ Ino Blood Glucose Test Strips. The study was conducted using
venous whole blood samples adjusted to 3 glucose levels (50-70, 110-130, and 225-270
mg/dL) as measured by the comparative method (YSI 2300 STAT PLUS Glucose and L-
Lactate Analyzer). The adjusted blood glucose concentrations were separated into a control
sample with no interferent added and a test sample containing one of 32 potentially
interfering substances. No significant interference between the test and the control samples
was defined by the sponsor as within ± 4.8 mg/dL at < 75 mg/dL glucose and within ± 8% at
> 75 mg/dL glucose. The highest concentrations at which no significant interference t was
observed are presented in the table below:

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit Study
The effect of hematocrit on the VivaChek™ Link Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System
was evaluated with venous blood samples adjusted to hematocrit levels of 20%, 25%, 30%,
35%, 42%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, and 70%. Each hematocrit level was adjusted to achieve
five concentrations of glucose (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250, and 251 to 400
mg/dL). Each blood sample was tested using 10 VivaChek™ Link Plus Blood Glucose
Meters with 3 lots of VivaChek™ Ino Blood Glucose Test Strips and tested on the YSI 2300
comparator method. The glucose values were compared to results obtained on the YSI 2300
comparator method, and to the normal hematocrit sample. The results support the claimed
hematocrit range of 20% to 70% for the VivaChek™ Link Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring
System.
2. System Operating Conditions Study
The sponsor performed an operating condition study using venous whole blood samples
adjusted to 3 glucose levels (60 to 70, 100 to 120, and 300 to 400 mg/dL). Testing was
conducted under the following five temperature and relative humidity (RH) combinations:
113°F (45°C) and 41°F (5°C), at 10% and 90% RH each and at 73°F (23°C) at 40% RH. The
candidate system results were compared to results from the YSI 2300 comparator method.
The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 41–
113°F (5-45°C) with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
3. Altitude Effects
The effect of altitude on the VivaChek™ Link Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System was
evaluated by testing whole blood samples at sea level (130 ft) and at 10,413 ft above sea
level. The candidate system results were compared to those obtained with the comparator
method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results support the claims that the system functions as
intended at altitudes up to the claimed altitude of 10,413 feet.
4. Sample Volume Study
The sponsor conducted a sample volume study using venous blood samples prepared at three
glucose range intervals at thee glucose levels (50-65, 110-120, and 200-250 mg/dL) that were
tested at different sample volumes (0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 μL). The candidate system results were
compared against the YSI 2300 comparator method measurements. Results support the
claimed minimum sample volume of 0.8 μL. The sponsor also provided validation studies
demonstrating that with blood volumes below 0.8 μL, the insufficient sample volume error
message functioned as intended.
5. Flex Studies
Intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, testing with used test strips, test strip early
removal, drop/shock testing, and vibration testing was completed. The testing performed
demonstrated that VivaChek™ Link Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are robust to
intermittent sampling, sample perturbation, drop/shock, and vibration, and that an error
message is returned to the user if a used test strip is inserted into the meter or test strip
removal happens early.

6. Infection Control Studies
The VivaChek™ Link Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems is intended for single-patient
use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the
meters by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Germicidal Wipes, 0.55%
sodium hypochlorite (EPA Registration # 67619-12). Robustness studies were also
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external
materials of the meter after 608 cleaning and disinfection cycles with the Clorox Germicidal
Wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use.
Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection
procedures.
7. Electrical Safety and EMC Studies
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed and the system was found
to be compliant.
8. Test Strip Lot Release Protocol
The test strip lot release protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
