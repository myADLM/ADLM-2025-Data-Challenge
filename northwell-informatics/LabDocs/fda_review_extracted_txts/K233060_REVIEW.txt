III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Binding assay for the in vitro quantitative determination of folate in erythrocytes (red blood
cells, RBC). Folate measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of anemia. The
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, “ECLIA” is intended for use on cobas e immunoassay
analyzers.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Cobas e 801 analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Elecsys Folate III (RBC Application) is a modified version of the predicate assay to increase
tolerance to biotin interference. The Elecsys Folate III (RBC Application) reagent pack includes
the following reagents:
• PT1 Pretreatment reagent 1
• PT2 Pretreatment reagent 2
• M Streptavidin-coated microparticles
• R1 Folate-binding protein~Ru (bpy)
• R2 Folate~biotin
Other materials required to run the assay, but not included in the kit include: CalSet Folate,
PreciControl Varia and Folate RBC Hemolyzing Reagent.
B Principle of Operation:
Elecsys Folate III (RBC Application) is a competition principle assay with a total duration of 27
minutes. Whole blood treated with anticoagulants is mixed with ascorbic acid solution and
incubated at 20-25 °C for lysis of the erythrocytes to take place, with liberation and stabilization
of the intracellular folate. Fifteen (15 μL) of resulting hemolysate sample is incubated with the
folate pretreatment reagents 1 and 2. Bound folate is released from endogenous folate binding
proteins. The pretreated sample is then incubated with the ruthenium-labeled folate binding
protein forming a folate complex, the amount of which is dependent upon the analyte
K233060 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
concentration in the sample. After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles and folate
labeled with biotin, the unbound sites of the ruthenium labeled folate binding protein become
occupied, with formation of a ruthenium labeled folate binding protein-folate biotin complex.
The entire complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then removed
with ProCell II M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent
emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined via a calibration curve
which is instrument-specifically generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via
the cobas link.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted for both 21 days and 5 days with the Elecsys Folate III
(RBC Application) to evaluate repeatability (within-run precision) and intermediate precision
(within-laboratory precision) according to the CLSI guideline EP05-A3.
Repeatability and Intermediate Precision (21 Days)
Precision was evaluated on one cobas e 801 analyzer with one reagent lot. Five human
hemolysate samples prepared from whole blood samples collected in K3-EDTA tubes and
each of the three levels of control were tested in two replicates per run, two runs per day for
21 days (n=84 measurements per sample). Repeatability and intermediate imprecision were
calculated in accordance with CLSI EP05-A3. Results are summarized in the table below.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the Elecsys Folate III (RBC Application) was assessed using human hemolysate
samples prepared from whole blood samples collected in K3-EDTA tubes on the cobas e 801
analyzer. The studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP06-Ed2 using three series
comprised of 9-10 levels of samples ranging from ~103 to 656 ng/mL. Samples were tested
using one lot of reagent, run in 4 replicates within a single run. The linearity data was
analyzed using a weighted linear regression model according to CLSI EP06-Ed2. The
deviation from linearity did not exceed 5% within the claimed measuring interval.

The results support the Elecsys Folate III (RBC Application)’s measuring range of 120 - 620
ng/mL.
Dilution Study
The sponsor provided information to support that samples with folate concentrations above
the measuring range can be diluted with Elecsys Folate RBC Hemolyzing Reagent. For the
Elecsys Folate III (RBC Application), the recommended manual dilution is 1:2. The
concentration of the diluted sample must be ≥265 ng/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference - Endogenous substances
An interference study was performed using eight endogenous substances (biotin, lipemia,
bilirubin, rheumatic factor, albumin, human IgG, human IgM, and human IgA) for potential
interference with the Elecsys Folate III (RBC Application) on the cobas e 801 analyzer. For
each potentially interfering substance, three human hemolysate samples prepared from whole
blood samples collected in K3-EDTA tubes containing low, mid, and high concentrations of
142 ng/mL, 359 ng/mL, 488 ng/mL were tested with 5 replicates per sample. Recovery
(absolute deviation or % recovery) was calculated for each sample compared to the reference
(control sample with no potential interferent added). Results are summarized below.

Interference - Exogenous substances
An interference study was conducted to evaluate 17 drugs and human erythropoietin for
potential interference with the Elecsys Folate III (RBC Application). Two human hemolysate
samples prepared from whole blood samples collected in K3-EDTA tubes with folate
