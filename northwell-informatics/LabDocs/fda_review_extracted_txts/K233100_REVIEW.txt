*Both Rhinovirus and Enterovirus are detected but not differentiated.
C Type of Test:
Multiplexed real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid assay for use with the
QIAstat-Dx System for the qualitative detection of viral and bacterial pathogens in individuals
with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
Intended Use(s):
The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus is a multiplexed nucleic acid test intended for use with
the QIAstat-Dx system for the simultaneous in vitro qualitative detection and identification of
multiple respiratory viral and bacterial nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) obtained
from individuals with clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection, including
SARS-CoV-2.
The following organism types and subtypes are identified using the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory
Panel Plus: Adenovirus, Human Coronavirus 229E, Human Coronavirus HKU1, Human
Coronavirus NL63, Human Coronavirus OC43, Human Metapneumovirus, Influenza A,
Influenza A H1, Influenza A H1N1 pdm09, Influenza A H3, Influenza B, Parainfluenza virus 1,
K233100 - Page 2 of 29

--- Page 3 ---
Parainfluenza virus 2, Parainfluenza virus 3, Parainfluenza virus 4, Respiratory Syncytial Virus,
Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (not differentiated), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma
pneumoniae.
Nucleic acids from viral and bacterial organisms identified by this test are generally detectable in
NPS specimens during the acute phase of infection. Detecting and identifying specific viral and
bacterial nucleic acids from individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of a respiratory
infection aids in the diagnosis of respiratory infection, if used in conjunction with other clinical,
epidemiological and laboratory findings. The results of this test should not be used as the sole
basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
Negative results in the presence of a respiratory illness may be due to infection with pathogens
that are not detected by the test or due to lower respiratory tract infection that is not detected by a
NPS specimen.
Conversely, positive results are indicative of the presence of the identified microorganism, but
do not rule out co-infection with other pathogens not detected by the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory
Panel Plus. The agent(s) detected by the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus may not be the
definite cause of disease.
The use of additional laboratory testing (e.g., bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence
and radiography) may be necessary when evaluating a patient with possible respiratory tract
infection.
A Indication(s) for Use:
See Intended Use (above)
B Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro Diagnostic Use Only
C Special Instrument Requirements:
The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus is part of the QIAstat-Dx system and works only with
the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus is part of the QIAstat-Dx system and works with the
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0. The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus Cartridge is a single-use
K233100 - Page 3 of 29

--- Page 4 ---
cartridge that includes all reagents needed for nucleic acid extraction, nucleic acid
amplification, and detection of bacteria and viruses (or their subtypes), including SARS-
CoV-2, that cause respiratory symptoms. Testing requires a small specimen volume and
minimal hands-on time, and the results are available in approximately one hour.
The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus is intended to be used with one (l) nasopharyngeal
swab (NPS) eluted in Universal Transport Media (UTM), which is not provided with the
QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus.
The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory panel initially received FDA clearance in May 2019 (K183597). In
March 2020, the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel received EUA authorization which
included the addition of SARS-CoV-2 reagents to an independent reaction chamber (i.e., not
multiplexed with other analyte reagents) and a reduction in concentration of a lysis reagent. The
QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus is identical to the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2
Panel. The other analyte reagents are unmodified from that cleared in K183597.
B Principle of Operation:
The test starts automatically upon insertion of the test cartridge and runs for approximately 1
hour. When the test is finished, the cartridge is removed by the user and discarded. The
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 automatically interprets test results and displays a summary on the
analyzer display screen. The results can be printed using a connected printer if needed. The
detected analytes are displayed in red. All other tested but not detected analytes are listed in
green. The analyzer will report if an error occurs during processing, in which case the test
will fail, and no results will be provided (screen will show “FAIL”).
All the reagents required for the complete execution of the test are pre-loaded and self-
contained in the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus cartridge. The user does not need to
manipulate any reagents. During the test, reagents are handled by pneumatically operated
microfluidics without any direct contact with the user or the analyzer actuators.
Within the cartridge, multiple steps are automatically performed in sequence by using
pneumatic pressure and a multiport valve to transfer sample and fluids via the Transfer
Chamber (TC) to their intended destinations. Following the introduction of the sample from
a disposable transfer pipette, the following assay steps occur automatically and sequentially:
• Resuspension of air-dried internal control and Proteinase K (ProtK) enzyme
using provided buffer and mixing with the liquid sample (IC Cavity and ProtK
Cavity).
• Cell lysis using mechanical (rotation) and chemical (chaotropic and isotonic)
means (lysis chamber).
• Membrane based nucleic acid purification from lysate by:
Mixing lysate with binding buffer and capturing on the membrane
(purification chamber).
- First washing of membrane to remove bound proteins (purification
chamber and waste chamber).
- Second washing of membrane to leave only bound nucleic acids
(purification chamber and waste chamber).
- Rinsing of Transfer Chamber (TC) using the rinsing buffer before
introduction of the eluate (TC).
-
K233100 - Page 4 of 29

--- Page 5 ---
Drying of membrane with bound nucleic acids with air flow generated
by a high flow vacuum pump (purification chamber).
- Elution of nucleic acids with elution buffer (purification chamber and TC).
• Mixing of the purified nucleic acid (eluate) with lyophilized “Master Mix”
reag-ents (dry chemistry container and TC).
• Sequential transfer of defined aliquots of mixed eluate/Master Mix from the
Transfer Chamber to each of eight Reaction Chambers containing the specified,
air dried primers and probes. Note that each target specific probe contains a
specific fluorescent dye that permits differentiation of target specific
amplification within each Reaction Chamber).
• Within each Reaction Chamber, real-time, multiplex PCR (“rtPCR”) testing is
performed. Increase in fluorescence (indicative of detection of each target
analyte) is detected directly within each Reaction Chamber.
• The detected signal per fluorescent marker per Reaction Chamber is then used
by the system software to generate the assay result.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0, with software version 1.4 or higher.
2. Specimen Identification:
The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer is a fully automated instrument that is bi-directionally interfaced
and accepts orders from the LIS system. While test orders can be manually programmed
through the attached instrument computer, a LIS-generate barcode can also be scanned to
initiate testing.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens collected in transport medium.
4. Calibration:
The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 is provided factory calibrated and does not require user
calibration.
5. Quality Control:
Control Materials
a) External Controls
External Controls are not provided with the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus. The
following information on external control testing is included in the Instructions for Use,
K233100 - Page 5 of 29

--- Page 6 ---
“External controls are not provided with the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus. Quality
control requirements should be performed in conformance with local, state, and/or federal
regulations or accreditation requirements and your laboratory’s standard quality control
procedures.”
External controls for performance studies were commercially obtained: NATtrol
ZeptoMetrix Respiratory Verification Panel (cat. id NATRVP-QIA) and ZeptoMetrix
NATtrol SARS-CoV-2 (E/ORF1ab) recombinant (cat. id. 0831043). These were diluted with
negative transport medium prior to use. The negative sample was prepared using transport
medium only. The controls yielded expected results on all days of testing.
b) Internal Controls
The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Cartridge includes an Internal Control (IC), which is a
titered lyophilized MS2 bacteriophage that provides verification that all steps of the analysis
process including sample resuspension, lysis, nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription,
and PCR were successful. The results screen displays a message indicating that the internal
controls “Passed” when the test was run successfully. An IC message of “Failed” indicates
that the internal control was not amplified; ‘Positive’ test results are still reported as positive,
but all ‘Negative’ results are invalid.

Two additional runs were performed due to partially invalidated runs.
SARS-CoV-2 samples were detected within performance expectations across all
concentrations. All negative and low positive samples for the remaining analytes
exhibited expected performance, achieving a percent agreement of 100% and at least
95.6%, respectively. Moderate positive samples achieved 100% expected positivity
except influenza B (98.9%) and M. pneumoniae (97.8%). Notably, two tests were
unexpectedly negative for M. pneumoniae and one test for influenza B. Unexpected
negatives occurred across two lots and was attributed to a processing error. Repeat
testing using the same cartridge lots and samples produced expected results. Overall, all
panels met the acceptability criteria.
The mean and variability analysis between days, instruments, replicates, operators, lots
and the overall (total) variability for Ct values for the SARS-CoV-2 analyte is shown in
Table 2. Overall, the percent coefficient of variation (% CV) ranged from 0.0 – 2.3%
with the greatest factor of variability attributed to between replicate Ct-variability at the
1x LoD level with a standard deviation of 0.8 Ct-value and 2.21% CV.

Assay variability for the subset of other analytes included in the study did not exceed
those in the original 510(k) K183597 clearance (data not shown). Overall, Ct variability
was low, and the study demonstrates assay variability within an acceptable range.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus configuration of multiple viral and bacterial
respiratory pathogens is the same as the previously cleared device (QIAstat-Dx Respiratory
Panel, K183597), except for the addition of reagents for SARS-CoV-2 detection and a
concentration change to a lysis reagent. Inclusivity wet-testing for the remaining on-panel
analytes was performed previously in K183597 and not repeated here.
a. Wet-Testing
During Limit of Detection studies, five variants of SARS-CoV-2 were tested and
successfully detected. Therefore, no additional inclusivity wet-testing was performed.
b. In silico Analysis
QIAGEN routinely evaluates the overall inclusivity of the entire set of SARS-CoV-2
available genomes, including all relevant variants and lineages. This includes (1)
Inclusivity Analysis and mismatch detection among SARS-CoV-2 strains and (2) the
same analysis focused on specific SARS-CoV-2 variants or lineages, evaluating the
possible effect of detected mismatches on the QIAstat-Dx performance. Only critical
mismatches were evaluated in the laboratory. Laboratory testing was performed using
artificial genomic fragments corresponding to targeted regions and including the
corresponding mismatch.
In total, 8,118,241 available genomes between January 1, 2020 and June 5, 2022 from
around the globe were analyzed for inclusivity. Of them, 7,932,071 (97.71%) presented

no evidence of mismatches in the targeted regions. The remainder of genomes (2.01%)
presented mismatches among the sequence in the binding region, but only 19,045
(0.23%) presented a mismatch in a critical position (i.e., near the 3’-end of any primer)
with a frequency >0.2%. Genetic patterns included among those sequences were
evaluated in laboratory testing, with no loss of performance at LoD level. Consequently,
100% of sequences analyzed were predicted to be detected.
Variants of Concern, of Interest and Under Investigation (VOCs, VOIs, VUI
respectively) were also evaluated from the 8,118,241 sequences. After classifying all
previously analyzed genomes into lineages based on GISAID and PANGO
classifications, the following variants were included: Alpha (9 clades), Beta (5 clades),
Gamma (23 clades), Lambda (2 clades), Mu (4 clades), Delta (242 clades), Omicron (73
clades). As a result, all variants and lineages described are 100% predicted to be detected.
For the rest of the analytes detected by the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus, an
updated in silico analysis was performed to confirm previous device inclusivity results.
All single primers and probes corresponding to targets included in the QIAstat-Dx
Respiratory Panel Plus (non-SARS-CoV-2 targets) were analyzed using BLAST.
All QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus primers and probes are predicted to be inclusive
for all clinical prevalent and relevant strains for each pathogen against all available
sequences in the NCBI data base.
QIAGEN has created a dedicated Post Market Surveillance (PMS) team with the
objective of periodically analyzing all new genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to detect
any mutation pattern that may affect the QIAstat-Dx assay performance and create an
action plan accordingly.
Cross-Reactivity (Exclusivity) and Competitive/Microbial Interference
The potential for cross-reactivity between all QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus on-panel
organisms (including SARS-CoV-2) and various on-panel or off-panel organisms that can
occur in clinical respiratory specimens was evaluated with a combination of laboratory (in
vitro) wet testing and in silico characterization. For laboratory testing, on-panel (intra-panel
cross-reactivity) and off-panel tested organisms (not covered by the panel content and,
therefore, not intended to be detected by the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus) complement
the organisms evaluated in the previously cleared device (QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel),
and additional organisms were selected to assess the specificity of the new SARS-CoV-2
assays included in the Panel. Additionally, all single primers and probes for the SARS-CoV-
2 detection were analyzed in silico to complement the overall specificity prediction of the
device.
a. Wet-Testing
i. On-Panel Cross-Reactivity Testing (Analytical Specificity)
Potential intra-panel cross-reactivity was evaluated with twenty-two (22) on-panel
microorganisms (Table 3). The on-panel organisms were evaluated by spiking each
independently into simulated NPS matrix at >105 TCID /mL (or equivalent) for
50
viruses and >106 CFU/mL (or equivalent) for bacteria, or the highest concentration

available. Data supporting the use of simulated matrix can be found in section VII
Performance Charactestics.B.2. Matrix Equivalency Study, later in this document.
To evaluate potential intra-panel cross-reactivity, each organism was evaluated in
triplicate. No intra-panel cross-reactivity was observed. The results of testing are
shown in Table 3.

obtained results.
c One cartridge fail was repeated.
ii. Off-Panel Cross-Reactivity Testing (Analytical Specificity)
This study evaluated the analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) of the QIAstat-Dx
Respiratory Panel Plus in the presence of non-targeted microorganisms that may be
found in a respiratory tract clinical specimen. Forty-nine (49) non-target
microorganisms (Table 4) were evaluated in the study. Panel members were
composed of one individual non-target microorganism spiked into simulated NPS
matrix at >105 TCID /mL (or equivalent) for viruses, >106 CFU/mL (or equivalent)
50
for bacteria/fungi, or the highest concentration available. Data supporting the use of
simulated matrix can be found in section VII Performance Charactestics.B.2.Matrix
Equivalency Study, later in this document.
To evaluate cross-reactivity, each microorganism was evaluated in triplicate in the
absence of the target organisms. No cross-reactivity was observed at the
concentrations tested except for Bordetella bronchiseptica at a concentration of
1x106 CFU/mL and Bordetella holmesii at a concentration of 1x105 CFU/mL, which
both cross-reacted with the Bordetella pertussis primer/probes in 100% of the
replicates tested for each bacterium. As described for the previously cleared QIAstat-
Dx Respiratory Panel (K183597), the targeted gene for Bordetella pertussis (IS481)
is a mobile transposon also present in B. holmesii (detected in 6/6 replicates) and
some clusters of B. bronchiseptica (detected in 3/3 replicates), so observed cross-
reaction with B. pertussis was expected in both cases. A limitation to this affect has
been included in the Instructions for Use). The results are summarized in Table 4.

a. Two reliability errors were repeated. Repeats were valid and no cross-reactivity was observed
(Reliability errors is a summary term for a class of possible errors that occur during the execution of
the cartridge on the instrument).
b. As described for the previously cleared device, targeted gene for Bordetella pertussis (IS481) is
a mobile transposon also present in B. holmesii (detected in 6/6 replicates) and some clusters of
B. bronchiseptica (detected in 3/3 replicates), so observed cross-reaction with B. pertussis was
expected in both cases.
c. One cartridge fail was repeated.
d. B. pertussis was detected with large Ct value (low concentration) for A. fumigatus (1/6 replicates),
Mycoplasma hominis (1/9 replicates) and S. pyogenes (2/6 replicates). Proper investigation confirmed
B. pertussis contamination in all cases. In silico analysis confirmed lack of cross-reactivity of B.
pertussis assay with all three organisms.
iii. Competitive Interference
A competitive interference study was done to determine if the presence of a subset of
representative on-panel organisms at clinically relevant and challenging
concentrations (1.00E+06 CFU/mL for bacteria, 1.00E+05 PFU/mL for viruses)
would impede the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations (3x LoD) in
simulated NPS matrix. Data supporting the use of simulated matrix can be found in
section VII Performance Charactestics.B.2.Matrix Equivalency Study, later in this
document. Testing was performed in triplicate with SARS-CoV-2 detection in all
samples and replicates (Table 5).

iv. Microbial Interference
A microbial interference study was conducted to assess the inhibitory effects of
select non-target organisms on the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2. Clinically
relevant and challenging concentrations (1.00E+06 CFU/mL for bacteria/fungi,
1.00E+05 PFU/mL for viruses unless otherwise noted) of non-target organisms were
individually mixed with SARS-CoV-2 at 3x LoD in simulated NPS matrix. Data
supporting the use of simulated matrix can be found in section VII Performance
Charactestics.B.2.Matrix Equivalency Study, later in this document. Testing was
performed in triplicate with two additional tests performed if SARS-CoV-2 was not
detected in any one of the original three replicates. All combinations and replicates
successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 except for two samples containing Legionella
pneumophila, one Streptococcus salivarius sample, and one S. epidermidis sample
(Table 6). For these, additional replicates successfully detected SARS-CoV-2.
Where available, at least one additional strain of L. pneumophila or S. salivarius was
also tested in triplicate with all samples successfully detecting SARS-CoV-2. See
Table 6 for a list of the strains tested and the result summary.

Philadelphia and Philadelphia-1 are both designations of strain Philadelphia serogroup-1, differences
in naming are due to supplier.
b. In silico
The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus differs from the previously cleared device
(QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel, K183597) by the addition of primers and probes for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 and a decrease in the concentration of a lysis reagent.
Evaluation of the two SARS-CoV-2 assays was carried out to corroborate the lack of
cross-reactivity.
Exclusivity BLAST-based in silico screening was performed on April 20th 2022,
including all available sequences in the GenBank database. BLAST homology
characterization was performed excluding SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the analysis to
optimize BLAST results to non-target organisms. Results are summarized in Table 7.

Only Thirty-five (35) and 130 evaluated sequences (RdRp and E genes, respectively)
presented possible cross-amplification. After removing synthetic constructs, recombinant,
cloning vectors, or SARS-CoV-2 related coronavirus, only potential nonspecific signals
could be produced by a cross-reaction of the SARS-CoV-2 assays with a few
coronaviruses specific for bats and/or pangolins. Since these organisms are not known to
currently circulate in the human population, the risk of a false positive SARS-CoV-2
result is low. A limitation on potential cross-reactivity of bat and pangolin sequences has

been added to the Instructions for Use. No GenBank sequences corresponding to human-
infective pathogens were predicted to be positive for the primer/probe sets included in the
QIAstat-Dx system to detect SARS-CoV-2.
Interfering Substances
The performance of the QIAStat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated in the presence of medically and/or physiologically
relevant concentrations of potentially interfering substances that may be present in
an NPS specimen. In addition, several technique-specific substances (e.g.,
disinfectants and various brands of swabs or VTM transport mediums) were also
tested as potential sources of assay interference. Samples were tested in triplicate
with and without addition of the potentially inhibitory substance in simulated
NPS matrix using SARS-CoV-2 (NIBSC cat no. 20/146) at 3x LoD. Data
supporting the use of simulated matrix can be found in section VII Performance
Charactestics.B.2.Matrix Equivalency Study, later in this document. No
interference was observed at the concentrations listed for any of the substance
tested (Table 8).

*Two additional cartridges were run in error, results from these runs were valid and are reported here.
All other targets of the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus have been evaluated
in interfering substance studies during the previous device clearance with the
results remaining applicable (see QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel, K183597). The
interference of SARS-CoV-2 detection with a live, intranasal influenza vaccine
(i.e., FluMist or Fluenz) was not assessed. Results from the previously cleared
device on other panel analytes determined that the live intranasally administered
influenza vaccine did not interfere at concentrations of 0.000001% v/v or less,
however, interference was noted at a ten-fold higher concentration (A limitation
to this effect has been added to the Instructions for Use).
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable; this is a qualitative assay.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a. Controls
This assay contains an internal control within each cartridge. External positive and
negative controls are not provided with the assay but were run during the performance
studies. A description of the external controls used in these studies is presented under
section External Controls, earlier in this document.
b. Sample Stability
Sample stability testing demonstrated that NPS specimens in Universal Transport Medium
(UTM) may be stored at the conditions listed below.
• Room temperature up to 4 hours at 15–25°C
• Refrigerated up to 3 days at approximately 4°C
• Frozen up to 14 days at –20°C
c. Cartridge Package Open stability
In a study comprising a subset of panel analytes, including SARS-CoV-2, it was
determined that after the cartridge package is opened, sample should be introduced
into the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus Cartridge and loaded into the QIAstat-Dx
Analyzer 1.0 within 120 minutes.

A limit of detection study (LoD) was performed to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of
the SARS-CoV-2 assays of the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus. In addition, a subset
of the original panel analytes (QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel, K183597) was tested side-
by-side with the candidate device and the previously cleared device (QIAstat-Dx
Respiratory Panel, K183597) to demonstrate that the addition of the SARS-CoV-2
assays and a minor modification to the lysis buffer does not impact the performance of
other analyte assays in other reaction chambers.
a. Limit of Detection for SARS-CoV-2
For this study, five (5) SARS-CoV-2 strains (Table 9) were evaluated individually by
testing serial dilutions prepared in NPS matrix. Testing was broken into two parts:
preliminary and confirmatory LoD testing. For the preliminary LoD study, a serial
dilution series consisting of four concentrations was tested in replicates of four per
dilution. The preliminary LoD for each target was defined as the lowest concentration at
which 100% of replicates were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The confirmed LoD was
established by testing twenty (20) replicates at the concentration determined from the
preliminary LoD for each strain. The LoD for each strain was confirmed if ≥ 95% of the
replicates were positive. To further confirm the LoD, at least one dilution below the LoD
was also tested for each strain in twenty (20) replicates and was required to result in less
than 95% positivity. The confirmed LoD for SARS-CoV-2 is summarized in Table 10.

b. LoD Comparison Study
A subset of six (6) representative analytes (one from each Reaction Chamber) as listed in
Table 11 was included in the LoD comparison study to demonstrate that the addition of
SARS-CoV-2 assays and changes to the lysis reagent concentration do not impact the
performance of assays in other chambers. Twenty (20) replicates of the subset of original
panel analytes were prepared as co-formulated samples using pooled negative clinical
matrix at the LoD concentrations established for the previously cleared device (QIAstat-
Dx Respiratory Panel, K183597). Additionally, twenty (20) replicates were tested at 0.1x
LoD to further verify LoD equivalency. The panel of representative analytes was tested in
parallel with the previously cleared device (QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel, K183597) and
the candidate device. The expected detection rates for both devices were ≥95% of
replicates tested (≥19/20) at the LoD concentration, and <95% (≤18/20) at the 0.1x LoD
concentration. As summarized in Table 12, the LoD for a subset of original panel
analytes was confirmed on both devices in side-by-side testing, which confirmed that the
addition of the SARS-CoV-2 assays and changes to the lysis reagent do not impact the
performance of assays in other chambers. Moreover, the LoDs as determined in K183597
for single-spiked analytes are equivalent to the LoDs determined for individual analytes
under multi-spiked conditions. Multi-spiked LoD studies were not repeated here.

clearance studies and no changes were made with addition of SARS-CoV-2 detection. The Ct
cutoffs are included as automatic calculations in the assay definition file (ADF).
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not Applicable
9. Carry-Over:
A carryover study was performed using the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus to evaluate
the potential occurrence of cross-contamination between consecutive runs and carryover
between cartridge chambers on the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0. Two panels consisting of high
concentrations of influenza A, parainfluenza virus 3, and M. pneumoniae (panel A) or
coronavirus NL63, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 (panel B) in simulated NPS matrix were each
tested multiple times between runs of negative (no analyte) cartridges for a total of 62 runs
across several days. Data supporting the use of simulated matrix can be found in section VII
Performance Charactestics.B.2.Matrix Equivalency Study, later in this document. No
carryover between cartridges or chambers within the cartridges was observed.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not Applicable
2. Matrix Equivalency Study:
Equivalent performance of simulated NPS matrix and natural clinical NPS matrix was
established by testing SARS-CoV-2 isolate England/02/2020 at either 1x LoD or 0.1x LoD
concentrations, co-spiked with a subset of on-panel organisms at a low concentration (1x
LoD). SARS-CoV-2 was also tested alone. Testing of 20 replicates per each combination
was performed with a SARS-CoV-2 detection rate of ≥ 95% for all samples at 1x LoD.
Below the LoD testing performed as expected and, thus, overall matrix equivalency was
established.
Additionally, this study demonstrates that the LoDs of single-spiked SARS-CoV-2 samples
are equivalent to the LoDs determined for SARS-CoV-2 under multi-spiked conditions.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Performance
The clinical performance of the SARS-CoV-2 assays in the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel
Plus was established through a multi-center prospective (i.e., all comers) clinical study
conducted at five (5) geographically diverse study sites in the U.S. [(1) Northridge, CA; (2)
Redondo Beach, CA; (3) Nashville, TN; and (4) Easley, SC; and (5) Milwaukee, WI]. Each site
was tasked with prospective sample collection and testing using the candidate device and the
comparator method. Site 5 was further tasked with discordant testing.
K233100 - Page 25 of 29

--- Page 26 ---
Note: Clinical performance for the non-SARS-CoV-2 analytes was established in K183597 and
not repeated here.
During this study, nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens were prospectively collected in
UTM from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection, from February to
May 2023 and during February 2024.
The clinical performance of the SARS-CoV-2 assays in the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel
Plus was established by comparing results to an FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel
under 21 CFR 866.3981 that includes SARS-CoV-2.
A total of 616 prospective NPS specimens were enrolled and tested in this clinical study. One
specimen was excluded due to failure to meet the inclusion criteria. Overall, 615 evaluable
specimens were included in the performance analysis.
Study demographics are summarized in Table 13.

Representative Panel Assays Equivalency
To confirm the clinical performance of the original panel assays and to demonstrate clinical
performance equivalency between the two devices (the previously cleared QIAstat-Dx
Respiratory Panel and the candidate device, QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus), a subset of
original panel analytes was chosen as a representative panel of analytes for a comparison study.
The representative panel covers all target analyte types (i.e., RNA and DNA viruses and a
bacterium). Additionally, the panel was constructed by choosing one analyte from each Reaction
Chamber within the test cartridge. The final list includes the following organisms:
1. Influenza B
2. Coronavirus OC43
3. Parainfluenza virus 3
4. Rhinovirus/enterovirus
5. Adenovirus
6. Bordetella pertussis
A total of 190 de-identified clinical NPS specimens, both positive and negative as per Standard
of Care, were obtained and tested for the representative panel analytes. Each specimen was run
in parallel on the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel and the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus.
Performance estimates were calculated using the comparator method (QIAstat-Dx Respiratory
Panel) as the reference result. The performance data, calculated in positive percent (PPA) and
negative percent agreement (NPA) are summarized in Table 15.
Clinical performance of the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel Plus demonstrated that the addition of
SARS-CoV-2 and a decrease in the lysis reagent concentration had no impact to the performance
of the original panel assays.
