B Indication(s) for Use:
8MP Color LCD Displays C811W, C811WT, PA27 and PA27T are intended for in vitro
diagnostic use to display digital images of histopathology slides acquired from IVD-labeled
whole-slide imaging scanners and viewed using IVD-labeled digital pathology image viewing
software that have been validated for use with this device. They are an aid to the pathologist to
review and interpret digital images of histopathology slides for primary diagnosis. It is the
responsibility of the pathologist to employ appropriate procedures and safeguards to assure the
validity of the interpretation of images using 8MP Color LCD Displays C811W, C811WT, PA27
and PA27T. The displays are not intended for use with digital images from frozen section,
cytology, or non-formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (non-FFPE) hematopathology specimens.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The C811WT, C811WT, PA27 and PA27T are 8MP Color LCD displays, specifically intended
for review and interpretation of surgical pathology slides from IVD-labeled whole-slide imaging
scanners that have been validated for use with the display. The displays are equipped with a 27-
inch color LCD panel with a fine pixel pitch and LED backlight panels. The built-in brightness
stabilization control circuits enable the brightness of these displays are stable throughout the
product life. Displays models C811WT and PA27T have capacitive touch screen and models
C811W, PA27 do not have a capacitive touch screen.
