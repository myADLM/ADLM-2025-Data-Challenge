IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The FaStepTM Pregnancy Rapid Test Strip and FaStepTM Pregnancy Rapid Test Midstream are
qualitative, lateral flow immunoassays for the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
in urine. The Strip format consists of a single test strip sealed in a desiccated aluminum pouch, a
urine collection cup, and a package insert. The test strip format is used by dipping the strip into a
urine sample collected into the provided collection cup. The Midstream format consists of a
single test strip assembled in a plastic housing with an absorbent tip, designed to be tested in dip
or midstream mode, sealed in a desiccated aluminum pouch, and a package insert. The
midstream format is used by placing the strip directly into the urine stream or by dipping the
strip into a urine sample collected into a clean, dry container.
B Principle of Operation:
Anti-hCG antibodies are immobilized on the test region of the strip membrane. During testing,
the hCG in urine, if present, binds to anti-hCG antibodies conjugated to colored particles. As the
urine specimen migrates along the strip by capillary action and interacts with reagents on the
membrane, the complex will be captured by the anti-hCG antibodies at the test region. If hCG is
present in the urine, a colored line appears at the Test Zone (“T”) line. If hCG is not present or
the concentration is below the sensitivity limit, no colored line appears at the Test Zone. A
colored line should always appear in the Control Zone region, indicating that the test has been
performed correctly. The FaStepTM Pregnancy Rapid Test Strip result is shown in the test region

--- Page 3 ---
of the strip and is read visually between 3 and 10 minutes. The FaStepTM Pregnancy Rapid Test
Midstream test result is read when the “red” color indicator is visualized in the heart-shaped hole
of the device. Two (2) distinct colored lines, 1 at the Test Zone and another at the Control Zone
indicate a positive test result (pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the Test Zone and only a
colored line in the Control Zone indicates a negative test result (not pregnant). Absence of a
colored line in the Control Zone, even in the presence of a colored line in the test zone, indicates
an invalid test result.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Urine samples from non-pregnant females (negative) were spiked with hCG (traceable to the 5th
WHO IS) to obtain samples with hCG concentrations of 0, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 50, 100, and
200 mIU/mL. Each sample was tested using 3 lots of the FaStepTM Pregnancy Rapid Test Strip
and the FaStepTM Pregnancy Rapid Test Midstream. Testing on the midstream format was
performed using both the instream and dip sampling methods whereas testing with the strip
format was performed only in dip sampling method. The tests were performed in replicates of
10, over the course of 5 consecutive days by 3 different operators. A total of 150 replicates were
performed per sampling method per hCG concentration. The device cut-off is 20 mIU/mL hCG.

2. Linearity:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity
The candidate device was tested using negative and hCG-positive urine samples for potential
cross-reactivity from human luteinizing hormone (LH), human follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH), and human thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Urine specimens from non-pregnant
females were pooled and used to prepare samples with hCG levels of 0, 10, and 20 mIU/mL
which were then spiked with each potential cross-reactant. Samples were tested in replicates of 3
with 3 lots of the candidate device by 3 different test operators. The results demonstrated no
cross-reactivity from LH up to 500 mIU/mL, FSH up to1000 mIU/mL, and TSH up to 1 mIU/mL
in either negative or positive urine samples.
Effect from interfering substances
To evaluate potential interference, urine specimens from non-pregnant females were pooled and
used to prepare samples with hCG levels at 0 mIU/mL 10 mIU/mL and 20 mIU/mL. The
potential interfering substance was then added to these prepared samples with concentration of 0
mIU/mL, 10 mIU/m, and 20 mIU/mL hCG, respectively. Samples were tested in replicates of 3
with 3 lots of the candidate device by 3 different operators. The test results demonstrated no
interference from substances at the concentrations shown in the table below:

Effect of urine specific gravity
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, urine samples containing
0 mIU/mL, 10 mIU/mL, and 20 mIU/mL hCG were adjusted to specific gravities of 1.000,
1.005, 1.011, 1.015, 1.019, 1.024, 1.029, and 1.035. Aliquots of each specific gravity urine
sample were spiked with hCG to concentrations of 0, 10, and 20 mIU/mL. Samples were tested
in replicates of 3 with 3 lots of the candidate device by 3 different operators. The test results
demonstrated that the performance of the candidate device is not affected by urine with specific
gravities of 1.000 to 1.035.
Effect of hCG β-core fragment:
The candidate device was tested using negative and hCG-positive urine samples with various
concentrations of hCG β-core fragment (hCGβcf). Four (4) different hCG concentrations of
female urine sample pools (0, 10, 20, and 20,000 mIU/mL) were each spiked with hCGβcf at

concentrations of 50,000, 125,000, 250,000, and 500,000 pmol/L. Samples were tested in
replicates of 3 with 3 lots of the candidate device. The test results demonstrated that the
performance of the candidate device is not affected by hCGβcf up to 500,000 pmol/L.
Effect of urine pH
To evaluate potential interference from pH, urine samples at a pH of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and
9.0 were prepared. The samples were then spiked with hCG to concentrations of 0, 10, and 20
mIU/mL. Samples were tested in replicates of 3 with 3 lots of the candidate device by 3 different
operators. The test results demonstrated that the performance of candidate device is not affected
by varying urine pH in the range of 4.0 to 9.0.
High dose hook effect study:
The candidate device was tested using negative female urine samples spiked with varying hCG
concentrations (6,250, 12,500, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, and 500,000 mIU/mL) and
tested in replicates of 5 with 3 lots of the candidate device by 3 different operators. The test
results demonstrated that there is no hook effect at hCG concentrations up to 500,000 mIU/mL.
