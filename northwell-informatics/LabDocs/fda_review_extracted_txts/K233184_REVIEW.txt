C Type of Test:
The T2Bacteria Panel, performed on the T2Dx Instrument, is a molecular diagnostic assay for the
detection of the above listed bacterial species from whole blood specimens obtained from patients
with signs and symptoms of bacterial bloodstream infections.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The T2Bacteria Panel run on the T2Dx Instrument is a qualitative T2 magnetic resonance
(T2MR) test for the direct detection of bacterial species in K2EDTA human whole blood
specimens from patients with suspected bacteremia. The T2Bacteria Panel identifies six species
of bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
The T2Bacteria Panel is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of bacteremia and results should be
used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory data. Concomitant blood cultures are
necessary to recover organisms for susceptibility testing or further identification, and for
organisms not detected by the T2Bacteria Panel.
Results from the T2Bacteria Panel are not intended to be used as the sole basis for diagnosis,
treatment, or other patient management decisions in patients with suspected bacteremia.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
• Rx - For Prescription Use Only
• The Panel has been validated for use only with whole blood collected in 4 mL tubes with
K2EDTA anticoagulant.
• An indeterminate result for E. coli cannot be considered positive or negative, and no
antimicrobial therapy decisions should be based on this result.
• Feraheme at a concentration of ≥21 µg/mL was shown to interfere with detection of
organisms with the T2Bacteria Panel. Interference by substances other than those described
in the Interfering Substances section above could lead to erroneous results.
• The following cross reactivity was noted with the T2Bacteria Panel:
E. faecium probe – Enterococcus durans;
o
E. coli probe – Escherichia albertii, Escherichia fergusonii, Shigella boydii, Shigella
o
dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei;
K. pneumoniae probe – Klebsiella variicola, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae;
o
S. aureus probe – Staphylococcus argenteus
o
• High concentrations of E. coli in the blood specimen may prevent the detection of low
concentrations of P. aeruginosa when present in the same specimen.

D Special Instrument Requirements:
The T2Bacteria Panel is performed on the T2Dx Instrument.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The T2Bacteria panel is a qualitative molecular diagnostic assay that employs a whole blood
compatible PCR amplification followed by T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR) detection. The
T2Bacteria Panel is performed on the T2Dx Instrument which executes all steps after specimen
loading including red blood cell lysis, concentration of bacterial cells, supernatant removal, lysis
of bacterial cells, amplification of bacterial DNA and detection of target specific amplicons via
hybridization to target-specific particles.
The panel includes both the T2Bacteria Cartridge and the Reagent Tray. The T2Bacteria
Cartridge contains the blood cell lysing reagent, beads, and a preservative in an aqueous solution.
Additionally, pipettes and tubes are included in the cartridge. The Reagent Tray contains the
internal control, reaction buffer, the enzyme solution (polymerase and dNTPs), and target
specific oligonucleotide probes coated in Superparamagnetic Particles.
A K EDTA whole blood specimen containing a minimum of 3 mL is loaded directly onto the
2
T2Bacteria Sample Inlet, which is then placed on the T2Bacteria Cartridge along with
the T2Bacteria Reagent Tray. The blood specimen is mixed with the red blood cell lysing reagent
and the bacterial cells are concentrated by centrifugation. The internal control is added to the
concentrated bacterial cells and is carried though the entire lysis, amplification, and detection
process. A bead-beating process lyses the bacterial cells and the supernatant containing the DNA
from the lysed bacterial cells and the internal control are amplified using the target and internal
control-specific primers. The generated amplicons are aliquoted into individual tubes for
detection of A. baumannii, E. faecium, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and the
internal control. Bacterial and internal control amplicons are hybridized to target-specific probes
attached to superparamagnetic particles; hybridization results in clustering of the particles. The
hybridization occurring in individual tubes is analyzed in the MR reader and a signal for each
target is generated and is detected by T2 Magnetic Resonance (T2MR) indicating the presence of
the target organism.
Up to seven specimens can be loaded onto the T2Dx instrument at the same time. When running
the first specimen in a series or a single specimen, the result is reported in 3.5 hours from the
time the specimen is loaded onto the instrument. The results are interpreted by the device
software as valid or invalid (based on the result of the internal control or target detections), and if
valid, results are reported as “Positive” or “Target not Detected” for each specific target. For E.
coli, results are reported as “Positive”, “Indeterminate” or “Target not Detected”. An
Indeterminate result is a valid result, but the presence or absence of E. coli in the specimen
cannot be definitively assessed.
B Principle of Operation:
During processing on the T2Dx instrument, pathogens are concentrated directly in whole blood,
then lysed to release the target DNA. Bacterial DNA is amplified with target-specific primers
and amplicons are hybridized to target-specific probes attached to superparamagnetic particles
causing clustering of the particles. A signal is detected by T2 Magnetic Resonance (T2MR)

performance for each patient sample or control.

was performed for six non-consecutive days with at least two operators per site for a total of
36 replicates per sample per site.
The reproducibility panel included A. baumannii spiked in fresh human whole blood
specimens in triple-spiked samples (A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus). (The
applicability of using multi-spiked samples was evaluated in a separate study, see below.)
Bacterial levels were confirmed by colony count testing of the original suspension used for
spiking. A total of 108 negative blood samples were included in the reproducibility panel.
Reproducibility results were acceptable with % agreement with expected results for detection
of A. baumannii. (Table 1)

2. Linearity:
Not Applicable
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
A. Cross reactivity. The cross-reactivity study for detection of A. baumannii was performed
during the initial evaluation of the T2Bacteria Panel, as described in K172708. Analytical
specificity testing was conducted to assess the cross-reactivity of the T2Bacteria Panel to
pathogens at concentrations of 103 CFU/mL for bacteria and fungi and 103 TCID for
50
viral pathogens. Species tested represented 128 different pathogenically,
phylogenetically, or environmentally relevant organisms contrived in human whole
blood. No cross reactivity was noted for any species with A. baumannii.
During in silico analysis, five Acinetobacter species, other than A. baumannii, with ≥
96% primer homology and ≥ 84% probe homology were identified. Three of these
species were tested in the cross-reactivity study and were not detected by the assay. The

remaining two species, A. seifertii and A. dijkshoorniae are rare species and were not
tested in the analytical study. As both species show low percent homology for the capture
probe, based on the in silico data, (similar to the three common Acinetobacter species
tested and shown to be not detected), it is expected that these species are unlikely to cross
react.
This cross-reactivity study was acceptable.
B. Co-infection. The co-infection study for detection of A. baumannii was performed during
the initial evaluation of the T2Bacteria Panel, as described in K172708. A competitive
inhibition study was performed to evaluate the ability of the T2Bacteria panel to detect A.
baumannii present at 1-2X LoD (low concentration) in the presence of other clinically
relevant organisms (on- and off-panel) that may be present in a co-infection. Three
combinations of organism concentrations were tested in human whole blood samples: 1)
samples containing A. baumannii and a second T2Bacteria panel target species, each at a
concentration of 1-2X LoD (low concentrations); 2) samples containing A. baumannii at
a low concentration and a second T2Bacteria target species at a concentration of 1000
CFU/mL (high concentration); and 3) samples containing A. baumannii at a low
concentration and a second non-target species at a concentration of 1000 CFU/mL.
Testing was performed using four lots of T2Bacteria Cartridges and three lots of reagent
trays.
On-panel targets. Samples containing A. baumannii in a low concentration were tested
with low and high concentrations of the following on-panel species: E. coli, E. faecium,
K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. A. baumannii was detected in all samples.
Off-panel targets. Samples containing A. baumannii in a low concentration were tested
with high concentrations of the following off-panel species: Staphylococcus epidermidis,
Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus salivarius,
Enterobacter cloacae and Candida albicans. A. baumannii was detected in all samples.
The co-infection studies were acceptable for the detection of A. baumannii.
C. Interfering substances. The interfering substances study for detection of A. baumannii
was performed during the initial evaluation of the T2Bacteria Panel, as described in
K172708. The study was performed to determine and characterize the effects of potential
endogenous and exogenous interfering substances commonly found in blood on the
performance of the T2Bacteria panel for detection of A. baumannii. Interferents were
screened as pools of interferents in human blood samples; potential interferents were
added in high concentrations to represent worst case scenarios; samples were tested in
triplicate. Samples were inoculated with A. baumannii at a concentration of 2-3X LoD
and samples without interferents were included as controls. Pooled interferents that
caused a difference in signal when compared to a sample without interferents were
further analyzed individually in blood samples.
Evaluation of potential endogenous substances included the following 13 substances:
human DNA (buffy coat), bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), elevated ALT/AST,
hemoglobin, intralipid (to mimic triglycerides), albumin/IgG, creatinine/urea, circulating
K233184 - Page 7 of 13

--- Page 8 ---
human DNA, and lactoferrin. None of the endogenous substances tested showed
interference with the detection of A. baumannii with the T2Bacteria panel.
A total of 28 potentially interfering substances were tested at high concentrations.
Potential interferents included the following substances: EDTA, Feraheme, heparin,
iopamidol, MRI contrast agent (gadopentetate dimeglumine), dexamethasone, lisinopril,
cytarabine, amphotericin B trihydrate, caspofungin, fluconazole, metronidazole,
micafungin, ampicillin, azithromycin, cefazolin (sodium salt), cefepime hydrochloride,
cefoxitin sodium salt, ceftazidime pentahydrate, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, gentamycin
sulfate, imipenem/cilastatin, linezolid, meropenem trihydrate, piperacillin, tazobactam,
vancomycin. None of the above exogenous interferents affected the detection of A.
baumannii. However, concentrations of Feraheme at ≥21 μg/mL were previously shown
to interfere with the performance of the T2Bacteria Panel in K172708. The interference
of Feraheme with the T2Bacteria Panel was noted as a limitation in the device labeling.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The quality control for establishment of the clinical sensitivity of the T2Bacteria panel for
detection of A. baumannii was performed during the initial evaluation of the T2Bacteria
Panel, as described in K172708. The T2Bacteria Panel utilizes two types of controls, the
internal control and the external controls. The Internal Control (IC) is automatically
introduced into each specimen during sample processing on the T2Dx instrument and is
carried through the lysis, amplification and detection steps of the assay. The IC monitors the
amplification and detection process and monitors for the presence of inhibitors in the
specimen.
The external controls include the QCheck Positive Kit and the QCheck Negative Kit. The
QCheck Positive Kit contains two sample blends of bacterial species, the ASaKp Positive
Control (which contains cells of A. baumannii, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae) and the
EcPaEfm Positive Control (which contains cells of E. coli, P. aeruginosa and E. faecium)
suspended in a buffer-based solution. These positive controls individually interrogate the
respective, complementary probe-coated particles in the detection reactions. Results for the
positive controls are reported for only the detection channels for species included in the
control. The QCheck Negative Kit contains vials of a buffer-based solution which are used to
detect contamination of the T2Bacteria regents or the instrument. Results of the negative
control are reported for all six detection channels.
QC testing for prospective arm and contrived arm for A. baumannii
At least one Positive and one Negative EC were run at each site on each instrument that was
utilized for each day of testing. The QCheck testing with both positive and negative samples
was required to pass prior to use of the T2Dx on that day.
A total of 430 results were obtained with the ASaKp positive control during the clinical
study. The positivity rate was 99.3% with a 95% confidence interval 97.9% to 99.8%.
QCheck Negative controls also passed with 99.0% accuracy.
K233184 - Page 8 of 13

--- Page 9 ---
Additional A. baumannii testing
For each day of testing, each T2Dx device had a positive and negative QCheck sample run.
Along with daily QCheck testing, additional QCheck Positive-AbSaKp testing was
conducted to produce 20 test results with this control.
Testing of 20 QCheck Positive–AbSaKp controls resulted in a pass result for all samples
(100% detection), which would indicate that A. baumannii was detected in all control
samples. All QCheck Negative controls also passed, indicating no false positive or invalid
results with these samples.
6. Detection Limit:
The detection limit study for detection of A. baumannii was performed during the initial
evaluation of the T2Bacteria Panel, as described in K172708. Limit of detection (LoD)
testing was performed using two strains of A. baumannii inoculated into human whole blood.
The determination of the LoD included an initial screening phase and a confirmatory phase.
In the initial phase, triple spiked samples were prepared at (1, 3, 9 and 10 CFU/mL) and a
preliminary LoD was identified. (The applicability of using multi-spiked samples was
evaluated in a separate study, see below). The preliminary LoD for A. baumannii was
confirmed using two reagent lots and was determined to be 9 CFU/mL for Strain 1 and 3
CFU/mL for Strain 2.
To confirm the preliminary LoD, a minimum of 20 replicates of both strains of each species
was tested at increasing concentrations until a positivity rate of 95% was achieved. A
minimum of 20 replicates of both strains of A. baumannii were tested. Strain 1 was tested at
both 3 CFU/mL and 9 CFU/mL. The LoD of Strain 2 was confirmed at 3 CFU/mL based on
the results of the preliminary and replicate testing. The overall LoD was confirmed to be 3
CFU/ml for A. baumannii.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay cut-off study for detection of A. baumannii was performed during the initial
evaluation of the T2Bacteria Panel, as described in K172708. To establish the limit of blank
(LoB) and cut-off values for the A. baumannii target, negative blood specimens from healthy
donors and blood specimens from patients suspected of bacteremia were tested using
multiple instruments and reagent lots across multiple days. T2MR signals were evaluated to

establish the upper limit of the signal distribution for negative samples; the T2MR signal
values encompassing ≥99% of all signals from negative samples was determined to be the
LoB.
The assay cut-off values were determined for A. baumannii using spiked positive samples;
the lower limit of the signal distribution for the A. baumannii target channel and for the
internal control measurements determined the assay cut-off. The established cut-off was
reevaluated utilizing data obtained with contrived samples evaluated during the clinical study
to validate the cut-off with a larger specimen pool; analysis verified the cut-off for A.
baumannii to be 130 milliseconds (ms). The cut-off value was established to produce ≥
95.6% specificity and ≥ 90.0% sensitivity.
8. Single species spike, multi-species spike equivalence
The single species/multi species spike equivalency study for detection of A. baumannii was
performed during the initial evaluation of the T2Bacteria Panel, as described in K172708. A
comparison of the equivalence of the T2MR signal results obtained for human blood samples
spiked with a single bacterial species vs. samples spiked with three bacterial species was
performed to determine the applicability of testing multiple species in a single blood
specimen for the analytical studies. Testing was conducted in healthy donor blood at 1–2X
LoD and 3-4X LoD for each species.
Results obtained using a single strain of A. baumannii were compared to results obtained
from samples spiked with the combination of A. baumannii/K. pneumoniae/S. aureus.
Signals obtained from samples containing the single-spiked samples of A. baumannii gave
signals equivalent to the signals obtained from the multi-spiked samples.
9. Analytical Sensitivity/Inclusivity
The inclusivity study for detection of A. baumannii was performed during the initial
evaluation of the T2Bacteria Panel, as described in K172708. A total of 14 A. baumannii
isolates were evaluated for inclusivity in the T2Bacterial panel. Isolates were selected to
represent variations in antimicrobial resistance, as well as phylogenic, temporal, and
geographic diversity (Table 3). Isolates were inoculated into human whole blood at a
concentration of 2-3X LoD; testing of each sample was performed in triplicate. For 12/13
samples, the three replicates gave positive results for A. baumannii. For 1/13 samples, two of
the three replicates gave positive results for A. baumannii; repeat testing with 20 replicates of
this strain gave positive results for all replicates.

1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The evaluation of the clinical sensitivity of the T2Bacteria panel for detection of A.
baumannii was performed during the initial evaluation of the T2Bacteria Panel, as described
in K172708. The performance of A. baumannii on the T2Bacteria Panel was evaluated at
eleven sites within the US and results were compared to standard of care (SOC) blood
culture. Patients were enrolled prospectively, and two paired sample collections were
obtained from each patient, one for blood culture and one for testing by the T2Bacteria Panel.
Three FDA cleared blood culture systems were used in the study. The T2Bacteria Panel A.
baumannii result was compared against results from standards of care identification methods
for Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA). A total of
1,427 samples were tested prospectively. There were no blood samples that tested positive
for A. baumannii by standard of care methods during the prospective arm. However, there
were 13 positives detected by the T2Bacteria panel, for an NPA of 99.1% (1414/1427). Of
these 13 potential false positive results, one was positive for A. baumannii by an
amplification and gene sequencing.
Due to the low prevalence of positive blood cultures for A. baumannii, evaluation of the
T2Bacteria panel was performed using contrived samples. Contrived sample testing was
performed at three clinical sites. A total of 50 A. baumannii-spiked contrived samples and 50
negative samples were prepared using human whole blood specimens collected in K EDTA
2
tubes from healthy adults that were verified to be negative for A. baumannii. Each contrived
sample was prepared using a single unique A. baumannii strain; a total of 50 unique strains
were tested at concentrations within the following ranges: <1 CFU/mL, 1 – 10 CFU/mL, 11-
30 CFU/mL and 31-100 CFU/mL.

2. Clinical Specificity:
Based on the observed A. baumannii false positive results during the prospective arm of the
clinical testing, several manufacturing and facility process changes and improvements were
made.
Following these changes, healthy donor blood testing with the T2Bacteria Panel was
performed to evaluate the specificity of the panel for A. baumannii when testing negative
blood samples. Data was retrospectively collected from QC clean testing of T2Bacteria Panel
reagents with negative blood samples. A total of 980 valid T2Bacteria results from the
analysis of ten different lots of reagents that were tested between February 2022 through
March 2023 were analyzed. Two (2) lots had a single A. baumannii false positive each for an
overall positivity of 0.2%.
In addition, thirty-three unique strains of Acinetobacter baumannii were spiked individually
into human whole blood at 2-3x LoD (6-9 CFU/ml). All samples were tested within 24 hours
of production and were stored at 2-8ºC until tested. Testing was conducted over nine (9)
days, across four (4) different T2Dx devices, using two (2) lots of cartridges, two (2) lots of
reagents and blood from five (5) unique donors.
Results from testing thirty-three (33) unique strains of A. baumannii demonstrate 97.0%
(32/33) positive detection (Table 5). One strain was not detected by the T2Bacteria Panel.
Ten (10) additional samples were produced with this strain and tested with the T2Bacteria
Panel. From this testing, one (1) of ten (10) samples were detected. This data suggests that
the T2Bacteria Panel may be able to detect this strain, but sensitivity is substantially reduced.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Based on FDA review of the observed E. coli and P. aeruginosa channel false positive
results described in K172708, the T2Bacteria Panel labeling included a warning indicating
that any E. coli and P. aeruginosa positive detection result should be presented with a

statement concerning the potential for false positive results. Several manufacturing and
facility process changes and improvements were made to reduce the false positive rate.
After implementation of these changes, data was retrospectively collected from QC clean
testing of T2Bacteria Panel reagents with negative blood samples. Analysis consisted of 980
valid T2Bacteria Panel results from analysis of 10 different lots of reagents that were tested
between February 2022 and March 2023. Testing demonstrated five (5) lots had a single E.
coli false positive for an overall E. coli false-positivity rate of 0.5%. The other five lots
demonstrated no false positive results. This performance is acceptable and supported the
removal of the warning regarding the risk of false positives for E. coli. Testing demonstrated
three (3) lots out of ten (10) had a P. aeruginosa false positive (one lot has two (2) false
positives) for a total of four (4) false positives and an overall P. aeruginosa false-positivity
rate of 0.4%. This performance is acceptable and supported the removal of the warning
regarding the risk of false positives for P. aeruginosa.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not Applicable
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
In the prospective clinical study submitted as part of K172708, a total of 1427 paired blood
cultures and T2Bacteria specimens were evaluated. There was a total of 36 positive blood
cultures and 199 positive T2Bacteria results. Positive T2Bacteria results were evaluated as noted
above.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
