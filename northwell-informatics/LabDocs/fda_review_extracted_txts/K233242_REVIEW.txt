III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Atellica® CH High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein 2 (hCRP2) assay is for in vitro diagnostic
use in the quantitative determination of the concentration of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in human
serum and plasma (lithium heparin, sodium heparin or K2 EDTA) on the Atellica® CH
Analyzer.
Measurements from Atellica® High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein 2 (hCRP2) may be used as an
aid in identification of individuals at risk for future cardiovascular disease. Measurement of
hCRP2, when used in conjunction with traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute
coronary syndromes, may be useful as an independent marker of prognosis for recurrent events
in patients with stable coronary disease or acute coronary syndromes.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Atellica® CH Analyzer, K151767
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Atellica® CH High Sensitivity C‐Reactive Protein 2 (hCRP2) assay includes two ready‐to‐
use reagent packs consisting of 23.1mL Phosphate buffer, polidocanol (1.9g/L), and sodium
azide (0.1%) in Pack 1 and 12.3mL Mouse anti‐CRP monoclonal antibodies (13mg/L),
polystyrene particles (1g/L), human albumin (0.05%) and sodium azide (<0.1%) in Pack 2. This
product consists of two (2) kits consisting of 360 tests each for a total of 720 tests.

B Principle of Operation:
Polystyrene particles coated with monoclonal antibodies specific to human CRP are aggregated
when mixed with samples containing CRP. These aggregates scatter a beam of light passed
through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the
respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of known
concentration.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed according to CLSI EP05‐A3. Repeatability and within‐lab
precision were evaluated by testing five native serum samples and one quality control sample
in duplicate twice per day for twenty days using three lots of the candidate device. Results
from multiple lots were similar with results from one representative lot provided in the table
below:

Reproducibility was evaluated using three pooled serum samples and three quality control
samples assayed with five replicates per run for five days using three instruments and three
reagent lots. The data was analyzed to calculate the following components of precision:
repeatability, between‐day, between‐lot, between‐instrument, and reproducibility (total). The
results are shown below.

distributed across the analytical measuring range was prepared by mixing the high and low
samples. Measurements were made in replicates of five per level using three reagent lots.
The linearity study results support that the assay is linear across the claimed reportable range
from 0.16 to 9.50 mg/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP07-ED3. Testing of
hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia was conducted comparing a sample spiked with interferent to
a sample spiked with control material. Three replicates were tested. Percent interference was
calculated. Interference is defined as a bias >10% when compared to the control sample. The
results are summarized in the table below:
Substance Highest concentration tested that did
not show significant interference
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL
Conjugated Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Unconjugated Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Lipemia (from Intralipid®) 3000 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 500 IU/mL
CRP (high sensitivity) prozone study:
A study was performed to verify the CRP prozone performance. Samples were created using
saline-diluted spiking material and tested in singlicate using one reagent lot. Results support
that levels as high as 1300.00 mg/L will report > 9.50 mg/L. The labeling states: “High
C‑reactive protein levels can cause a paradoxical decrease in signal as a result of the
high‑dose hook effect. In the Atellica® CH hCRP2 assay, C‑reactive protein levels as high as
1300.00 mg/L will read > 9.50 mg/L.”
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay’s reportable range is 0.16 mg/L to 9.50 mg/L.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The assay is traceable to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory
Medicine (IFCC) reference material ERM‐DA474/IFCC.
Sample stability
A study was conducted to verify sample stability with the candidate device. The results
support the sponsor’s sample stability claims that serum, sodium heparin plasma, lithium
heparin plasma, and potassium EDTA plasma can be stored at Room Temperature (18‐26 °C)
for up to 26 hours, refrigerated (2‐8 °C) for up to 188 hours and Frozen (‐20 °C) for up to 2
years.

6. Detection Limit:
Detection capability was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17‐A2.
The Limit of Blank (LoB) corresponds to the highest value expected in a series of results on
a sample that contains no analyte. LoB was determined using six blank samples, 5 lots of
Atellica CH diluent (saline) and 1 lot of 6% BSA, tested using three reagent lots on one
instrument in replicates of five for three days, for 90 measurements per reagent lot and a total
of 270 blank measurements.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) is the lowest concentration of c‐reactive protein that can be
detected with a probability of 95%. LoD was determined using five separate human serum
samples, diluted with Atellica CH diluent targeted to 0.05 mg/L, tested using three reagent
lots on one instrument in replicates of five for three days, for 75 measurements per reagent
lot and a total of 225 low level measurements.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is the lowest concentration of c‐reactive protein that met the
required analyte level but did not reach 20% CV. LoQ was determined using five separate
human serum samples, diluted with Atellica CH diluent targeted to approximately 0.16 mg/L,
tested using three reagent lots on one instrument in replicates of five for five days.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were conducted based on CLSI EP09c. One‐hundred native
serum samples that ranged from 0.26 - 9.41 mg/L CRP were tested with the candidate device
and the predicate device. A single replicate was tested and processed for each sample on both
systems. The method comparison study was evaluated by weighted Deming regression
analysis. The regression analysis is summarized below:

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed to demonstrate the equivalence between serum
and plasma samples when measuring CRP using the candidate device. Matched native human
serum and plasma (Sodium Heparin, K2 EDTA and Lithium Heparin) samples were tested in
singlicate on the Atellica® CH Analyzer. Sixty samples were tested across the assay range.
Five samples fell outside the measuring range (three below, two above) with fifty-five total
samples remaining. The results were analyzed using Deming regression with the following
results.
