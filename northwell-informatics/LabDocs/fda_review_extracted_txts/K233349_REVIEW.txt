Interpretation of Results:
The Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay is a qualitative assay. For each analyte (HSV-1, HSV-2
or VZV) signal, the amplification CN (Cycle Number) is determined when the fluorescent signal
is detected by the Alinity m System. Each signal is either reported as “Positive” if the CN is less
than or equal to a fixed assay cutoff cycle for that signal or is reported as “Negative” if the CN is
not generated, or the CN is greater than the assay cutoff cycle. The Alinity m System will
automatically report a result and interpretation for each specimen. If applicable a message code
or flag will be displayed.

B Principle of Operation:
Patient sample is dispensed into the Alinity m System which automates running of the assay and
result reporting.
The Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay utilizes real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to
amplify and differentiate Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1), Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2)
and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) DNA extracted from cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesion
specimens. The steps of Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay consist of sample preparation, PCR
assembly, amplification/detection, and result calculation and reporting. All stages of the Alinity
m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay procedure are executed automatically by the Alinity m System. .
Assay controls are tested at or above an established minimum frequency to help ensure that
instrument and reagent performance remain satisfactory. During each control event, a negative
control and a positive control are processed through sample preparation and PCR procedures that
are identical to those used for specimens. Assay controls are used to demonstrate proper sample
processing and assay validity.
The Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV amplification reagents include primers and probes that amplify
and detect an exogenous internal control (containing plasmid DNA). Amplification and detection

of the internal control demonstrates proper sample processing. The internal control is used to
demonstrate assay validity.
Results are reported as positive or negative based on the cycle number (CN) output for each
target (HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, and IC), which is based on threshold cycle (Ct) at which the
fluorescent signal surpasses a threshold to indicate the detection target nucleic acids.
The Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay is a dual target assay for HSV-1 and HSV-2, and a single
target assay for VZV. Identification of HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV occurs by the target-specific
primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that hybridize to conserved regions in the viral genomes.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:

1a. Within-Laboratory Precision:
The Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay within-laboratory Precision was evaluated by testing
a 4-member precision panel consisting of 4 target levels (Moderate Positive, Low Positive,
Sub-LoD, and Negative) for each assay analyte. The positive panel members were prepared
by spiking HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV stocks into negative matrix to achieve the targeted level
of Moderate Positive (3X LoD), Low Positive (1X to 2X LoD), and High Negative (<1X
LoD). Each panel member was tested with 3 replicates in a run, 2 runs on each of 5 days, on
3 Alinity m Systems operated by 3 operators (one operator per system), using 3 Alinity m
HSV 1 & 2 / VZV AMP Kit lots (one lot per system) for a total of 90 replicates of each panel
member. The precision results for HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV are summarized below in Table

1b. Reproducibility Study (multi-site precision):
The reproducibility of the Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay was evaluated by testing a 4 -
member panel, including a 5X LoD (Positive), 1-2X LoD (Low Positive), <1X LoD (High
Negative), and Negative panel member. The positive panel members were prepared by
spiking cultured viral particles HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV into the negative matrix.
A total of 3 Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV kit lots were used for the reproducibility study.
Each of external sites used 2 different lots of reagent kits and a different Alinity m system.
Six replicates of each panel member were tested with 3 reagent lots at 3 external sites on 5
non-consecutive days (6 replicates x 2 kit lots/site x 3 sites x 5 days = 180). The
reproducibility results of the Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay for HSV-1, HSV-2, and
VZV are presented below in Table 4.

b. Microbial Interference Study:
The microbial interference study was performed with a list of microorganisms listed
above in the Table 5 for the Cross Reactivity Study.
Each potentially interfering microorganism was tested in the presence of 3X LoD levels
for each analyte e.g., HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV viruses spiked into negative matrix. All
positive samples reported positive results for HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV in the presence of
these microorganisms. There was no interference observed with the 55 microorganisms
tested with the Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV Assay.
c. Interfering Substances:
The performance of the Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay was evaluated with potentially
interfering endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in cutaneous or
mucocutaneous lesion specimens. A panel composed of twenty -four (24) substances
listed in Table 6 was tested in the absence or presence of HSV-1, HSV-2, or VZV (Isolate
2, G strain, Ellen strain, respectively) viruses at 3X LOD in the Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 /
VZV assay. There was no evidence of interference (false positive or false negative
results) caused by the substances tested at the concentrations shown below in Table 6.

d. Competitive Interference: A competitive interference study was performed to evaluate the
performance of the Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay in the presence of the 3 target
analytes. Each sample was prepared with 2 of the analytes (HSV-1, HSV-2 or VZV
viruses) at 3X LoD and the third analyte at 1000X LoD in negative simulated swab
matrix.
The three Panel Members (PM) were evaluated as follow:
• PM 1: HSV-1 and HSV-2 at 3X LoD and VZV at 1000X LoD
• PM 2: HSV-1 and VZV at 3X LoD and HSV-2 at 1000X LoD
• PM 3: HSV-2 and VZV at 3X LoD and HSV-1 at 1000X LoD
Across panel members, all replicates at the low concentration were detected for each of
the 3 analytes. None of the analyte targets present at the high concentration interfered
with the detection of the other 2 analyte targets at low levels. Results are presented below
in Table7.

6. Limit of Detection:
The limit of detection (LoD) for Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay for each analyte were
determined by quantified (TCID50/mL) cultures of HSV-1 (Maclntyre), HSV-2 (MS) or
VZV (Ellen) viral strains diluted into pooled negative clinical swab specimens. The LoD was
established in 2 phases as follows:
Phase 1: LoD Range Finding - A dilution series was made from viral stocks of HSV-1, HSV-
2 and VZV into negative clinical matrix (CM). For each panel member (PM), a total of 72
replicates of each dilution (panel member) were tested across 3 Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV
AMP Kit lots and 3 Alinity m Systems (one lot per system) over 3 days (8 replicates x 3 days
x 3 instruments/lot = 72 replicates per each panel member).
Phase 2: LoD Confirmation – The LoD determined for each analyte from Phase I Study was
further confirmed in negative clinical matrix. For each target analyte, a total of 32 replicates
of each PM in clinical negative matrix were tested across 2 Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV
AMP kit lots and 2 Alinity m Systems, with each lot of reagents assigned to a specific
instrument. A total of 16 replicates were tested for each PM on each of the 2 instrument/lot
pair, resulting in a total of 32 replicates per PM (16 replicates × 2 instrument/lot = 32
replicates per PM).
Probit analysis of the data determined that the concentration detected with 95% probability
(LoD by Probit) for HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV was 5.90 TCID50/mL, 2.07 TCID50/mL, and
0.055 TCID50/mL respectively shown below in Table 8.
Table 8. Limit of Detection
Analyte Analyte LoD Concentration
Strain (TCID /mL)

HSV-1 Maclntyre 5.90
HSV-2 MS 2.07
VZV Ellen 0.055
7. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
Analytical reactivity or inclusivity of the Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay was further
evaluated by functional testing of clinically relevant strains/isolates, in addition to those
strains used in the LoD study. The inclusivity for the Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay
was determined by testing 5 HSV-1 strains/isolates, 3 HSV-2 strains/isolates and 5 VZV
strains/isolates. The strains whose reported units of measure were in TCID /mL, were
50
diluted to a concentration ≤3X LoD. For strains where concentration in TCID /mL was not

8. Carry-Over:
The carry-over rate for Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay was determined by testing 360
alternating replicates of negative and high-positive samples. High positive samples
consisted of HSV-2 DNA targeted to a CN value of 10.00. The testing was performed
across 3 different Alinity m Systems. All negative samples reported negative
interpretations, resulting in an overall carry-over rate of 0.0% (0/360, 95% CI: 0.0%,
1.1%).
9. Fresh/Frozen Specimen Stability
Study 1: Fresh/frozen specimen stability was evaluated by testing a panel member (PM)
targeted to 2X LoD for HSV-1 and HSV-2 and 1.13X LoD for VZV prepared in pooled
negative clinical specimens using Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay reagents and the
Alinity m System. The PM was tested immediately (control condition) and after 1 freeze-
thaw (FT1) and 3 freeze-thaw ( FT2) test conditions. The PM were frozen at -70°C and
thawed at 5°C± 3°C for at least 1 hr before testing. A total of 40 replicates were tested for
each PM at each storage condition. The study results support that HSV-1/HSV-2/VZV
positive panel member are stable undergoing 3 freeze/thaw cycles prior to testing shown
below in Table 10.

Study 2: Fresh/frozen specimen stability was evaluated by testing panel members (PMs)
prepared in pooled negative clinical specimens using Alinity m System. The PMs were
prepared by spiking HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV virus stock into pooled negative clinical
specimens to achieve the targeted final concentration of 4X Limit of Detection (LoD) for the
respective analytes for Panel Member 1, 100X LoD for Panel Member 2, and 1000X LoD for
Panel Member 3. All 3 targets (HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV) were spiked together in a given PM.
For PM1, a total of 20 replicates were tested at each condition. For PM2 and PM3, a total
of 10 replicates were tested at each condition. Negative clinical matrix was prepared by
pooling HSV-1/HSV-2/VZV negative clinical swab specimens. The concentrations of PM for
each analyte are listed below in Table 11.
Table 11. Target Concentration of the Panel Member
The panel members were tested at the following storage conditions:
• Control Conditions: Not frozen or thawed before testing (Fresh)
• Test Conditions: 3 freeze/thaws (frozen at -700C or colder for 24 hours, thawed at 50C
+ 30C for a minimum of 1 hour, repeat 3X before testing.

10. Specimen Storage/Onboard Stability Study: Storage conditions and on-board stability of
HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV clinical swab specimens were evaluated by 2 different studies:
Study 1 – Specimen Stability Study with Pooled Negative Clinical Matrix: The study was
executed by spiking HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV in clinical swab matrix that was prepared by
pooling HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV negative specimens followed by testing with the Alinity
m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay at the following storage conditions.
Specimen Storage/Onboard Stability conditions evaluated:
• 20°C ±5°C for 35, 61, 91, and 99 days
• 2°C to 8°C for 4.4, 5.5, 8.8, and 15.5 days
• 26°C for 1.1, 2.2, and 4.4 days
• 30°C for 2.2, 3.3 and 4.4 days
The positive specimens were prepared by spiking all three targets at a concentration of 3X
LoD in pooled negative clinical matrix. A minimum of 5 replicates for each specimen were
evaluated for each control condition (baseline), test conditions, and at different timepoints
and temperature. The study was conducted using 1 lot of reagent kit and 1 lot of control kit
reagent.
Data supported specimen stability storage at ˗20°C ±5°C for 99 days, and at 2°C to 8°C for
up to 15 days and at 26°C for 1 day.

Study 2 - Specimen Stability Study with individual clinical swab samples: The study was
executed by spiking HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV in individual negative clinical swab matrix
rather than a pooled HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV negative specimens followed by testing with
the Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay at the storage conditions indicated below. This study
represents the actual use of the test.
Ten positive samples were prepared by spiking each analyte from positive patient specimen
to a target concentration of 3X LoD in individual negative clinical swab specimens.
Replicates of spiked specimens were tested immediately (control condition or baseline) and
specimen stability conditions (test conditions) described as follows:
• Baseline (Control Condition)
• Specimens stored for 2.2 days at 26°C + storage-on board for 4 hrs.
• Specimens stored 4.4 days at 26°C + storage-on board for 4 hrs.
Ten replicates for each condition were tested. For each analyte (HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV) a
total of 34 results were generated in the study. There were 4 valid control results and 30 valid
sample results included in the analyses for each analyte. All positive samples for each analyte
were tested 100% positive. The results support that individual specimens are stable at
26°C±1°C for 4 days and Onboard for 4 hours.
Based on Study 1 and Study 2, the data supports the following specimen storage
conditions:
• 15°C to 25°C (4 days)
• 2°C to 8°C (14 days)
• -25°C to -15°C (90 days)
• -70°C or colder (90 days)
10. Comparison Studies:
a. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
See Section B Clinical Studies 3 below.
b. Matrix Equivalency Study:
i). Equivalency between Clinical Swab Matrix and Simulated Swab Matrix:
The matrix equivalency was established between clinical swab matrix (CM) and simulated
swab matrix (SM) for the Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay. Four panel members for each
analyte were prepared by spiking with HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV stock to achieve the targeted
level at 3X LoD, 1X LoD, <1X LoD, <0.1X LoD. For each target analyte, a total of 32
replicates of each PM in each matrix were tested across 2 Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV AMP
kit lots and 2 Alinity m Systems, with each lot of reagents assigned to a specific instrument.
For each matrix, a total of 16 replicates were tested for each PM on each of the 2
instrument/lot pair, resulting in a total of 32 replicates per PM (16 replicates × 2
instrument/lot = 32 replicates per PM).
K233349 - Page 18 of 25

--- Page 19 ---
The data supports that the simulated swab matrix (SM) is found to be equivalent to the
clinical swab matrix (CM).
ii). Compatibility between Transport Media (Swab) and Simulated swab matrix:
The study was conducted for transport media compatibility and simulated swab matrix
equivalency. The samples were prepared as follow:
1) Remel M4RT: Thirty (30) samples were tested in duplicate for a total of 60 replicates.
All 30 samples were prepared by pooling 2 or 3 individual clinical specimens. Pooling
was performed to ensure there was enough volume per sample for duplicate testing and
for any potential repeat testing needed due to invalid results. Each of the 30 samples was
spiked with HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV stock to achieve the targeted final concentration of
3X LOD.
2) COPAN UTM/BD UTV media: Thirty (30) samples were tested in duplicate for a total of
60 replicates. Out of these 30 samples, 8 samples were individual clinical specimens, and
the remaining 22 samples were prepared by pooling 2 individual specimens. Pooling was
performed to ensure that there was enough volume per sample for duplicate testing and
for any potential repeat testing needed due to invalid results. Each of the 30 samples was
spiked with HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV stock to achieve the approximate targeted final
concentration of 3X LOD.
3) Simulated Swab Matrix (SM) was spiked with HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV stock to achieve
the approximate targeted final concentration of 3X LOD. For each matrix, a total of 60
replicates were tested. The results demonstrated that the performance of Alinity m HSV 1
& 2 / VZV assay is equivalent in Remel M4RT, COPAN UTM/BD UTV and Simulated
Swab Matrix. The results demonstrated that the Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay is
equivalent in Remel M4RT, COPAN UTM/BD UTV, and simulated swab matrix. Results
are presented below in Table 13.

B. Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
2. Clinical Specificity:
Not applicable
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Performance characteristics of the Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay were established in
prospective and retrospective clinical studies conducted in the United States.
The swab specimens for prospective and retrospective studies were categorized as cutaneous
(eg, skin lesion), mucocutaneous (eg, anorectal, vaginal/cervical, and oral lesion), and
uncategorized (lesion type could not be determined).
The clinical performance of the Alinity m HSV 1 & 2 / VZV assay was established by
comparing to an FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT 1). For specimens with
discordant results between Alinity m and NAAT 1, testing with another FDA-cleared nucleic
acid test (NAAT 2) was performed. Results of testing on discordant samples were not
included in the analysis of device performance and are considered for information purposes
only.
Prospective Clinical Study #1
The multicenter, prospective clinical study was conducted using swab specimens from
lesions (including cutaneous and mucocutaneous) of symptomatic individuals suspected of
HSV-1, HSV-2, and/or VZV infection at geographically diverse locations in the US. All
lesion swab specimens were prospectively collected in BD UVT, COPAN UTM, or Remel
M4RT collection media. The subjects were male and female individuals of all ages, including
pediatric and geriatric populations ages >1 to <90 years.
A total of 1,257 prospective specimens (1017 fresh + 240 frozen) were included for each
analyte (HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV), for clinical performance analysis, excluding 1 sample
that did not have complete history information.
The gender and age demographics for each category are listed below in Table 14.

Retrospective Clinical Study #2
The retrospective study was conducted using archived, leftover lesion swab specimens from
routine clinical testing, collected from male and female individuals of all ages, including
pediatric and geriatric populations ages >1 to <90 years. All lesion swab specimens were
previously collected in BD UVT, COPAN UTM, or Remel M4RT collection media per
standard of care. One lesion swab specimen was obtained from each individual.
A total of 411 specimens were included in the clinical performance analysis that had results
for at least one of the analytes (410 results for HSV-1, 410 results for HSV-2, and 411 results
for VZV).
The gender and age demographics for each category are listed below in Table 16.
