See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The iDart Lyme IgG ImmunoBlot Kit is an immunoblot assay intended for the in vitro
qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi infection in human serum. The
iDart Lyme IgG ImmunoBlot Kit is intended to detect antibodies to LSA and multiple other B.
burgdorferi antigens following a modified two-tier test methodology. Positive results from the
iDart Lyme IgG ImmunoBlot Kit are supportive evidence for the presence of antibodies and
exposure to B. burgdorferi. Negative results do not preclude infection with B. burgdorferi. iDart
Lyme IgG ImmunoBlot Kit is intended to aid in the diagnosis of Lyme disease and the test kit
should only be used on samples from patients with clinical history, signs and symptoms
consistent with Lyme disease. The iDart Lyme IgG ImmunoBlot Kit is not intended as a screen
for asymptomatic patients.
Test results are to be used in conjunction with information obtained from the patient’s clinical
evaluation and other diagnostic procedures.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The iDart Lyme IgG ImmunoBlot is a line immunoblot assay. Antigenic proteins specific for
different Borrelia species that cause Lyme Disease are produced by recombinant DNA
technology in Escherichia coli. The purified proteins are then applied as discrete lines on a
nitrocellulose membrane along with two control proteins.
The recombinant proteins are applied to the nitrocellulose membrane (test strip) of the iDart
Lyme IgG ImmunoBlot Kit in the following order: Control 1 (C1: IgG/IgM), Control 2 (C2:
Protein L), P93, P41, P39, P23, P31, P66, P58, P45, P34, P30, P28, P18 and LSA (a chimeric
VlsE peptide termed the Lyme Screening Antigen).

K233367 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
During the test procedure, human serum is added to the test strip. Antibodies to Borrelia
burgdorferi, if present, will bind to antigen lines on the test strip. After removing serum and
unbound antibodies by washing, the test strip is incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated
anti-human IgG antibody for detection of IgG antibodies.
After removing the alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody by washing, the antigen-antibody
complex is visualized as bands on the test strip by adding the alkaline phosphatase substrate 5-
Bromo, 4-chloro, 3-indolylphosphate (BCIP) and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) to form a blue-
purple precipitate on the detected band(s). The reaction is stopped by washing the test strip with
distilled or deionized water. A test strip reading guide included with the kit shows the location of
specific antigens in the test strip (C1 and C2). Every test strip has two functional control bands.
The test strip is only valid when both controls bands are visible after completion of the test. Any
band found having a visual intensity equal to or greater than the C2 control band intensity is
considered as a positive band.

Quality Controls
Control material should be tested in accordance with the guidelines or requirements of local,
state, and/or federal regulations or accrediting organizations. To monitor the assay, reagent
performance and day-to-day variation, positive controls for anti-Borrelia antibodies along with a
negative control must be tested with each run.
1. The positive and negative control strips of the run must be comparable to their previously
established profiles due to subjectivity in reading.
2. All reportable bands should be present on positive control strip. If any of the reportable bands
are absent on positive control, the test must be repeated.
3. If the negative control strip shows 2 or more reportable bands with intensity equal to or
greater than 1+, the test must be repeated.
4. C1 and C2 control bands must show in every test strip.
Interpretation of Results
A test strip result is valid only if both internal controls bands (C1 and C2) are clearly visible, and
the negative and positive serum controls results are comparable to the preestablished profiles.
Within each strip, C2 is the benchmark calibrator for test bands.
The intensity of the bands on the sample test strip is then scored by comparing the intensity of
the reportable bands to the intensity of C2 band within the same strip.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility: The reproducibility of the iDart Lyme IgG ImmunoBlot Kit was
evaluated in a study that included six anti-Borrelia IgG human serum samples at different
analyte levels: high positive, moderate positive, low positive, high negative, and two negative
samples.
The study was conducted across three sites, each with two operators over five non-
consecutive days. On each of the five days, each operator performed one run, and each run
included three replicates per sample. This generated a total of 90 replicates per sample (3
sites x 2 operators x 3 replicates x 5 days). There was 100% agreement with expected results
on all bands on all runs, all days and with all operators at all three sites.

standard two-tier test methodology (STTT).
A total of 768 serum samples were procured from two vendors and tested at three US sites.
