Nucleic acids from the bacterial and viral organisms identified by this test are generally detectable in
NPS specimens during the acute phase of infection. Detecting and identifying specific bacterial and
viral nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory infection aids in the
diagnosis of respiratory infection, if used in conjunction with other clinical, epidemiological, and
laboratory findings. The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis,
treatment, or patient management decisions.
Negative results in the presence of a respiratory illness may be due to infection with pathogens that
are not detected by this test or due to lower respiratory tract infection that is not detected by an NPS
specimen. Conversely, positive results do not rule out infection or co-infection with organisms not
detected by the LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex (RSP Flex) Assay. The agent(s) detected may not
be the definite cause of disease.
The use of additional laboratory testing (e.g., bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence, and
radiography), may be necessary when evaluating a patient with possible respiratory tract infection.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay is performed on the LIAISON PLEX System. The
LIAISON PLEX System consists of a touchscreen user interface that includes the software for
running and analyzing assay results, one to six processing/imaging LIAISON PLEX modules, and a
handheld barcode reader. Each LIAISON PLEX module processes one sample at a time under the
control of the LIAISON PLEX System software. The LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay
components required to perform the test include the following single-use, disposables:
• LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay Test Cartridge
• LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay Transfer Pipettes (or equivalent)
Prior to initiating a test on the LIAISON PLEX System, a 300 μL aliquot of NPS in Viral Transport
Media (VTM) is pipetted by the user into the Sample Port within the Sample Prep Tray
(recommended, but not required), followed by closing the Sample Port Closure. Next, the Sample ID
barcode on the sample tube is scanned with the hand-held barcode reader, or the Sample ID is
manually entered using the touchscreen keyboard. The user then scans the assay cartridge ID barcode
with the hand-held barcode scanner. Lastly, the Respiratory Flex Assay Cartridge is inserted into the
module by the user. The LIAISON PLEX System identifies the assay being run and automatically
initiates the proper testing protocol to process the sample, analyze the data, and generate test results.
Once the test is finished running (~ 2 hours), the user ejects the assay cartridge by selecting the green
check mark or the eject icon on the touchscreen.
The Respiratory Flex Assay has 19 different reportable targets (organisms and influenza A subtypes
H1 and H3). Reporting of these targets is based on detection of one or more of the nucleic acid
targets. For each intended Respiratory Flex Assay target, four sequence components, referred to as
oligonucleotides (Oligos), consisting of one or more Capture probe(s), Mediator probe(s), forward
primer(s), and reverse primer(s), are required.
The LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay can be run in Fixed mode, which will return the results
for all target analytes. To allow testing flexibility, the LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay can
be run in Flex mode. This feature allows laboratories to generate custom panels, which include only a
subset of analytes selected by the laboratory. No pre-set Flex-panels are defined, and laboratories can
choose to create custom panels of specific targets for certain populations and/or seasons, if they
desire to incorporate the Flex reporting feature. Target assays that are initially masked can later be
unmasked using Flex credits when ordered by a physician. When Flex mode is implemented, all
target assays are performed, however the raw data is not analyzed for masked targets until they are
unmasked.
Interpretation of Results
The Respiratory Flex Assay provides a qualitative result for the presence (Detected) or absence (Not
Detected) of the Respiratory Flex target nucleic acid gene sequences. The image analysis of the
Substrate provides light signal intensities from the target-specific capture spots as well as the internal
processing controls, negative control, background, and imaging control spots. The mean signal
intensity of a target, after background subtraction, is compared to the assay’s signal detection
threshold to make a determination. Table 2 below lists the possible test results generated by the
Respiratory Flex Assay representing identification of viral and bacterial nucleic acid
sequences/targets.

*Detection of Influenza A without an Influenza A/H1 or Influenza A/H3 subtype may occur at low titer of
the virus in the specimen or may indicate a false positive due to contamination. The result could also
indicate a novel Influenza A strain. In these cases, the sample should be retested. If an Influenza A
detected result is obtained without detection of an Influenza A/H1 or A/H3 subtype upon retesting,
contact local or state public health authorities for confirmatory testing.
**Detection of Influenza A/H1 or Influenza A/H3 subtypes without an Influenza A “Detected” result may
occur at low titer of the virus in the specimen or may indicate a false positive due to contamination. The
result could also indicate potential genetic mutations in the Matrix protein gene among circulating
seasonal Influenza A viruses. In these cases, the sample should be retested. If an Influenza A/H1 or A/H3
subtype detected result is obtained again without detection of Influenza A upon repeat testing, further
investigations may be warranted.

B Principle of Operation:
The Respiratory Flex Assay is a multiplexed molecular assay with automated nucleic acid isolation,
amplification, and detection of unique genomic sequences of target pathogens. The Respiratory Flex
Assay is performed using the LIAISON PLEX System, which is a bench-top sample-to-result
molecular diagnostics workstation consisting of a touchscreen user interface that includes the
software for running and analyzing assay results, one to six processing/imaging LIAISON PLEX
modules, and a handheld barcode reader. The LIAISON PLEX System automates the Respiratory
Flex Assay sample analysis steps, which occur within the cartridge, including: (1) Specimen
Extraction – Chemical and mechanical RNA/DNA extraction from nasopharyngeal swab specimens
obtained from symptomatic patients; (2) Target Amplification - Multiplex RT-PCR- and PCR-based
amplification of the extracted nucleic acids to generate target-specific amplicons; (3) Hybridization -
Amplicon hybridization to target specific capture DNA in a microarray format and mediator and
gold-nanoparticle probe hybridization to captured amplicons. Silver enhancement of the gold
nanoparticle probes bound at the capture sites results in gold-silver aggregates that are imaged
optically with high efficiency by the LIAISON PLEX System. The user can monitor the status of the
assay via the touch screen on the instrument, which displays the run time.
Contamination Control
The Respiratory Flex Assay includes an Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UDG) enzyme-based strategy to
eliminate amplicon contamination. Briefly, the lyophilized amplification master mix formulation
contains deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) in place of the standard deoxythymidine triphosphate
(dTTP), and during the multiplexed RT-PCR step dUTP is incorporated into the amplicons. Prior to
the start of an amplification step, the UDG enzyme renders any dUTP-containing previously
generated amplicons non-amplifiable by selectively hydrolyzing at the uracil base, while not
impacting the integrity of dTTP containing target RNA. The assay also uses a thermolabile version of
UDG enzyme which is inactivated by heat prior to the RT step and does not interfere with the newly
generated cDNA and/or the amplicon from the test. While the UDG-based strategy mitigates false
positive risk due to lab-based carryover and cross-contamination, incomplete hydrolysis of uracil-
containing amplicons may lead to amplification and detection of a contaminant. Additionally, this
strategy does not address genomic contamination during the preparation of the samples. Strict
adherence to the prescribed handling/preparation of samples and laboratory/system cleaning
protocols and careful disposal of the used consumables can reduce the likelihood of contamination
from user-based sources.
End-Point Detection and Analysis
The target-specific amplicon is detected in an endpoint assay that utilizes a microarray format. For
each of the bacterial or viral nucleic acid sequences/analytes detected by the Respiratory Flex Assay,
two types of oligonucleotides are required for the endpoint gold nanoparticle probe-based detection:
(1) Capture oligonucleotides (or captures) and (2) Mediator oligonucleotides (or mediators). The

	The overall signal across all spot groups, excluding

--- Page 7 ---
Capture oligonucleotides are arrayed on the surface of a substrate (a microarray) within the test
cartridge and are designed to specifically bind to one part of the analyte-specific target amplicon. The
Mediator oligonucleotides bind to a different portion of the same amplicon and enable binding of
gold nanoparticle probes. Notably, in a multiplexed detection system, numerous unique target-
specific mediators can coexist and form unique hybridizations at the different captures on the
microarray. Since all the mediators have a target specific region and a poly-A tail region, a single,
universal gold nanoparticle poly-T probe is sufficient for target/mediator labeling. Silver
enhancement of the bound gold nanoparticle probes at the capture sites results in gold-silver
aggregates that scatter light with high efficiency. Light scatter from the capture spots is imaged by
the LIAISON PLEX System and intensities from the microarray spots are processed by a decision
algorithm to make calls regarding the presence (Detected) or absence (Not Detected) of a nucleic
acid sequence/analyte.

5. Quality Control:
Internal Controls
The Assay contains three sets of internal controls to check to ensure performance of sample
preparation amplification, and detection. They are described in more detail, below:
1. Extraction control. The extraction control verifies the presence of an amplicon for
Bacteriophage MS2, which is added to the sample prior to the nucleic acid extraction step.
The extracted control product is amplified and subsequently detected by unique spots on the
hybridization array, thereby confirming successful nucleic acid extraction, Reverse
Transcription, PCR amplification of RNA targets, and detection.
2. Amplification Control. The amplification control verifies the presence of an amplicon for a
synthetic DNA oligonucleotide sequence in the lyophilized PCR master mix. The product is
detected by a unique spot on the hybridization array, thereby confirming successful PCR
amplification and detection of DNA targets.
3. Hybridization Control. The hybridization control target and mediator oligonucleotide are
contained within the Sample Buffer and added to the post-amplification product prior to
hybridization. The hybridization control is detected by a unique spot on the hybridization
array, thereby confirming successful processing of hybridization and signal enhancement
steps.
K233410 - Page 7 of 56

--- Page 8 ---
Internal controls results are reported as Pass, Fail, or N/A (see Table 4 for detailed explanations
of each control result). Internal controls must either (1) generate a signal above threshold in each
internal reaction for the system to report a valid test result, or (2) the amplification or extraction
control result can be below the signal threshold if a DNA or RNA target pathogen is detected,
respectively.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a. Within-Laboratory Precision
Within-laboratory precision was evaluated at a single site using the Respiratory Flex Assay
run on the LIAISON PLEX System. A total of three contrived panels containing known
quantities of the target analytes were prepared in simulated NPS matrix, consisting of HeLa
cells at a concentration of 2x103 cells/mL in UTM. Data supporting the use of simulated
matrix can be found in section VII Performance Charactestics.B.2.Matrix Equivalency
Study, later in this document. The viral and bacterial materials used to generate the positive
panel members are denoted in Table 6. The contrived positive panels consisted of five
representative target organisms co-spiked at a low positive concentration (1.5x LoD) and
moderate concentration (5x LoD). A negative panel was also included in the study (see Table
7). The study was conducted with one operator and three cartridge lots over the course of 5
non-consecutive days on two LIAISON PLEX Systems. Each panel member was tested in
triplicate once per day on 5 different days generating a total of 45 replicates per panel
member (1 Site x 1 Operator x 3 Lots x 5 Days X 1 Run per Day x 3 Replicates per Run).

All low positive (1.5x LoD) panel members were positive >97.8%, except for Bordetella
pertussis, which had a positivity of 93.3% (42/45). All moderate positive (5x LoD) panel
members were 100% positive for the spiked target analytes, except for adenovirus and
hMPV, which yielded 97.8% positivity (44/45). The negative panel member was 100%
negative. There was no lot-to-lot variability observed in the study. The results of the study
demonstrate acceptable assay variability.
b. Reproducibility
A reproducibility study was conducted at three testing sites using the Respiratory Flex Assay
run on the LIAISON PLEX System. The study incorporated potential sources of variation
introduced by site (three testing sites), day (5 different days), operator (two operators per
site), and instrument (six LIAISON PLEX Systems). One lot of Respiratory Flex Assay
cartridges was tested at three sites by two operators per site over five days.
The same three contrived panels used to evaluate precision (see Table 7) were included in
the reproducibility study. Three replicates of each panel member were tested by each operator
at each site on all 5 days of testing generating a total of 90 replicates per panel member. The
qualitative results of the study are illustrated in Table 9.

Not applicable; this is a qualitative assay.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
The inclusivity of the LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay was evaluated using a
combination of in silico analysis of publicly available sequence information and laboratory
testing of contrived specimens containing viral and bacterial isolates that were selected to
represent phylogenetic, geographic, and temporal diversity.
a. Wet-Testing
This study was performed to determine the analytical reactivity of the Respiratory Flex Assay
with clinically relevant strains, serotypes, or subtypes of the target species. The inclusivity
panel was prepared by spiking various target microorganism strains/serotypes/subtypes
encompassing temporal and geographical diversity into simulated NPS matrix at a
concentration of ~3x LoD and testing in triplicate. Data supporting the use of simulated
matrix can be found in section VII Performance Charactestics.B.2.Matrix Equivalency
Study, later in this document. Strains that did not yield 100% reactivity at 3x LoD were
reprepared at the same concentration and retested in triplicate. If 100% reactivity was
obtained during retesting, reactivity was reached. In this situation, the original and retesting
results were pooled for performance calculations. If less than 100% reactivity was observed
during retesting, the strain was prepared at a higher concentration and tested until 100%
reactivity was achieved. The strains evaluated and the lowest concentration that met the
reactivity criteria outlined above are shown in Table 10 - Table 23, below.

The results from this study demonstrate that the Respiratory Flex Assay is capable of
detecting multiple clinically relevant strains of each target analyte.
In silico
The inclusivity of the LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay was evaluated using in silico
analysis of the oligonucleotides (i.e., forward primer(s), reverse primer(s), capture and
mediator probe(s)) for all assay targets in relation to sequences available in GISAID (for
SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza A/H1, influenza A/H3, and influenza B) and sequences
in NCBI GenBank for all other target organisms.
Sequence alignments were generated using a publicly available sequence alignment program.
Sequences with full coverage of all four oligo-binding regions (forward primer, reverse
primer, mediator probe and capture probe) were included in the analyses. Partial target
sequences and sequences with ambiguous or degenerate bases in an oligo binding region
were excluded. A match (i.e., predicted reactivity) was based on the following criteria for all
organisms other than SARS-CoV-2: >90% homology between the oligo and reference
sequences. If <90% homology was observed, a melting temperature (Tm) analysis was
performed using a publicly available Tm calculator and applying assay specific conditions.
The Tm analysis involved comparing the calculated mismatch Tm values against the assay’s
PCR annealing temperature for the primers, against the RT temperature for the RT primers,
and against the target hybridization temperature for the capture and mediator probes. If the
Tm of the mismatch oligo:sequence pair was above the assay’s temperature for the pertinent
RT-PCR step (i.e., annealing, RT, or target hybridization), then reactivity was predicted. The
>90% homology threshold was chosen because the Respiratory Flex Assay’s oligos are
designed to have a much higher Tm than the annealing/RT temperature for primers and the
hybridization temperature for the capture and mediator probes. As such, the longest oligos in
the Respiratory Flex Assay are more tolerant to mismatches.
For SARS-CoV-2, the criteria were stricter due to the propensity of this organism to acquire
point mutations. Specifically, 100% homology was expected between the oligo and reference
sequences for at least one gene oligo set. If <100% homology was observed for all gene oligo
sets, the same melting temperature analysis and reactivity criteria described above were
employed.
For SARS-CoV-2, 5,622,325 sequences in GISAID (as of July 31, 2023) were included in the
analysis. These sequences included all variants of concern or variants of interest defined as of
July 31, 2023. The LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay targets three SARS-CoV-2 gene
regions. The Respiratory Flex Assay result logic states that if at least 1 of these targets is
detected, SARS-CoV-2 is positive. This same result logic was implemented for the in silico
inclusivity assessment. Of the sequences included in this evaluation, 99.94%
(5,619,069/5,622,325) have no mismatch in at least one gene oligo set and thus are predicted
to be detected by the Respiratory Flex Assay. Of the 0.04% (3,256/5,622,325) of sequences
with mismatches in at least one oligo binding region in all 3 SARS-CoV-2 target genes, a Tm
analysis revealed that amplification/hybridization were expected to occur. Thus, it is
expected that 100% of SARS-CoV-2 sequences evaluated in this study will be detected by
the assay.
For influenza A, influenza A H1, influenza A H3, and influenza B, sequences uploaded to
GISAID between September 1, 2015, and July 7, 2023, were included in the analysis. The
following number of sequences were included in the evaluation of influenza A, A H1, A H3,
and influenza B: 112,056, 54,364, 104,428, 26,470. Of the 26,470 influenza B sequences,

66.1% (17,509/26,470) were Victoria lineage, 30.9% (8,167/26,470) were Yamagata lineage,
and 3.0% (794/26,470) were of unknown/unclassified lineage. The influenza in silico
inclusivity analysis results are shown in Table 24. Based on the reactivity criteria (>90%
homology), 99.9% (112,034/112,056) of influenza A (matrix gene) sequences are expected to
be detected, 98.9% (53,778/54,364) of influenza A H1 sequences are expected to be detected,
99.9% (104,315/104,428) of influenza A H3 sequences are expected to be detected, and
99.9% (26,433/26,470) of influenza B sequences are expected to be detected.

For all other target organisms, in silico inclusivity analyses was performed using sequences
available from the GenBank nt database as of July 7, 2023. The majority of sequences
evaluated for each target organism are expected to be detected by the Respiratory Flex Assay.
Cross-Reactivity
a. Cross-Reactivity Wet-Testing
i. Off-Panel Cross-Reactivity
This study evaluated the analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) of the Respiratory Flex
Assay in the presence of non-targeted microorganisms that may be found in a respiratory
tract clinical specimen. Sixty (60) non-target microorganisms (Table 25) were evaluated
in the study. Panel members were composed of one individual non-target microorganism
spiked into simulated NPS matrix at >105 TCID /mL (or equivalent) for viruses, >106
50
CFU/mL (or equivalent) for bacteria/fungi, or the highest concentration available. Data
supporting the use of simulated matrix can be found in section VII Performance
Charactestics.B.2.Matrix Equivalency Study, later in this document. For
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, genomic DNA was evaluated to minimize pathogenic
exposure to the test operator. Additionally, DNA was evaluated for Bordetella
parapertussis Bpp5, which was identified by in silico analysis to contain a sequence that
was between 80.0% - 95.8% identical with the primers, mediators, or capture oligos of
the Respiratory Flex Bordetella pertussis assay. Wet testing was performed with
synthetic DNA consisting of the sequence for the matching region of the B. parapertussis
genome to determine if cross-reactivity with the Bordetella pertussis assay occurred.
To evaluate cross-reactivity, each panel was evaluated in triplicate in the absence of the
target organisms. No cross-reactivity was observed at the concentrations tested except for
Mycoplasma genitalium at a concentration of 4x106 CCU/mL, which cross-reacted with
the Mycoplasma pneumoniae assay in 50% of replicates (3/6). The concentration of

1A portion of the B. parapertussis Bpp5 genome was identified by in-silico analysis as potentially
cross-reactive with B. pertussis. Synthetic DNA was tested that matched the region of high homology
in the assay. Testing was included in the off-panel cross-reactivity study since the targeted sequence
was not expected to be detected as B. parapertussis by the assay.

3At 4x106 CCU/mL, Mycoplasma genitalium was cross-reactive with the Mycoplasma pneumoniae
assay in 50.0% (3/6) of replicates. The Mycoplasma genitalium concentration was lowered to 1x106
CCU/mL and 4x105 CCU/mL and had 0% (0/3) positivity for both concentrations.
ii. On-Panel Cross-Reactivity
Potential intra-panel cross-reactivity was evaluated with twenty-eight (28) on-panel
microorganisms (Table 26). The on-panel organisms were evaluated by spiking each
independently into simulated NPS matrix at >105 TCID /mL (or equivalent) for viruses
50
and >106 CFU/mL (or equivalent) for bacteria, or the highest concentration available.
Data supporting the use of simulated matrix can be found in section VII Performance
Charactestics.B.2.Matrix Equivalency Study, later in this document. To evaluate
potential intra-panel cross-reactivity, each panel was evaluated in triplicate. The results of
testing are shown in Table 26.

1These influenza A non-subtype H1/H3 strains are expected to be inclusive to the influenza A
matrix target, only (i.e., are expected to be reported as influenza A positive, subtype
H1/subtype H3 negative). All were negative for both subtype H1 and subtype H3, as
anticipated.
2This influenza A H1N2 strain is expected to be inclusive to the influenza A matrix target and
influenza A subtype H1 target. This strain was positive for both the influenza A matrix target
and influenza A subtype H1 target, as expected.
b. In silico
In silico analysis of assay specificity/exclusivity was performed by conducting a BLAST
comparison of the assay’s oligos sequences to the GenBank nt sequence database, as of July
14, 2023. Sequences for 83 off-panel organisms (68 bacteria/fungi and 15 viruses) that can be
found in a respiratory specimen were included. Additionally, sequences for all on-panel
organisms were included to evaluate intra-panel cross-reactivity. A summary of the results
from the analysis is provided in Table 27. The LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex assays
were shown to be specific for their respective analytes with the following exceptions, which
are noted in the device labeling:
• Cross-reaction of the Adenovirus assays with closely related Adenovirus G (serotype
52) strains.
• Cross-reaction of the SARS-CoV-2 assays with closely related bat and pangolin
coronavirus sequences;
• Cross-reaction of the B. parapertussis assay with strains of B. bronchiseptica that
carry IS1001;
• Cross-reaction of the influenza A H1 subtyping assay with 3 swine H3N2 strains and
1 avian H6N1 strain;

cross-reaction.
Microbial Interference
To determine if non-target organisms can interfere with detection of on-panel organisms in the
same sample, a microbial interference study was conducted. The study evaluated 16 non-target
organisms spiked into simulated NPS matrix at >105 TCID /mL for viruses and >106 CFU/mL
50
for bacteria/fungi, or the highest concentration available. Data supporting the use of simulated
matrix can be found in section VII Performance Charactestics.B.2.Matrix Equivalency
Study, later in this document. In addition to each non-target organism, each sample was co-
spiked with five representative on-panel targets (i.e., B. pertussis, adenovirus, influenza B,
hMPV, and SARS-CoV-2) at 3x LoD. To evaluate microbial interference, testing was performed
in triplicate. If on-panel organisms were detected at <100%, samples were reprepared at the same
concentration and retested in triplicate. If 100% detection of the on-panel targets was obtained
during retesting, no additional testing was performed. When this situation was encountered, the
original and retesting results were pooled for performance calculations. Results of the study are
shown in Table 28. No microbial interference was observed except for Streptococcus pyogenes
at 1x106 CFU/mL and Legionella pneumophilia at 4x105 CFU/mL, which interfered with
detection of adenovirus in 16.7% (1/6) of replicates.

Interfering Substances
An analytical study was performed to assess the potential inhibitory effects of exogenous and
endogenous substances that may be commonly found in NPS specimens. A representative panel
of five Respiratory Flex target organisms - Bordetella pertussis, adenovirus, influenza B, hMPV,
and SARS-CoV-2 were co-spiked at 3x LoD in simulated NPS matrix and challenged with the 34
substances illustrated in Table 29. Testing was performed in triplicate. Data supporting the use of
simulated matrix can be found in section VII Performance Charactestics.B.2.Matrix

subsequently tested with the Respiratory Flex Assay.
2A nylon nasopharyngeal swab was fully coated with human sputum/mucus and then eluted into 2 mL
of simulated NPS matrix, containing 5 representative target organisms at 3x LoD. The eluent was
subsequently tested with the Respiratory Flex Assay.
If an on-panel organism in the panel was detected at <100%, samples were reprepared at the
same concentration (for both the on-panel organisms and the potential interfering substance) and
retested in triplicate. If 100% detection of the on-panel targets was obtained during retesting, no
additional testing was performed. When this situation was encountered, the original and retesting
results were pooled for performance calculations. If less than 100% detection was observed
during retesting, the sample was reprepared at a lower concentration of the interfering substance
and tested until 100% detection was achieved.
No interference was observed except for the substances illustrated in Table 30 and described in
more detail below:
• Human sputum/mucus (prepared by coating a nylon NPS swab with human sputum/mucus,
eluting the swab in 1 mL of simulated NPS matrix containing 5 representative target
organisms at 3x LoD, and then testing the eluate) interfered with detection of hMPV,
influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2. For hMPV and influenza B, interference was observed
during both initial testing and retesting, so per the study protocol, testing was performed at a
less challenging concentration until interference was no longer observed (i.e., eluting the

swab into 2 mL of simulated NPS matrix containing 5 representative target organisms at 3x
LoD). Interference was no longer observed when human sputum/mucus was eluted into 2 mL
of simulated NPS matrix containing 5 representative analytes.
• Human whole blood at 5.0% v/v interfered with detection of Bordetella pertussis, hMPV, and
influenza B. For hMPV, interference was observed during both initial testing and retesting, so
per the study protocol, testing was performed at a less challenging concentration until
interference was no longer observed. Interference caused by human whole blood no longer
occurred at a concentration of 4.0% v/v.
• Leukocytes at 1000 cells/μL interfered with detection of hMPV and SARS-CoV-2. The
original three replicates tested resulted in 33.3% (1/3) replicates being invalid and 50% (1/2)
positivity for hMPV and 100% positivity (2/2) for SARS-CoV-2. New test material was
prepared and tested, resulting in 66.6% (2/3) invalid results and 0% (0/1) positivity for hMPV
and SARS-CoV-2. Per the study protocol, testing was performed at more dilute
concentrations until 100% detection occurred. Interference caused by leukocytes was no
longer observed at a concentration of 333.3 cells/μL.
• Mupirocin at 3.0 μmol/L interfered with detection of influenza B in 33% (1/3) of replicates
during initial testing. Upon repeat testing, no interference was observed.
• Tobramycin at 76.0 μmol/L interfered with detection of hMPV and SARS-CoV-2 in 50%
(1/2) of replicates during initial testing. In addition, one replicate was invalid during original
testing. Upon repeat testing, no interference was observed.

Competitive Interference (Co-Infection)
The impact of competitive interference, caused by co-infections with on-target analytes, was
evaluated for the Respiratory Flex Assay by testing contrived samples consisting of an on-target
analyte at a low concentration (3x LoD) in the presence of a different target organism at a high
concentration (>1x105 TCID /mL, PFU/mL, or CEID /mL) in simulated NPS matrix. Data

supporting the use of simulated matrix can be found in section VII Performance
Charactestics.B.2.Matrix Equivalency Study, later in this document. For high concentration
Coronavirus HKU1 testing, the highest concentration available (1.31x104 copies/mL) was used.
Testing for each target organism (at low concentration) and each potential competitive strain (at
high concentration) was performed in triplicate for the 54 co-infection combinations illustrated in
Table 31. If competitive interference was observed during initial testing, samples were
reprepared at the same concentration and retested in triplicate. If competitive interference was not
observed during retesting, no additional testing was performed. When this situation was
encountered, the original and retesting results were pooled for performance calculations. If
competitive interference was observed during retesting, the high concentration analyte
concentration was reduced, and additional testing was performed. Results of the study are shown
in Table 31.

3Unexpected negative results were obtained during original and repeat testing for parainfluenza 3,
therefore testing was performed at more dilute coronavirus OC43 concentrations until 100% detection
of parainfluenza 3 occurred.
4The original three replicates tested resulted in 66.7% (2/3) positivity for parainfluenza 3. New test
material was prepared and tested, resulting in 100% (4/4) positivity for parainfluenza 3. Four
replicates were performed during resting, rather than three because a single false positive SARS-
CoV-2 result was obtained during retesting.

testing was performed at more dilute adenovirus concentrations until 100% detection of RSV A
occurred.
6Unexpected negative results were obtained during original and repeat testing for influenza A
(matrix), therefore testing was performed at more dilute adenovirus concentrations until 100%
detection of influenza A (matrix) occurred.

b. Sample Stability
An analytical study was performed to establish the recommended transport and storage
conditions for nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens eluted in UVT /UTM that will be
tested using the Respiratory Flex Assay. A representative panel of five Respiratory Flex
target organisms (i.e., Bordetella pertussis, adenovirus, influenza B, hMPV, and SARS-CoV-
2) was evaluated. Positive samples were prepared by co-spiking the five organisms at
concentrations of 2x and 5x LoD in natural clinical NPS matrix. Negative samples, consisting
of natural clinical NPS matrix, were also included in the study. Initial testing was performed
to establish the baseline time point (t=0 hours) for the study, and additional aliquots of the
samples were stored at each of the following temperature conditions: (1) room temperature
(15-30°C), (2) refrigerated (2-8°C), and (3) Frozen (≤-70°C).
At the designated time points shown in Table 32 below, one positive sample at each
concentration and a negative sample was tested with the Respiratory Flex Assay. The number
of replicates performed for each storage condition and sample concentration is illustrated in
Table 33.

The results of this specimen stability study support the stability claims for the Respiratory
Flex Assay of clinical NPS specimens in UTM/UVT at the following conditions:
• Up to 8-hours at 15-30°C
• Up to 72-hours at 2-8°C
• Up to 30 days at <-70°C
Freeze/Thaw Stability
The performance of the Respiratory Flex Assay with fresh and frozen specimens was
evaluated by testing 4 sample panels, each consisting of 5-6 target analytes co-spiked into
natural clinical NPS matrix (see Table 34). For each of the 19 Respiratory Flex Assay
reportable targets, at least one organism was included in the study. Each positive panel was
prepared at both 2x and 5x LoD. In addition, a negative sample was included the study.

Positive panels spiked at 2x were tested in replicates of 40 at T0 (fresh) and 20 replicates
following 1, 2, and 3 freeze/thaw (F/T) cycles after storage at -70°C. Positive panels spiked at
5x LoD and the negative sample were tested in replicates of 10 at T0 (fresh) and following 1,
2, and 3 F/T cycles after storage at -70°C.
The results of the study support that NPS specimens in UVT/UTM may undergo up to 2 F/T
cycles following storage at -70°C.

c. In-Use Stability
A ‘loaded sample’ study was evaluated to define the duration that the Respiratory Flex Assay
cartridges can remain loaded with sample prior to being run on a LIAISON PLEX
instrument. The loaded sample stability study evaluated 40 cartridges from a single reagent
lot using a multi-analyte co-spiked positive target pool, that contained five targets
(adenovirus, B. pertussis, human metapneumovirus, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2) each at a
final concentration of 5x LoD (for that target) in simulated NPS matrix. Data supporting the
use of simulated matrix can be found in section VII Performance Charactestics.B.2.Matrix
Equivalency Study, later in this document. Twenty valid cartridges were tested immediately
following sample addition to the cartridge. Twenty valid cartridges were tested after adding
the sample into the cartridge and being allowed to sit at room temperature (between 15°C -
30°C) for a minimum of three hours. The Respiratory Flex Assay run time is approximately
two hours so performance of a loaded cartridge after three hours will allow a user to delay
testing a prepared and loaded cartridge for approximately the duration of a single Respiratory
Flex Assay run. All cartridges loaded with sample and tested immediately and loaded with
sample and tested after three hours at room temperature resulted in 100% positivity for all
targets. Results demonstrated that RSP Flex Assay cartridges loaded with sample are stable
for up to three hours.
6. Detection Limit:
A limit of detection study (LoD) was performed to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of the
Respiratory Flex Assay. For this study, thirty-eight (38) strains and isolates (Table 35) that
represent the 19 reportable targets of the Respiratory Flex Assay were tested individually by
serially diluting each target in NPS matrix. Testing was broken into two parts: preliminary and
confirmatory LoD testing. For the preliminary LoD study, a 3-fold dilution series consisting of at
least 3 concentrations was tested in replicates of six per dilution. The preliminary LoD for each
target was defined as the lowest concentration at which 100% of replicates were positive for the
intended reportable target. The confirmed LoD was determined by testing a 3-fold dilution series
of concentrations around the preliminary LoD in replicates of 20. The confirmed LoD for each
organism was defined as the lowest concentration at which ≥ 95% of the replicates were positive
for the intended reportable target. To confirm the LoD, at least one dilution below the LoD was
required to result in less than 95% positivity. The confirmed LoDs for the Respiratory Flex Assay
bacterial and viral analytes are illustrated in Table 36 and Table 37, respectively.

LoD Testing with the WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 (NIBSC, 20/146)
An LoD study was performed to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of the Respiratory Flex Assay
with the World Health Organization (WHO) Internal Standard for SARS-CoV-2. The WHO
SARS-CoV-2 standard was reconstituted then serially diluted in NP matrix. As with the LoD
study described above, testing was broken into two parts: preliminary and confirmatory LoD
testing. For the preliminary LoD study, a 10-fold dilution series consisting of nine concentrations
was tested in triplicate per dilution. The preliminary LoD was defined as the lowest concentration
at which 100% of replicates were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The confirmed LoD was determined
by testing a 3-fold dilution series of multiple concentrations around the preliminary LoD in
replicates of 20. The confirmed LoD was defined as the lowest concentration at which ≥ 95% of

the replicates were positive for the intended reportable target. To confirm the LoD, at least one
dilution below the LoD was required to result in less than 95% positivity. The confirmed LoD for
the Respiratory Flex Assay with the WHO International Standard was 7.7x105 IU/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The Respiratory Flex Assay determines the presence/absence of each target analyte (and control)
by comparing the mean intensity of capture spots to pre-defined thresholds. In addition to the
capture spot thresholds, a set of assay-dependent parameters are used to evaluate the validity of
the run. To determine the threshold and parameter values, a sequential, multi-step approach was
employed.
In the first step, a threshold training set consisting of 1905 samples from analytical testing was
used to estimate the thresholds and assay-dependent parameters. Proposed threshold and assay-
dependent parameter values were determined by their ability to distinguish between true and false
target calls while minimizing the no call rate. The proposed thresholds were determined by the
negative signal distribution, where the target is absent from the samples.
In the second step of threshold determination, the performance of the proposed parameter and
threshold values from step 1 were evaluated using the threshold test set, which consisted of 736
contrived/clinical samples. The clinical samples included in the Assay Cut-Off Study are
independent from those used to demonstrate clinical performance of the Respiratory Flex Assay.
The true call vs. no call rate for performance parameters and controls, and reportable target
sensitivity and specificity were tabulated for presentation to a technical review team.
In the third step, a technical review team consisting of subject matter experts of the assay and
chemistry determined the final threshold values through an assessment of the results for each
performance parameter, control, and reportable target. As part of this analysis, an ROC curve was
generated for each spot group with the final established thresholds marked to illustrate the
expected clinical performance of the Respiratory Flex Assay. The specific assay parameters and
thresholds are not reported in this document, as they are considered confidential and proprietary.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable.
9. Carryover:
An analytical study was performed to assess potential carryover or cross-contamination in the
Respiratory Flex Assay by testing high positive and negative samples in an alternating fashion on
the LIAISON PLEX instrument. The high positive samples consisted of a representative panel of
five assay targets (i.e., B. pertussis, adenovirus, influenza B, hMPV, and SARS-CoV-2).
Contrived positive samples were prepared by spiking B. pertussis at 1x106 CFU/mL and the viral
targets at 1x105 TCID /mL into simulated NPS matrix. Data supporting the use of simulated
50
matrix can be found in section VII Performance Charactestics.B.2.Matrix Equivalency
Study, later in this document.
The study was performed by two operators, each using one of two LIAISON PLEX instruments,
each containing six modules. Alternating high positive and negative samples were evaluated per
the format summarized in Table 38. In total, 30 high positive and 30 negative samples were
evaluated. All high positive samples yielded positive results for the five analytes in the sample,
while all negative samples were negative. These results confirm that there is no evidence of
carryover from samples tested with the Respiratory Flex Assay.

Matrix Equivalency Study
This study was designed to demonstrate the equivalence of simulated NPS matrix used in
analytical studies, with clinically-derived natural NPS matrix. Simulated NPS matrix was
formulated to resemble the content of a clinical NPS specimen collected in VTM, such that the
simulated matrix would not artificially alter the performance of the test. The simulated NPS
matrix consisted of 2x103 HeLa cells/mL in UTM. The natural clinical NPS matrix consisted of
NPS samples collected in UTM, which were negative for all Respiratory Flex Assay targets.
For this study, a representative panel of five assay targets (i.e., B. pertussis, adenovirus, influenza
B, hMPV, and SARS-CoV-2) were co-spiked into pooled negative natural clinical NPS matrix
and simulated NPS matrix at <1x LoD, 2x LoD, and 5x LoD. Aliquots of negative matrices were
also included in the evaluation. Positive samples spiked at <1x LoD and 5x LoD were tested in
replicates of 20 per condition, while positive samples prepared at 2x LoD were tested in
replicates of 60 per condition. Negative samples in natural clinical NPS matrix were tested in
replicates of 22 per condition, while negative samples in simulated NPS matrix were tested in
replicates of 20 per condition. The results of the study are shown in Table 39.

All samples spiked at 5x LoD and 2x LoD met the acceptance criteria of 100% agreement and
95% agreement with expected results, respectively, except for adenovirus at 5x LoD, which was
detected in 95% (19/20) of replicates in both simulated and natural clinical matrices. Since the
results were adenovirus at 5x LoD were equivalent between matrices, they were deemed
acceptable. As expected, detection varied for samples prepared at <1x LoD. All negative samples
were negative, as expected. The results from the study indicate that performance of the
Respiratory Flex Assay is equivalent with a representative panel of analytes seeded into natural
clinical NPS matrix in UTM and simulated NPS matrix in UTM and thus support use of
simulated NPS matrix in select analytical validation studies.
C Clinical Studies:
Prospective Clinical Study
The clinical performance of the LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay was established in a
multi-center study conducted with nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens in BD UVT and
Copan UTM collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.
Specimens were prospectively collected (i.e., all comers between two time points that met the
clinical study inclusion criteria) during the 2022-2023 respiratory illness season (i.e., October
2022 thru April 2023). Specimens were stored refrigerated at 2-8℃ for up to 72-hours before
testing (i.e., Category I specimens) or if they could not be tested within 72-hours, after freezing at
-70℃ (Category II specimens). In total, six geographically distinct sites in the U.S. were
involved in the prospective collection of NPS specimens. Of these six sites, three sites conducted
LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay testing. A fourth site (Luminex), which was not
involved in the prospective collection, also performed Respiratory Flex Assay testing.
A total of 1911 NPS specimens were enrolled in the study. Of these 1911 specimens, 68 were
excluded due to protocol deviations (e.g., specimen not stored appropriately, insufficient volume,
etc.). This left 1843 clinical specimens for evaluation. Of these 1843 specimens, 66.3%
(1221/1843) were tested fresh (Category I specimens), while 33.7% (622/1843) were tested
frozen (Category II specimens). Patient demographic information for the 1843 prospectively
collected NPS specimens is presented in Table 40.

The LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay was evaluated for performance by comparing to an
FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel for all analytes, except the following: SARS-CoV-2, B.
holmesii, B. parapertussis, and B. pertussis. Performance for SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated by
comparing to an FDA-cleared molecular SARS-CoV-2 assay. Performance for the denoted
Bordetella species was based on comparison to well-validated Fragment Analysis (FA) assays
followed by PCR/Bi-Directional Sequencing (PCR/BDS) assays (see Table 41). The FDA-
cleared comparator assays were performed in accordance with their respective package inserts.

Out of the 1843 prospective clinical specimens included in the prospective study analysis, 95.2%
(1755/1843) generated valid Respiratory Flex Assay results (i.e., detected or not detected) on the
first attempt, for an initial invalid rate of 4.8% (88/1843). Of the 88 specimens with initial invalid
results, 77 produced valid results on repeat testing, 6 specimens remained invalid on repeat, and 5
specimens were not retested, resulting in a final invalid rate of 0.6% (11/1843). This left 1832
specimens with valid Respiratory Flex Assay results. The final number of evaluable results
varied by target based on the number of valid comparator method results obtained. The final
number of evaluable results for each assay target is shown in Table 42.

1Eleven specimens were invalid after repeat testing with the Respiratory Flex Assay. Of these 11
specimens, 6 specimens remained invalid on repeat, while 5 specimens were not retested with the
Respiratory Flex Assay.
2Unavailable indicates a specimen that was invalid by the comparator method or not tested with the
comparator method.
A summary of the LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay prospective clinical study
performance is provided in Table 43. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was calculated as 100%
× (TP / (TP + FN)). True positive (TP) indicates that both the Respiratory Flex Assay and the
comparator method had a positive result for the specific analyte, and false negative (FN)
indicates that the Respiratory Flex Assay was negative while the comparator result was positive.
Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was calculated as 100% × (TN / (TN + FP)). True negative
(TN) indicates that both the Respiratory Flex Assay and the comparator method had negative
results, and false positive (FP) indicates that the Respiratory Flex Assay was positive while the
comparator result was negative. Specimens that obtained discordant results underwent additional
testing with an FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel or PCR/BDS for investigation.

20Of the 8 specimens with false positive SARS-CoV-2 results by the Respiratory Flex Assay, 5 were
positive by PCR/BDS, 2 were negative, and 1 was not tested.
Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) ranged from 80.0%-100%, depending on the analyte. The
only analytes for which PPA was lower than expected were B. parapertussis with a PPA of
80.0% (4/5) and parainfluenza 4 with a PPA of 88.9% (8/9). The limited number of positive NPS
specimens for these pathogens required supplementation with archived (Category III specimens)
to obtain accurate PPA point estimates.
Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) ranged from 95.7-100%.
The Respiratory Flex Assay reported multiple organism detections (coinfections) in a total of 176
prospectively collected NPS specimens. Of these 176 specimens, 3 specimens lacked comparator
results for least one organism identified in the coinfection, and thus were excluded from further
analysis. The remaining 173 specimens with coinfections represent 14.6% (173/1187) of all
positive prospective specimens and 9.4% (173/1840) of all prospective specimens. Most
coinfections contained two organisms (87.3%, 151/173) while 11.6% (20/173) contained three
organisms and 1.2% (2/173) contained four organisms. Out of the 173 specimens with
coinfections, 44.5% (77/173) contained one or more organisms that were not detected by the
comparator methods (Table 44). Coinfections identified by the comparator methods which were
not reported by the LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay are illustrated in Table 45.

Retrospective Clinical Study
Several analytes included on the Respiratory Flex Assay were not encountered during the
Prospective Clinical Study in sufficient numbers to demonstrate assay performance. Therefore,
the Prospective Clinical Study was supported by additional testing that was performed at three
U.S. study sites (including one internal) on frozen, archived specimens (Category III specimens)
obtained from four clinical laboratories in the U.S. These specimens were selected for inclusion
in the study based solely on the historic qualitative result.
A total of 256 archived NPS specimens were evaluated, of which 66 negatives were included for
blinding and randomization purposes. A summary of the demographic information of the tested
retrospective specimens is provided in Table 46 below.

The performance of the LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay was determined by comparing
to an FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel for all analytes, except the following: B. holmesii,
B. parapertussis, and B. pertussis. As noted previously in this Decision Summary, performance
for the denoted Bordetella species was based on comparison to analytically validated Fragment
Analysis (FA) assays followed by PCR/Bi-Directional Sequencing (PCR/BDS) assays.
Out of the 256 specimens included in the pre-selected study analysis, 241 (94.1%) generated
valid Respiratory Flex Assay results (i.e., Detected or Not Detected) on the first attempt. There
were 15 specimens (5.9%) with invalid results on the initial run that required retesting. Of the
specimens with initial invalid results; all 15 specimens generated valid Respiratory Flex Assay
results after retest for a final success rate of 100% (256/256).
For the 256 pre-selected specimens, the final number of evaluable results varied by target based
on valid comparator results obtained. The final number of evaluable results for each target is
shown in Table 47.

Contrived Clinical Study
Some respiratory pathogens are so rare that both prospective and archived specimen collection
efforts were insufficient to demonstrate clinical performance. To supplement the prospective
clinical study and retrospective archived study data, an evaluation of contrived specimens was
performed for five pathogens: Bordetella holmesii, Bordetella parapertussis, Bordetella
pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Positive contrived specimens
for influenza A H1N1 pdm09 were prepared and tested prior to completion of the prospective
clinical study, in anticipation of potentially low prevalence for influenza A H1. The prospective
clinical study ended up yielding an adequate number of influenza A H1 positive specimens to
demonstrate performance, however since the contrived data was already acquired, it’s presented
here. These contrived clinical specimens were prepared using unique negative clinical NPS
specimens. Contrived specimens were prepared by spiking representative strains at
concentrations of 2x, 10x, and 100x LoD. Fifty total positive samples for each pathogen were
prepared, interspersed with negative samples, and randomized before testing at two clinical sites.
A total of 300 contrived positive samples were tested along with pre-selected archived specimens
in a randomized, blinded fashion. Out of the 300 specimens included in the contrived study
analysis, 291 specimens (97.0%) generated valid Respiratory Flex Assay results on the first
attempt. There were 9 specimens (3.0%) with an invalid result on the initial run. Of the 9
specimens retested, all 9 generated a valid result after a single retest for a final success rate of
100% (300/300). The results of contrived specimen testing with the Respiratory Flex Assay are
presented in Table 49 below.
