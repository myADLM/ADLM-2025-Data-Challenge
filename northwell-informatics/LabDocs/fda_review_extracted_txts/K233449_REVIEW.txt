See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Avantik VTM is intended for the collection and transport of upper respiratory clinical
specimens containing respiratory viruses, from the collection site to the testing laboratory. The
collection system is a culture-based media that is intended to be used with standard laboratory
examination, culture or with other assays that utilize stable recoverable infectious viral particles.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The Avantik VTM is indicated for the collection and transport of respiratory viruses. The
performance of the Avantik VTM has not been established with non-respiratory or other viruses
or microorganisms.
The Avantik VTM is only intended for use with upper respiratory clinical specimens and has not
been evaluated with other human specimens.
The Avantik VTM has not be validated to stabilize frozen specimens.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Avantik VTM is a Non-Propagating Transport Medium Device for the secure collection and
transportation of biological samples for diagnosing viral infections. The device includes a conical
polypropylene vial filled with 3 mL of culture medium, secured with a high-density polyethylene
screw-on cap. The device is provided in boxes of 50 tubes.
The device can be stored at 2 to 25°C for up to 12 months. Upon collection of a swab sample and
transfer into the Avantik VTM, the specimen can be transported at 2 to 25°C and should be
processed within 48 hours. It is recommended to refrigerate the samples between 2 and 8°C or
store them on wet ice to maintain a temperature of 2 to 8°C during transit since performance studies
indicated better virus recovery at lower temperatures. Avantik VTM is only for use by Trained
Healthcare Professionals.
B Principle of Operation:
The Avantik VTM kit consists of liquid medium and a conical polypropylene vial with screw-on
cap to hold the medium securely that are a standard configuration for VTM tubes. The conical
shape allows for the easy recovery of the viral particles after the specimen is collected and the
medium is agitated to release the viral particles. The liquid medium consists of a mixture of
Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS), Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), L-cysteine, Gelatin,
Sucrose, L-glutamic acid, HEPES, Vancomycin, Amphotericin B, Colistin, and Phenol Red.
These ingredients help to maintain the integrity and recovery of infectious viral particles and
inhibit growth of competing bacteria and fungi.

Shelf-Life. The shelf-life of the Han Chang Medic Avantik VTM was established using real-
time stability studies. Stability was assessed in an initial study using randomly selected
samples from three consecutive lots and tested at various timepoints. Selected lots were
evaluated at each timepoint as described in the table below to determine whether lots
remained stable. Additional testing was conducted on three different lots stored at ambient
temperature, and additional timepoints were obtained in triplicate. For these additional
timepoints, contamination checks were additionally performed by plating the VTM onto solid
media and incubating at 37°C for 48 hours. All samples from all lots at all timepoints gave
passing results for all acceptance criteria. The data support a stability claim of 12 months
when stored at 2 to 25°C.
Transport. Shipping stability of the Han Chang Medic Avantik VTM was demonstrated
using a simulated transport study. Select cases from three lots were subjected to simulated
distribution testing per “ASTM D4169 Standard Practice for Performance Testing of
Shipping Containers and Systems” to evaluate whether the product maintains acceptable
stability under known, stressed shipping conditions. Cases were shipped to the US and
subjected to distribution methods before being shipped back to Korea for evaluation.
Samples were evaluated according to the methods described in Table 1. All samples from all
lots at all timepoints met all the specifications based on the predefined acceptance criteria.

6. Detection Limit:
The performance of the Han Chang Medic Avantik VTM was evaluated in culture-based
viral recovery studies to determine virus viability at different storage times and temperatures.
Testing was performed in accordance with the general guidelines of “CLSI M40-A2 Quality
Control of Microbiological Transport Systems; Approved Standard - Second Edition”.
Sample Preparation. Strains of Influenza A (H3N2) virus, Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
VR-26, and Human coronavirus (hCoV) NL63 were used for media validation. Viral stocks
were prepared at 1.4 to 4.2 × 106 TCID /mL such that when virus preparations were
50
inoculated into the VTM, they would ideally achieve ~40 to 50% infection when seeded into
host cell monolayers for the viral quantification assay; the dilution strategy for each viral
strain was previously determined in a pilot study. Samples were prepared in negative clinical
matrix (NCM) composed of commercial nasal fluid diluted 1:1 in physiological saline.
Viral Recovery. Viability was assessed by using three non-consecutive lots selected to
represent fresh, middle, and expired representative samples. Lots were stored at ambient
room temperature (20 to 30°C) with the humidity ranging from 30 to 60% RH prior to use. A
total of 162 samples were used with testing performed in triplicate for each lot, virus, and test
condition (3 replicates × 3 lots × 3 strains × 2 temperatures × 3 timepoints). Samples were
prepared in 1:1 dilutions of virus stock and NCM (1:1 dilutions of nasal fluid:saline). One
hundred (100) µL of each sample was dispensed into an empty 1.5 mL tube, and a swab is
used to collect the sample and transfer it into the individual VTM tubes. Samples were stored
at controlled temperatures of 4 and 22°C for 0 and 48 hours. To demonstrate recovery,
aliquots of each tube mixture were transferred to host cell culture plates, and a viral
quantification assay was performed in which virus infectivity was measured by
immunofluorescence to assess viral preservation compared to baseline. Study results are
shown as normalized percentages of reduction in virus infectivity relative to Time 0 in the
Table 2 below. The Han Chang Medic Avantik VTM demonstrated acceptable recovery of
influenza A, RSV, and hCoV at refrigerated or room temperature up to 48 hours.

Cytotoxicity Assessment. The cytotoxicity profile of the Han Chang Medic Avantik VTM
was also assessed to ensure that the volume of VTM added during the viral quantification
assay does not demonstrate any cytopathic effects on the assay cells. Assay cell cultures were
incubated with VTM, and cytotoxicity was measured using an MTT assay, which is a
colorimetric assay for assessing cell metabolic activity. The results demonstrate that the
medium is non-toxic to mammalian host cells.
