The TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-
CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal specimens from individuals with signs and
symptoms of respiratory tract infection.
The TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of
COVID-19 if used in conjunction with other clinical observations, epidemiological information,
and laboratory findings. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA is generally detectable in upper respiratory
(anterior nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs) specimens during the acute phase of infection.
Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Positive results do not rule
out bacterial infection or co-infection with other pathogens. The agent detected may not be the
definite cause of disease.
Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis
for patient management decisions.
The TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit is intended for use by qualified clinical laboratory
personnel specifically instructed and trained in the techniques of real-time PCR and in vitro
diagnostic procedures.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IVD - For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
This assay is to be used with one of the following real-time PCR instruments only:
• Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument
• Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 5 Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit is a multiplex real-time RT-PCR test for the
qualitative detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal
specimens. Each TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit includes:
K233453 - Page 2 of 25

--- Page 3 ---
• TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Assay Multiplex: Primer and probe sets to detect
RNA from three specific genomic regions in SARS-CoV-2: Open Reading Frame (ORF)
1ab, Spike (S) protein, Nucleocapsid (N) protein and primers/probes for MS2
bacteriophage.
• MS2 bacteriophage, an internal processing control (IPC) for nucleic acid extraction.
• TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Control as a positive RNA control that contains
targets specific to the SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions targeted by the assays.
• TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Control Dilution Buffer for diluting the TaqPath
COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Control to a working concentration.
Patient samples and the IPC are manually added to KingFisher 96 Deep-Well plates and loaded
onto the KingFisher Flex Purification System along with reagents from the MagMAX
Viral/Pathogen II Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit for automated processing. In this process, nucleic
acids from the patient samples are recovered using magnetic-bead technology. Unbound
substances and impurities are removed with automated wash steps and purified nucleic acid is
eluted from the beads with Elution Buffer.
The extracted sample RNA is subsequently mixed with TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR
Assay Multiplex and the TaqPath 1‑Step Multiplex Master Mix (No ROX) in 96-well reaction
plates and loaded onto one of the following instruments for reverse transcription into cDNA
followed by amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 target sequences and the MS2 IPC target
sequence:
• Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real Time PCR instrument
• Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 5 Dx Real-Time PCR instrument
Following amplification, the data from the test run is imported into COVID-19 Interpretive
Software IVD Edition for analysis and interpretation. The COVID-19 Interpretive Software IVD
Edition analyzes the run data, performs quality check analysis, and calculates the interpretive
results for each sample and control based on the cycle threshold (Ct) value obtained for each of
the targets. The imported data and interpretive results for each run are saved as a batch in the
software. Results can be exported as CSV files and reports can be generated in PDF format.
B Principle of Operation:
The TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit contains primer and probe sets to detect RNA from
three specific genomic regions in SARS-CoV-2: Open Reading Frame (ORF) 1ab, Spike (S)
protein, Nucleocapsid (N) protein and primers/probes for MS2 bacteriophage IPC. During PCR
amplification, the probes anneal to the target sequences located between the forward and reverse
primers for the target genes. During the PCR extension phase, the 5’ nuclease activity of the Taq
polymerase degrades the probe, causing the reporter dye to separate from the quencher dye,
generating a fluorescent signal. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved
from their respective probes, increasing the fluorescence intensity, which is measured at each
PCR cycle by the real-time PCR instrument. Validation of the results is performed automatically
by the COVID-19 Interpretive Software IVD Edition based on the performance of positive and
negative controls (see Table 1 below). The patient sample results are automatically generated
using the calling rules, plate validity and the Ct cutoff values for assay targets as shown in Table
2 below.

VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:
Class II Special Controls as per 21 CFR 866.3981.
VII Performance Characteristics:
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit was assessed across three
sites utilizing both the 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) instrument and the
QuantStudio 5 Dx RT-PCR instrument at each site. A panel of three samples was created
using inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus (USA-WA1/2020) spiked into pooled negative
nasopharyngeal (NP) matrix at concentrations to target 5x limit of detection (LoD), 1.5x
LoD, and 0x LoD (i.e., no analyte). Each site conducted two runs per day involving two
operators each performing one run per day for five non-consecutive days for each of the three
lots of assay reagents. Each run tested three replicates of each sample, resulting in a total of
270 observations per panel member for each RT-PCR instrument (3 sites × 2 operators/site ×
3 lots/operator × 5 days/lot × 3 replicates/day = 270 observations). Samples were blinded and
randomized before testing. All samples were extracted using the KingFisher Flex and the
MagMAX Viral/Pathogen II Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit.
Qualitative results obtained from testing TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit across the
three sites are summarized in Table 4. There was 100% agreement with the expected results
observed across all three testing sites on both the 7500 Fast Dx RT-PCR instrument and the
QuantStudio 5 Dx RT-PCR instrument.
The reproducibility of TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit for the panel members was
also assessed based on the standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (%CV) of the
mean cycle threshold (Ct) value for each potential source of variability. This assessment,
presented in Tables 5 and 6 for each of the RT-PCR instruments, is stratified by the assay
target. An analysis will have less than 270 replicates if there are samples tested that do not
have amplification detected for an assay target. The within-laboratory precision of the
TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit by site was also evaluated and is presented in Table
7 and 8 for each of the RT-PCR instruments.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a) Cross-Reactivity and Microbial Interference
This study evaluated the analytical specificity of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit
by testing samples containing organisms that are commonly found in the respiratory tract and
might cause similar clinical symptoms as SARS-CoV-2. A panel of 46 potentially cross-
reactive organisms (viruses, bacteria and fungi) were spiked into pooled negative
nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical matrix at a high, clinically relevant concentration (106 CFU/mL
or higher for bacteria/fungi and 105 PFU/mL or TCID /mL or higher for viruses) in the
50
absence or presence of SARS-CoV-2 target (spiked at ~3x LoD). Organisms that did not
meet the target testing concentration above were tested at the highest possible concentration.
Each microorganism was tested in triplicate. For all organisms tested, no cross-reactivity or
microbial interference was observed at the concentrations tested, as shown below.

[3]Used to represent diverse microbial flora in the human respiratory tract.
In silico cross-reactivity analysis of the primer sequences was conducted in March 2023 for
the SARS-CoV-2 and MS2 assay components of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR
Kit and common respiratory microorganisms to demonstrate specificity of the primers to
their targeted sequences.
A total of 40,811 genome sequences (31,011 virus isolates, 9,996 bacterial isolates, and 14
fungal isolates) were downloaded from GenBank using the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Genome (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/data-
hub/genome) and NCBI Virus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/). As
complete genomes for Candida albicans and Pneumocystis jirovecii where not on NCBI,
their reference sequences (RefSeq) were tested. Rhinovirus Type 1A did not have any
complete genomes or a RefSeq, so all 18 partial genomes downloaded from NCBI were
tested. These sequences were aligned to the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit assay
primer and probe components using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) software
v2.12.0 (see table below). Microorganisms were considered non cross-reactive if at least one
of the SARS-CoV-2 and MS2 assay primers and probes have ≤80% homology or is predicted
to produce a qPCR amplicon of ≥10,000 bases.

b) Interfering Substances Study:
The potential for interference for the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit was evaluated
with substances that may be present in respiratory specimens. A total of 27 potentially
interfering endogenous and exogenous substances were tested at or above clinically relevant
levels in negative pooled nasopharyngeal clinical matrix in absence (contrived negative
sample) and presence (contrived positive sample) of SARS-CoV-2 target (spiked at ~3x
LoD). Each sample was tested in triplicate. The FluMist nasal vaccine was not tested.
Two of the substances tested in the study, nasal corticosteroid Triamcinolone and nasal spray
or drops containing Oxymetazoline (e.g., Afrin - No Drip, Extra Moisturizing) gave false
results at concentrations greater than 5% (v/v). Additional testing at lower test substance
concentrations were performed to determine the concentration where interference is no
longer observed. None of the 27 substances tested were determined to be inhibitory to the
TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit at the concentrations shown in Table 11 below.

4. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
The inclusivity of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit for detection of SARS-CoV-2
was confirmed by testing fifteen variants of SARS-CoV-2. Positive samples were contrived
by spiking each SARS-CoV-2 virus strain into negative pooled nasopharyngeal clinical
matrix at a concentration of 3x LoD (150 GCE/mL), then tested in triplicate in a blinded and
randomized fashion.
All 15 strains of SARS-CoV-2 tested generated 100% positivity rate demonstrating analytical
inclusivity. Results are summarized in the table below.

In silico analysis was performed to determine inclusivity (reactivity) of the TaqPath COVID-
19 Diagnostic PCR Kit primer/probe sequences with all known strains/isolates of SARS-
CoV-2 from GISAID and GenBank databases from March 2020 to April 2024. Mismatch and
melting temperature analyses were performed and genomes with 100% identity and/or
melting temperature (Tm) greater than the annealing temperature were considered reactive.
Analysis indicated that >99% of the sequences are reactive based on 100% homology or Tm
greater than annealing temperature to at least two of the three assay gene targets of the
TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit. Evaluation of assay components that do not match
100% to target sequences indicates that most primer or probe mismatches are unlikely to
affect assay function.
Sequences from major SARS-CoV-2 variants that were evaluated and found to be reactive
with the assay include but are not limited to Alpha, Beta, Delta, Epsilon, Eta, Gamma, Iota,
Kappa, Lambda, Mu, Omicron, Theta, and Zeta. Specific Omicron pango lineages evaluated
and found to be reactive with the assay include but are not limited to BA.2.86, XBB.1.9.1,
XBB.1.9.2, XBB.2.3, XBB.1.16, XBB.1.5, CH.1.1, JN.1, and KP.2.

b) Specimen Stability Studies
The stability of SARS-CoV-2 targets was evaluated using nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs
collected in viral transport media (VTM). Positive contrived samples were prepared by
spiking inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus into pooled NP swab clinical matrix collected in
VTM. Samples were tested fresh (T0) to establish a baseline and then aliquoted and stored at:
6 hours at ambient temperature (15°C to 30°C), 6 days refrigerated (2°C to 8°C), 35 days
frozen (-30°C to -10°C), and 35 days frozen at ≤-70°C. To establish stability, samples from
each condition were withdrawn and tested at intermediate timepoints including the final
stated timepoint and one time point beyond the final stability claim. The results of the
specimen stability study support the claims listed in Table 13.
Table 13: Stability of Swab Specimens in Viral Transport Media
Storage Temperature Stability
Ambient: 15°C to 30°C 4 hours
Refrigerated: 2°C to 8°C 3 days (72 hours)
Frozen: −30°C to −10°C 30 days; stable up to 1 freeze-thaw cycles
Frozen: ≤ −70°C 30 days; stable up to 3 freeze-thaw cycles
c) Fresh vs. Frozen Studies
A fresh vs. frozen study was performed to demonstrate equivalency between fresh and frozen
SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs in viral transport media (VTM). Positive contrived
samples were prepared by spiking inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in negative pooled NP
swab matrix at a concentration of 0x, 1.5x and 5x LoD. Samples were tested at baseline and
subsequently after 1x and 2x freeze-thaw cycles when stored at -10°C to -30°C, and after 1x,
2x, 3x and 4x freeze-thaw cycles when stored at ≤ -70°C. Ten replicates were tested for
samples prepared at 0x and 5x LoD and 40 replicates were tested for samples at 1.5x LoD.
All samples were negative at 0x LoD and all samples spiked at 1.5x and 5x LoD were
positive. The results demonstrated that freeze-thaw up to two cycles when stored at -10°C to
-30°C, and freeze-thaw up to four cycles when stored at ≤ -70°C, does not impact the
performance of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit.
d) Transport Media Comparison
The following six different transport media were evaluated for compatibility with the
TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit:
• Remel MicroTest M4RT Multi-Microbe Media
• Remel MicroTest M5 Multi-Microbe Media
• Remel MicroTest M6 Multi-Microbe Media
• Copan Universal Transport Medium (UTM-RT)
• Bartels FlexTrans Transport Medium
• BD Universal Viral Transport Medium

Storage Temperature	Stability
Ambient: 15°C to 30°C	4 hours
Refrigerated: 2°C to 8°C	3 days (72 hours)
Frozen: −30°C to −10°C	30 days; stable up to 1 freeze-thaw cycles
Frozen: ≤ −70°C	30 days; stable up to 3 freeze-thaw cycles

--- Page 19 ---
Comparable qualitative and quantitative results were obtained with all the six transport media
types in the study.
7. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit was
determined by serially diluting gamma-irradiated SARS‑CoV‑2 virus (USA‑WA1/2020) into
pooled negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab matrix. Samples were randomized and blinded
prior to testing on two PCR instruments: QuantStudio 5 Dx RT-PCR instrument and 7500
Fast Dx RT-PCR instrument. LoD is defined as the lowest concentration of SARS-CoV-2
RNA that can be detected at a rate of at least 95%.
A preliminary LoD was determined by testing five replicates of three-fold dilutions of
quantified SARS-CoV-2 inactivated virus. Subsequently, the LoD was confirmed by testing
20 replicates to demonstrate a ≥95% detection rate at the LoD.
The study established the LoD of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit to be 50
genomic copy equivalent (GCE)/mL when used with both, the QuantStudio 5 Dx RT-PCR
instrument and the 7500 Fast Dx RT-PCR instrument. Table 14 below summarizes the results
for each SARS-CoV-2 target, including mean cycle threshold (Ct), standard deviation (SD),
COVID-19 positivity, and % assay target hit rate.

[1]Assay target hit rate is calculated by the number of assay targets that are called positive divided by the number
of replicates tested. Based on the calling rules of the assay, COVID‑19 positive is called if two or more of the
three assay targets (Orf1ab, N gene, S gene) are called positive. Samples can have different combinations of
positive targets, thus contributing to a less than 100% hit rate on the assay target level but 100% hit rate on the
COVID‑19 positivity call.
[2]For concentration levels that did not produce a positive result, no Ct statistics is displayed and it is denoted as
'N/A'.
LoD Determination with WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 RNA
The LoD of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit was determined using contrived
positive specimens that were created by spiking the reconstituted WHO International Standard
for SARS‑CoV‑2 RNA (NIBSC code: 20/146) in pooled negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab
matrix in viral transport media (VTM). The study was conducted in two phases. In Phase I, a
preliminary LoD was determined by testing serial dilutions of contrived positive samples at nine
concentrations. In Phase II, the LoD was confirmed by testing 20 replicates at three
concentrations based around the preliminary LoD.
The LoD of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit using the WHO International Standard
for SARS‑CoV‑2 RNA (NIBSC code: 20/146) was 150 IU/mL for the 7500 Fast Dx RT-PCR
instrument and 50 IU/mL for the QuantStudio 5 Dx RT-PCR instrument. The LoD results for
each SARS-CoV-2 target, including mean Ct, standard deviation (SD), % COVID-19 positivity,
and % assay target hit rate are summarized in Table 15 below.

8. Assay Cut-Off:
Once a TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit test run is completed, the data from the RT-PCR
instrument's data collection software is imported into COVID-19 Interpretive Software IVD
Edition for analysis and interpretation. The COVID-19 Interpretive Software calculates the
interpretive results for each sample and control based on the cycle threshold (Ct) value obtained
for each of the targets. The following Ct cutoff values for the assay targets is used during result
interpretations.
Table 16: Ct Cutoff Values for Assay Targets in TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit
Sample or Control Target Ct Cutoff
MS2 Valid Ct values are >37
Positive Control
Viral targets Valid Ct values are ≤37
MS2 Valid Ct values are ≤32
Negative Control
Viral targets Valid Ct values are >37
MS2 Valid Ct values are ≤32[1]
Clinical samples
Viral targets Positive Ct values are ≤37
[1]If any of the viral targets is positive, the Ct for MS2 can be >32.
9. Carry-Over:
Carry-over/cross-contamination rate of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit was
evaluated by testing contrived SARS‑CoV‑2 high-positive (formulated at approximately 1×105
plaque forming units (PFU)/mL in pooled negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix) and SARS-
CoV-2 negative samples in a checkerboard pattern. Ten runs using two KingFisher Flex
purification instruments, two operators, and one of each real time PCR instruments–7500 Fast
Dx RT-PCR instrument and QuantStudio 5 Dx RT-PCR instrument, were performed. Each run
tested 47 replicates of contrived SARS-CoV-2 high positive samples and 47 replicates of SARS-
CoV-2 negative samples.
Out of a total of 470 negative samples tested, four false positive SARS‑CoV‑2 results were
obtained. Two false positive results were obtained on 7500 Fast Dx RT-PCR instrument and two
false positive results on QuantStudio 5 Dx RT-PCR instrument. The total carry-over/cross-
contamination rate of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit was determined to be 0.85%
(4/470).

C Clinical Studies:
The clinical performance of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit was established in a
multi-site prospective study with three external testing sites evaluating nasopharyngeal (NP) and
anterior nasal (AN) swab specimens in BD universal viral transport (UVT) medium from
individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection. One NP swab and one AN
swab was collected from each participant enrolled in the all-comer prospective study from 11
geographically diverse locations in the US. The swab collection order was alternated between the
NP and the AN swab. Testing of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit was conducted on
the 7500 Fast Dx RT-PCR instrument and QuantStudio 5 Dx RT-PCR instrument. A composite
comparator approach, using three highly sensitive FDA cleared/authorized SARS‑CoV‑2
molecular assays was used to evaluate the performance of the TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic
PCR Kit. The composite comparator result was defined as the concordant results from two
comparator assays. In case of discordance between the initial two comparator assays, the sample
was tested by a third assay and the result of the third test determined the composite comparator
result.
From April to August 2023, a total of 1,076 subjects were enrolled in the prospective clinical
study. After exclusion of samples due to withdrawal from the study, not meeting the inclusion
criteria or incomplete consent forms, shipment delays at collection sites or specimen leakage
during transit, a total of 1,055 NP swab specimens and 1,052 AN swab specimens were tested in
the study. Of the 1,055 NP swab specimens tested, two NP swab specimens with
inconclusive/invalid results on the 7500 Fast Dx and QuantStudio 5 Dx RT-PCR instruments
were excluded from data analysis, resulting in 1,053 evaluable NP swab specimens on each
instrument. Of the 1,052 AN swab specimens, three had inconclusive result on the 7500 Fast Dx
Real‑Time PCR instrument and were excluded from data analysis, resulting in 1,049 evaluable
AN swab specimens on the 7500 Fast Dx RT-PCR instrument and 1,052 evaluable AN swab
specimens on the QuantStudio 5 Dx RT-PCR instrument. Specimens evaluated using the
TaqPath COVID-19 Diagnostic PCR Kit were tested either fresh (tested within 72 hours of
collection when stored at 2°C–8°C) or frozen (stored at ≤-70°C and tested within 30 days of
collection).
