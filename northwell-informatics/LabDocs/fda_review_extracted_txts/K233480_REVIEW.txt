IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Access SHBG assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) levels in human serum
and plasma (lithium heparin). The Access SHBG reagent pack is provided in the two assay packs
containing 50 tests per pack for 100 tests. This reagent pack consists of the following reagents:
• R1a (3.25 mL): Paramagnetic particles coated with mouse monoclonal anti-SHBG,
protein (bovine, mouse) buffered matrix, <0.1% sodium azide, 0.1% ProClin 300
• R1b (13.25 mL): Mouse monoclonal anti-SHBG alkaline phosphatase (bovine)
conjugate, buffered matrix with protein (bovine), <0.1% sodium azide, 0.1% ProClin 300
• R1c (9.86 mL): TRIS buffer with <0.1% sodium azide and 0.1% ProClin 300
Other materials needed to run the assay, but not included in the kit, include: Access SHBG
Calibrators, Quality Control (QC) materials, Lumi-Phos PRO, UniCel DxI Wash Buffer II, and
Access Wash Buffer II (optional material for dilution).
B Principle of Operation:
The Access SHBG assay is a sequential two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A
sample is added to a reaction vessel along with paramagnetic particles coated with monoclonal
anti-SHBG antibody and saline buffer with proteins. After incubation in a reaction vessel,
materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are
washed away. A second monoclonal anti-SHBG antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase is
added to the reaction vessel. After the second incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are
held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent
substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a
luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the
sample. Analyte concentration is automatically determined from a stored calibration.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability (within-run) and within-laboratory (total) precision were evaluated in
accordance with the CLSI Guideline EP05-A3. The study was run on three DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzers using three reagent lots and three calibrator lots. Five (5) serum
samples with SHBG concentrations spanning the analytical measuring interval were assayed
in duplicate in two runs per day over 20 days. Results from multiple lots were similar. The
results from one representative lot are provided in the table below:

Sample 5 80 198 3.0 1.5 3.4 1.5 2.3 1.2 5.1 2.6
2. Linearity:
Studies were performed using serum samples across the assay measuring range to evaluate
the linearity of the Access SHBG assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer in
accordance with the CLSI Guideline EP06-Ed2. The data was analyzed using a weighted
linear regression model.
The results of these linearity studies support that the Access SHBG assay is linear on the DxI
9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer throughout the proposed analytical measuring interval
of 0.33 nmol/L – approximately 200 nmol/L (up to the highest calibrator).

4. Assay Reportable Range:
See section VII.A.2 Linearity above.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was performed comparing the Access SHBG assay on the DxI
9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer to the Access SHBG assay on the Access 2
Immunoassay System using a protocol based on CLSI EP09c-A3. Patient samples falling
within the analytical measuring interval of the comparator device were evaluated. A total of
one hundred and fifty-one (151) samples were evaluated: 138 samples were individual native
serum samples, 3 samples were individual native serum samples supplemented with SHBG
antigen, 9 samples were pools of serum samples, and 1 was a serum sample depleted of
antigen. The study was run on three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers and three
Access 2 instruments with three reagent pack lots and three calibrator lots. The Passing-
Bablok regression analysis results between the candidate device (dependent variable, y) and
the comparator device (x, comparator), are shown below:
