A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Hardy Diagnostics’ Viral Transport Medium (VTM) is intended for the collection and transport
of clinical specimens for the preservation of viral agents including, Influenza A, Influenza B,
Adenovirus, and Echovirus from the collection site to the testing laboratory. Hardy Diagnostics’
VTM is a culture-based media that is intended to be used for standard laboratory procedures of
virus culture and diagnostic assays which utilize stable recoverable infectious viral particles.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Hardy Diagnostics Viral Transport Medium is a non-propagating transport media used for
the collection and transport of clinical specimens suspected of containing viruses for viral culture
and detection. The VTM consists of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, a buffer to maintain a neutral
pH, and fetal bovine serum, sucrose for specimen stabilization, along with Amphotericin B and
Gentamicin Sulfate to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth. VTM also contains a pH indicator
(phenol red) to provide a visual check on medium pH. The VTM appears translucent and light
peach in color.
The Hardy Diagnostics Viral Transport Medium includes a polypropylene screw-cap tube with
skirted conical bottom containing 3mL of transport medium. The product is supplied in multiple
configurations described in table 1 below: tubes alone, or in a kit format with a swab.

B Principle of Operation:
Clinical specimens are aseptically collected using swabs (polyester (Dacron), rayon, or flocked
nylon) and shafts (plastic or flexible wire) that are non-toxic to viral agents. Swabs with a scored
breakpoint at or less than 100 mm are recommended. The TransPRO Viral Transport Medium
(VTM) System includes an individually wrapped, sterile, mini-tip flocked swab with an 80mm

breakpoint. After collection of specimens, cap is removed from the tube and swab is inserted into
the media. The swab shaft is cut with scissors or broken off by bending the shaft at the scored
breakpoint against the rim of the tube. The us swab shaft is required to be below the rim of the
tube to facilitate proper cap closure of the tube. The tubes may then be stored or transported at
the permissible temperature.
Hardy Diagnostics’ VTM has the following ingredients.
• Hank’s Balanced Salts Solution (HBSS)
• Bovine Serum Albumin
• Amphotericin B
• Gentamicin Sulfate
• L-Glutamic Acid
• Sucrose
• Phenol Red
HBBS, bovine albumin, and sucrose provide stabilization to the specimen. Gentamicin Sulfate
and Amphotericin B inhibit bacterial and fungal contamination, respectively. Phenol red
functions as a pH indicator.

Shelf-life:
To evaluate Shelf-life, real-time stability studies were conducted with Hardy Diagnostics’
VTM lots in a real-time aging study at 2-8°C and 20-25°C. Three VTM lots were tested
qualitatively for appearance (e.g., visual inspection for turbidity, precipitation, color, etc.),
pH (acceptable range: 7.3 ± 0.2), fill volume (measured by weight), virus viability at every
month from 0 to 12 months. All results met the study acceptance criteria and support a shelf-
life stability of Hardy Diagnostics’ VTM for up to 12 months at 2-25°C.

Performance Testing - Recovery Studies:
The performance of Hardy Diagnostics Viral Transport Medium (VTM) was evaluated for
culture-based recovery of Influenza A, Influenza B, Echovirus, Adenovirus, and Respiratory
Syncytial Virus (RSV). Pooled negative clinical matrix was spiked with known concentration
of virus and then the contrived viral samples were transferred with swabs into subject VTM
and held at 2-8°C and 20-25°C for 0, 24, and 48 hours. The viral recovery study was
conducted with three variously aged lots of 3 ml VTM covering the claimed shelf-life. At the
end of each time point media stored under each temperature range, an aliquot of incubated
samples were serially diluted, and inoculated in triplicate into the susceptible host cell line.
After 24-72 hours, Viral quantification was determined by microscopic observation of virus
induced CPE to determine the fifty-percent tissue culture infective dose (TCID /mL) using
50
the Reed-Muench method. Results were considered acceptable if the average viral recovery
for each time point and storage condition demonstrate any percent changes within ±90% (i.e.,
1 log change) from baseline (T=0).
Table 2 and Table 3 below exhibit the viral recovery performance of the Hardy Diagnostics
Viral Transport Medium at 20-25°C and at 2-8°C respectively.
