C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
ARCHITECT i2000SR system
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) device includes the following:
• Microparticles - 1 Bottle (6.5 ml or 26.5 mL) Anti-holotranscobalamin (mouse,
monoclonal) antibody coated microparticles in HEPES buffer with surfactants. Minimum
concentration: 0.1% solids. Preservative: sodium azide.
• Conjugate - 1 Bottle (5.8 mL or 25.8 mL) Anti-transcobalamin antibody acridinium-
labeled conjugate in MES buffer with surfactants. Minimum concentration: 0.15 μg/mL.
Preservatives: Sarafloxacin and Nipasept.
Other materials needed to run the assay, but not included in the kit include: ARCHITECT
Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) calibrator kit and ARCHITECT Active-B12
(Holotranscobalamin) control kit.
B Principle of Operation:
The ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay is a two-step immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of Holotranscobalamin in human serum. In the first step, 70µL of
sample with 40µL buffer and anti-holotranscobalamin coated paramagnetic microparticles are
combined. Holotranscobalamin present in the sample binds to the anti-holotranscobalamin
coated microparticles. After washing, anti-transcobalamin acridinium-labeled conjugate is added
to create a reaction mixture in the second step. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and
trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is
measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct relationship exists between the amount of
Holotranscobalamin in the sample and the RLUs detected by the instrument.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A study was performed according to CLSI EP05-A3. Testing was conducted using 1 lot of
ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin), Calibrators, and Controls and 2 instruments.
Two levels of controls and 7 pooled native human serum samples spanning the analytical
measuring interval were assayed in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day, for 20 different days. The
data are summarized in the following table.

2. Linearity:
A study was performed based on CLSI EP06-Ed2. One high holotranscobalamin native serum
sample was diluted using calf serum across 11 dilution levels from 2.26 to 134.17 pmol/L. All
dilutions were assayed in replicates of five (5). Linearity was evaluated using linear regression
analysis. The deviation from linearity did not exceed 10% for samples across the range of LoQ to
128.0 pmol/L. The results of the linearity study support the claimed analytical measuring range
of 5.0-128.0 pmol/L.
Dilution Verification
A sample dilution study was conducted to support the claim that samples with
holotranscobalamin (HoloTC) concentrations >128 pmol/L can be diluted 1:2, either manually or
automatically by the device. The dilution study results support the sponsor’s labeling claims that
samples with HoloTC concentrations above 128 pmol/L may be diluted following the
instructions for use.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP07-ED3. Serum samples were spiked
into a minimum of two samples with HoloTC concentrations ranging from 20 to 45 pmol/L and
70 to 90 pmol/L. The samples were assayed, and the HoloTC concentrations of the spiked
samples were compared to control samples. No significant interference was defined as less than
10% difference between the mean of control and spiked samples.
The substances and the highest concentration tested which did not cause significant interference
are listed below.
Potential Interfering Substance Highest concentration tested at which no
significant interference is observed
Bilirubin (conjugated) 40 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 40 mg/dL
Biotin 4250 ng/mL
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL
Total Protein 15 g/dL
Triglycerides 850 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 70 IU/mL

Cross-Reactivity Study:
A cross reactivity study was performed to evaluate the potential cross-reactants,
apotranscobalamin and haptocorrin. Apotranscobalamin and haptocorrin were spiked into control
samples at approximately 500 pmol/L and 5000pmol/L, respectively. The samples were assayed
and the resulting % cross-reactivity was calculated using the following formula: % cross
reactivity = [(mean concentration of spiked samples in pmol/L) – (mean concentration of control
samples in pmol/L) / (concentration of cross reactant in pmol/L)] * 100%. The data are
summarized in the following table.

The sponsor has the following statements in their labeling:
“Do not use hemolyzed samples. Hemolyzed samples will cause erroneous results.”
“Samples containing concentrations of triglycerides at > 850 mg/dL, total protein at > 15 g/dL,
and/or rheumatoid factor at > 70 IU/mL may interfere with ARCHITECT Active-B12
(Holotranscobalamin) assay results.”
“Specimens from patients who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for
diagnosis or therapy may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). Specimens containing
HAMA may produce anomalous values when tested with assay kits such as ARCHITECT
Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) that employ mouse monoclonal antibodies.”
“Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins, interfering with
in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to animal serum products can be
prone to this interference, and anomalous values may be observed. Additional information may be
required for diagnosis.”
4. Assay Reportable Range:
5.0-128.0 pmol/L.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay is traceable to an internal reference
material which is traceable to another commercially available assay.

6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection, and Limit of Quantitation (LoB, LoD and LoQ) for the
ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay were evaluated following guidance in the
CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration of analyte which has within-
laboratory imprecision less than or equal to 10%. Results are summarized below.
LoB (pmol/L) LoD (pmol/L) LoQ (pmol/L)

7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A comparison study between the candidate ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin)
assay and the predicate ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay was
conducted according to the CLSI EP09C-ED3 guideline.
A total of 108 samples with HoloTC ranging from 5.4 to 128.0 pmol/L were collected and
evaluated: 105 samples were individual native serum samples and 3 samples were diluted
using calf serum to cover the low end of the measuring range. The data were analyzed using
Passing-Bablok regression and the comparison of the candidate ARCHITECT Active-B12
(Holotranscobalamin) assay (y) and the predicate ARCHITECT Active-B12
(Holotranscobalamin) assay (x), is summarized below:
N Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) Correlation Sample Range
Coefficient Tested (pmol/L)*
108 0.9 (0.85, 0.94) -0.50 (-3.44, 2.58) 0.95 (0.92, 0.96) 5.4 – 128.0
*As measured by the predicate.
2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted to support the use of the ARCHITECT Active-B12
assay with different sample matrices. Specifically, the study compared values obtained from
samples drawn into serum tubes with gel (SST) and serum tubes without gel (Serum clot). Paired
SST and Serum clot samples, with HoloTC concentrations ranging from 7.3 to 119.5 pmol/L,
were collected and tested. The following results were determined using Passing-Bablok
regression analysis: y=1.025X-0.819, R²=0.985.
The results support the sponsor’s claims that the assay is suitable for use with serum tubes with
gel (SST) and serum tubes without gel (Serum clot).
