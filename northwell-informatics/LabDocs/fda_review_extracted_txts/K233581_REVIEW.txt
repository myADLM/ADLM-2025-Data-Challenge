in the early detection of pregnancy.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITROS 5600 Integrated System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total β-hCG II Reagent Pack (test) is performed using
the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total β-hCG II Reagent and the VITROS Total β-hCG
II Calibrators on the VITROS 5600 Integrated System.
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total β-hCG II Reagent is comprised of the following:
- 100 coated wells (antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-β-hCG, binds >600 mIU hCG/well)
- 14.4 mL assay reagent (buffer containing mouse serum, bovine serum albumin, bovine
gamma globulin and antimicrobial agent)
- 19.2 mL conjugate reagent (HRP-mouse monoclonal anti-β-hCG, binds ≥4005 mIU
hCG/mL) in buffer with bovine serum albumin and antimicrobial agent
B Principle of Operation:
An immunometric immunoassay technique is used, which involves the reaction of human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) present in the sample with a microwell coated with biotinylated
antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-β-hCG) bound to streptavidin, and a Horseradish Peroxidase
(HRP)-labelled antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti-β-hCG). Unbound materials are
removed by washing.
The bound HRP-conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing
luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is
added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol
derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the
level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The
amount of HRP conjugate bound is directly proportional to the concentration of hCG present in
the sample.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the device was evaluated using procedures based on the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP05-A3 guideline.
A) 20-Day Precision Study
Six serum pools were prepared by pooling female serum samples to attain the desired
concentrations of hCG. Two replicates of each of the six samples were assayed in two runs
per day, over 20 days. Three reagent lots and one analyzer were used. Summary data of one
representative reagent lot is shown here:

were tested across each instrument, one lot per instrument, with five replicates per run, one
run per day, over five days. The within-run, between-day, between-instrument, and
reproducibility was calculated for each reagent lot. Results from multiple lots were similar.

2. Linearity:
Two linearity studies were performed using 10 serum samples each. Varying concentrations
of hCG were obtained by mixing low level serum samples and high level serum samples.
Both studies were performed using one lot of reagents on one analyzer.
In the first study, linearity was established by testing samples with concentrations ranging
from 38.6-15695 mIU/mL. Each sample was tested in 10 replicates. A regression analysis
was conducted resulting in the following linear regression equation:
y = 0.991x + 0.10, R2 = 0.996
In the second study, linearity was established by testing samples with concentrations ranging
from 1.51 to 51.18 mIU/mL. Each sample was tested in 10 replicates. A regression analysis
was conducted resulting in the following linear regression equation:
y = 1.025x + 0.07, R2 = 0.999
The results from the linearity studies support the reportable range of 2.39-15000 mIU/mL
(IU/L).
Dilution studies
Dilution studies were performed to determine the sample recovery after a 1:400 dilution
using VITROS High Sample Diluent B performed automatically by the analyzer. The
dilution study results support labeling claims that samples with hCG concentrations above
15,000 mIU/mL may be diluted 1:400 using VITROS High Sample Diluent B on-onboard the
analyzer.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The effect of potential interfering substances and cross-reacting substances on the
performance of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total β-hCG II Reagent were
evaluated based on recommendations in CLSI EP07 Third Edition.
A) Interference:
Three female human serum pool samples with approximately 5.00 mIU/mL (IU/L), 50.00
mIU/mL (IU/L) and 10,000 mIU/mL (IU/L) (“low”, "medium”, and “high” respectively)
hCG were spiked with various concentrations of potentially interfering substances. Each
sample was divided into two aliquots: test (with added interferent) and control (with no
added interferent) and measured in replicates of 5 across each of 3 reagent lots on one
instrument. No interference (>10% difference) was observed with the substances and

B) Cross reactivity:
Cross-reactivity of the VITROS Total β-hCG II reagent pack was determined using female
human serum samples with approximately 0 and 25 mIU/mL hCG concentrations that were
spiked with the following potential cross reactants: luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH), or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Samples were tested in
replicates of five using 3 lots of reagents on one analyzer.
Cross-reactivity at the 0 mIU/mL hCG concentration was calculated using the following
equation:
% cross-reactivity=Mean result of cross-reactant sample x 100
Concentration of cross-reactant
Cross-reactivity at the 25 mIU/mL hCG concentration was calculated using the following
equation:
% cross-reactivity= (Mean result of cross-reactant sample - Mean result of control sample) x 100
Concentration of cross-reactant
No cross-reactivity at the tested concentrations was detected at 0 mIU/mL hCG and the cross-
reactivity at the tested concentrations observed at 25 mIU/mL hCG is listed in the table below:

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay reportable range is 2.39 to 15,000 mIU/mL. See section VII.A.2 - Linearity and
section VII.A.6 - Detection Limit.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The VITROS Total β-hCG II Reagent Pack is traceable to the World Health Organization
(WHO) 4th International Standard Chorionic Gonadotropin, Human, National Institute for
Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), code 75/589.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Total β-hCG II Reagent Pack were determined using
procedures based on the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
For determination of the LoB, four analyte-free serum samples were tested in replicates of
five per run, with three lots of reagent, on one analyzer, over five days. The LoB was
determined to be 0.00 mIU/mL. The results supports the claimed LoB of 0.05 mIU/mL.
For determination of the LoD, five serum samples containing low analyte concentrations
(approximately 1 – 5 times LoB) were tested in replicates of 12 per day, using three reagent
lots, on one analyzer over 5 calendar days. The LoD was determined to be 0.21 mIU/mL. The
results support the claimed LoD of 0.70 mIU/mL.
For determination of the LoQ, four serum sample pools that contained low analyte
concentrations were used to evaluate the LoQ using the Total Error (<20%) approach. The
LoQ using the Total Error (<20%) approach was calculated to be 2.32 mIU/mL. The results
support the claimed LoQ of 2.39 mIU/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
