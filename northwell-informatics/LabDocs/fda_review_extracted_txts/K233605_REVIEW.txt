The ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG (EBVnaG) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the
qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA) in
human pediatric (2-21 years old) and adult serum and plasma (EDTA and lithium heparin) using
the ADVIA Centaur XP system. When used in conjunction with other EBV markers, this assay is
intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus infection, such as infectious
mononucleosis.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Not applicable
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The assay is intended for use on the fully automated ADVIA Centaur XP system manufactured
by Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG assay detects IgG antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus
nuclear antigen (EBNA) in adults and pediatric serum, EDTA plasma and Lithium-Heparin
Plasma. This assay is run on the fully automated ADVIA Centaur XP system. The results are
intended for use in conjunction with other EBV markers as an aid in the diagnosis of Epstein-
Barr virus infection, such as infectious mononucleosis.
The ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG assay kit consists of the following components:
- 1 ADVIA Centaur EBVnaG ReadyPack containing EBVnaG Lite Reagent, Solid Phase,
and Ancillary Well Reagent.
- 1 vial x 2.0 mL EBVnaG CAL low calibrator.
- 1 vial x 2.0 mL EBVnaG CAL high calibrator.
- ADVIA Centaur EBVnaG CAL calibrator assigned value cards and barcode labels.
- ADVIA Centaur EBVnaG master curve card.
- ADVIA Centaur Wash 1
The controls are available separately:
ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG Quality Control has the following:
- Negative control
- Positive control
B Principle of Operation:
K233605 - Page 2 of 15

--- Page 3 ---
The ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG is a fully automated 2-step sandwich immunoassay using
acridinium ester chemiluminescent technology. The specimen is incubated with the Ancillary
Well Reagent and the Solid Phase, which contains an EBV-EBNA IgG specific antigen.
Antigen-antibody complexes will form if anti-EBV-EBNA IgG antibody is present in the
specimen. The Lite Reagent contains monoclonal anti-human IgG labeled with acridinium ester
and is used to detect EBV-EBNA IgG in the specimen.
Assay Procedure:
The system automatically performs the following steps:
1. Dispenses 20 μL of sample into a cuvette.
2. Dispenses 250 μL of Solid Phase and 90 μL of Ancillary Well Reagent into a cuvette, then
incubates for 18 minutes at 37°C.
3. Performs a wash sequence using ADVIA Centaur Wash 1.
4. Dispenses 100 μL of Lite Reagent, then incubates for 18 minutes at 37°C.
5. Performs a wash sequence using ADVIA Centaur Wash 1.
6. Dispenses 300 μL of ADVIA Centaur Acid Reagent and 300 μL of ADVIA Centaur Base
Reagent to initiate the chemiluminescent reaction.
7. Reports results.
Results interpretation:
The system reports ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG assay results in Index values and as
Nonreactive or Reactive:
Nonreactive: < 1.00 Index value. These samples are considered negative.
Reactive: ≥ 1.00 Index value. These samples are considered positive.
Results of this assay should always be interpreted in conjunction with the patient’s medical
history, clinical presentation, and other findings.
C Instrument description Information
1. Instrument Name:
ADVIA Centaur XP System
2. Specimen Identification:
Serum, EDTA plasma, and lithium heparin plasma are the recommended specimen types for
the ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG Assay.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The assay needs 20 μL of sample for a single determination. The instrument performs all
handling procedures automatically.
K233605 - Page 3 of 15

--- Page 4 ---
4. Calibration information:
Calibration frequency is as stated below:
• At the end of the 28-day calibration interval.
• When changing lot numbers of primary reagent packs.
• When indicated by quality control results.
• After major maintenance or service, as indicated by quality control results.
Before initiating calibration on each new lot of reagents, the assay master curve values need
to be entered by scanning the master curve card.
5. Quality Control:
External positive and negative controls are available separately. According to the IFU, the
controls should be used at least once during each day that samples are analyzed. In addition,
quality control is performed:
• Following a valid calibration
• With use of a new lot of reagents
• When troubleshooting test results that do not match clinical conditions or symptoms
Acceptable performance is achieved when the analyte values obtained are within the
expected control interval for the system.

1. Cross reactivity:
Biokit evaluated potential cross-reactivity on the ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG by
testing at least 10 samples from individuals containing antibodies to other microorganisms or
with medical conditions unrelated to EBV infections. The data showed no cross reactivity
with various disease status tested except with 4 samples. Among those 4 samples, 2 samples
produced equivocal results by comparator device, the LIAISON EBNA IgG. The equivocal
results were interpreted as discrepant against candidate device. One sample each containing
HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG produced false nonreactive results (reactive on comparator device)
on the ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG test. The cross reactivity study results are presented
in Table 3.

* HSV-1 and HSV-2: For each cross reactants, one sample produced positive results by predicate device. Possible
cross reactivity cannot be excluded based on these results. The results should be interpreted in the clinical context
including signs, symptoms, and other laboratory information.
** Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG and HCV IgG: For each cross reactants, one sample gave EQV outcome on
predicate device which was taken as discordant with the ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG assay. Possible cross
reactivity cannot be excluded based on these results. The results should be interpreted in the clinical context
including signs, symptoms, and other laboratory information.
2. Interference study:
Biokit evaluated the potential interference of commonly found endogenous substances on the
ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG assay using negative, low positive and high positive
serum, EDTA plasma, and lithium heparin plasma samples. No interference was observed at
the tested interferents concentrations. The results for interference study are reported in Table
4.

A study to establish the ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG cut-off was performed using 393
intended use samples. The cut-off value was determined by performing concordance and
Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis, using predicate (LIAISON EBNA IgG)
results as the standard. The estimated cut-off value for ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG
assay was established as 1.0 Index value.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A total of 1428 leftover samples were collected over a contiguous time period from
individuals for whom an EBV test was ordered (population 1). Of these, 188 were from
unclassified serostatus individuals. One-hundred sixty-seven (167) samples with a known
negative result (population 2) were evaluated as well. Of these 14 were from unclassified
serostatus individuals. The study results otherwise showed that these populations included
individuals with acute infection, past infection, or no serologic evidence of EBV infection.
Testing was conducted at three sites in the U.S. representative of testing environments where
the candidate device will be used. Table 7 presents all individual samples tested in population
1 and 2 combined with age category.

2. Matrix Comparison:
The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of different sample matrices with the
ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG assay. This study evaluated ninety eight (98) sets of
matched samples of Serum (Serum Separator Tube) and EDTA plasma and 97 sets of
matched samples of Lithium Heparin plasma with the ADVIA Centaur EBV-EBNA IgG
assay on the ADVIA Centaur XP system for matrix equivalency. The samples were analyzed
by regression analysis as shown in Table 12.
The data showed that the sample matrices, serum (SST), EDTA plasma and Lithium-Heparin
plasma are comparable in performance.
