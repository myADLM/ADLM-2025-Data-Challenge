The assay is intended for use on the fully automated ADVIA Centaur XP manufactured by
Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ADVIA Centaur EBV-VCA IgM (EBVM) is a qualitative, serological, two-step sandwich
chemiluminescent immunoassay performed on the fully automated ADVIA Centaur XP system
intended for use in conjunction with other EBV markers as an aid in the diagnosis of Epstein-
Barr virus infection, such as infectious mononucleosis.
The ADVIA Centaur EBVM assay kit consists of the ReadyPack primary reagent pack
containing Lite Reagent, Solid Phase, and Ancillary Well Reagent, The ReadyPack ancillary
reagent pack containing Ancillary Reagent (diluent), and low and high calibrators. External
positive and negative controls are required to perform the assay and are available separately.
B Principle of Operation:
The ADVIA Centaur EBV-VCA IgM assay is a fully automated two-step sandwich
immunoassay using acridinium ester chemiluminescent technology. The specimen is incubated
with the Ancillary Well Reagent and the Solid Phase, which contains an EBV-VCA IgM specific
antigen, Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA) p18 (biotinylated peptide) coated onto streptavidin
magnetic microparticles. Antigen-antibody complexes will form if anti EBV-VCA IgM antibody
is present in the specimen. The Lite Reagent contains monoclonal anti-human IgM labeled with
acridinium ester and is used to detect EBV-VCA IgM in the specimen.
Index values for samples are determined automatically by software as ratio of the sample relative
light units (RLU) to the cutoff RLU and reported in Index Values and as Nonreactive or
Reactive:
• Nonreactive: < 1.00 Index. These samples are considered negative.
• Reactive: ≥ 1.00 Index. These samples are considered positive.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
ADVIA Centaur XP
K233606 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
2. Specimen Identification:
Serum, EDTA plasma, and lithium heparin plasma are the validated specimen types for the
ADVIA Centaur EBV-VCA IgM assay.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples in the primary collection device (serum stored on the clot, plasma stored on packed
red cells, and samples processed and stored in gel-barrier blood collection tubes) are stable
for up to 7 days at 2 - 8°C. Separated samples are stable for up to 4 hours at room
temperature, up to 7 days at 2 - 8°C, and up to one month at ≤ -20ºC with no more than one
freeze/thaw cycle. The assay requires 20 μL of sample for a single determination. The
instrument performs all handling procedures automatically.
4. Calibration:
The ADVIA Centaur EBVM assay kit includes two calibrators (high and low). Calibration is
performed as follows:
• At the end of the 28-day calibration interval.
• When changing lot numbers of primary reagent packs.
• When indicated by quality control results.
• After major maintenance or service, as indicated by quality control results
Before initiating calibration on each new lot of reagent, the assay master curve values need to
be entered by scanning the master curve card.
5. Quality Control:
External positive and negative controls are available separately. The controls should be used
at least once during each day that samples are analyzed. In addition, quality control is
performed:
• Following a valid calibration
• With use of a new lot of reagent
• When troubleshooting test results that do not match clinical conditions or symptoms
Acceptable performance is achieved when the analyte values obtained are within the
expected control interval for the system.

total of 353 samples confirmed to be EBV IgM-negative on a comparative assay and
positive for antibodies for 32 different diseases/conditions were tested in singlicate with
the candidate device on ADVIA Centaur XP system. The study results are presented in

2) Interference
Biokit evaluated the effect of the presence of commonly found endogenous substances on
the performance of the ADVIA Centaur EBV-VCA IgM using negative, low positive,
and high positive serum, EDTA plasma, and lithium heparin plasma contrived samples.
No interference (false positive or false negative) was observed at the tested
concentrations reported in Table 4.

8. Assay Cut-Off:
A study to establish the ADVIA Centaur EBV-VCA IgM cut-off was performed using 231
clinical human leftover remnant and intended use serum samples. The cut-off value was
determined by performing concordance and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC)
analysis, using predicate (DiaSorin Liaison EBV IgM) results as the standard. The estimated
cut-off value for ADVIA Centaur EBV-VCA IgM assay is 1.0 Index value.
9. Carry-Over:
The ADVIA Centaur EBV-VCA IgM is not susceptible to carry-over.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Biokit conducted a multisite study to evaluate clinical performance of the ADVIA Centaur
EBV-VCA IgM on the ADVIA Centaur XP system by determining Positive Percent
Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) with the predicate device,
DiaSorin Liaison EBV IgM. A total of 1,428 leftover samples were collected over a
contiguous time period from individuals for whom an EBV test was ordered (population 1).
Of these, 188 were from unclassified serostatus individuals. Two hundred and two (202)
samples with a known positive result (population 2) were evaluated as well. Of these 4 were
from unclassified serostatus individuals. The study results otherwise showed that these
populations included individuals with acute infection, past infection, or no serologic evidence
of EBV infection. Testing was conducted at three sites in the U.S. representative of testing
environments where the candidate device will be used. The results are presented in Tables 7
and 8:

those, 48 samples were positive on the ADVIA Centaur EBVM assay. The PPA in primary
acute patients is therefore 90.57% with 95% CI of 79.75% - 95.90%. Primary acute in this
study is defined as the presence of either EBV IgM or heterophile antibodies, and absence of
EBNA IgG.
