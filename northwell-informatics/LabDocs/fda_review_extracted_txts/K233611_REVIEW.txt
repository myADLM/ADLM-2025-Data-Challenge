1 The SPOTFIRE R Panel is available as a standalone assay (K213954) or as a selectable option within the
SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel (K232954) based on the type of specimen to be tested.
2 The SPOTFIRE ST Panel is available as a selectable option within the SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel (K232954) based
on the type of specimen to be tested.
3 For patient samples, the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel (K213954) and R/ST Panel (K232954) report a single
result for all 4 seasonal Coronavirus species in combination; for Quality Control testing, the assay for each
individual seasonal Coronavirus must produce the expected result.
4 In common with the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel (K213954) and R/ST Panel (K232954), the BIOFIRE
SPOTFIRE R Panel Mini (K230719) cannot distinguish Human Rhinovirus and Enterovirus; however, to simplify
the test report, the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel Mini refers to both analytes as Human Rhinovirus
5 For patient samples, the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R Panel (K213954) and R/ST Panel (K232954) report a single
result for all 4 Parainfluenza Virus serotypes in combination; for Quality Control testing, the assay for each
individual Parainfluenza Virus serotype must produce the expected result.
B Principle of Operation:
The SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls are processed according to the instructions
for quality control testing provided by the manufacturer of the applicable BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE
Panel assays (Respiratory/Sore Throat (R/ST) [K232954], Respiratory (R) [K213954] and
Respiratory (R) Mini [K230719]). Results are reported automatically by the BIOFIRE
SPOTFIRE Panel Software as either “PASS”, “FAIL” or “INVALID [failure reason]”.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and reproducibility of results obtained with the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and
Negative Controls was evaluated using different batches of finished material that were tested
with multiple lots of BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel reagents, over multiple days, with
multiple operators and using multiple BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Systems. Three lots of
SPOTFIRE RSP Positive Controls and 4 lots of SPOTFIRE RSP Negative Controls were
included in the study, as described below.
External Sites
Testing was performed at 5 sites that were representative of the Intended Use
environment for the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel (i.e., sites performing near-patient
testing). The SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls were tested according to
the BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel instructions for use as intended during normal, day-
to-day operations (e.g., training a new operator, upon receipt of new reagents or a new
instrument, or following instrument service). The number of control panels tested varied
by site according to the number of operators and volume of BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST
Panel testing performed. A total of 37 BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE Systems was used across the
5 study sites in conjunction with 25 lots of BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel pouches.
Internal Maine Molecular Site
Testing of the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls internally at Maine
Molecular Quality Controls (MMQC) was performed over multiple days on a single
BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE System by 3 operators using 3 lots of control panels and 3 lots of
BIOFIRE SPOTFIRE R/ST Panel pouches.
In total, 361 controls were tested across all sites, including 179 Positive Controls and 182
Negative Controls (Table 2). There were 10 invalid results affecting 7 Positive Controls and
3 Negative Controls (7 due to internal pouch control failure and 3 due to instrument errors).
All controls with invalid results were repeated yielding a total of 351 valid control results
(172 Positive Controls and 179 Negative Controls). One Positive Control failed because
negative results were obtained for 4 of the target analytes. All other control results were as
expected. The overall Positive Control failure rate was 0.6% (1/172).
The reproducibility and precision of the SPOTFIRE RSP Positive and Negative Controls was
acceptable.
