IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The HCG One Step Pregnancy Test Strip OTC, HCG One Step Pregnancy Test Strip Rx, HCG
One Step Pregnancy Test Midstream OTC and HCG One Step Pregnancy Test Midstream Rx are
lateral flow immunoassays for the qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).
The tests are available in two formats: 1) The midstream format, which consists of a single test
strip assembled in a plastic card, with an absorbent tip, and 2) the strip format, which is a single
test strip. The strip format tests (HCG One Step Pregnancy Test Strip OTC and HCG One Step
Pregnancy Test Strip Rx) are exactly the same and the midstream format tests (HCG One Step
Pregnancy Test Midstream OTC and HCG One Step Pregnancy Test Midstream Rx) are exactly
the same.
B Principle of Operation:
The tests are rapid, one-step lateral flow immunoassays that utilize a combination of antibodies
including a monoclonal hCG antibody to qualitatively detect hCG in human urine samples. The
tests come in two formats, the midstream format and the strip format. Testing is conducted by
immersing the absorbent tip in urine (midstream format and strip format) or urinating on the
absorbent tip (midstream format) and obtaining the result from the colored lines.
K233624 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
After application of the urine specimen, the hCG within the urine reacts with the anti-βhCG
antibody-colloidal gold conjugate to form a compound. The compound is captured by the anti-
αhCG antibody immobilized on the test area, then a colored line will form in the test line region.
A colored line will always develop in the control line region if sufficient sample volume has
been applied to the test strip. The test result is shown in the result window and read visually 3-10
minutes after urine application. Two distinct colored lines, one line in the control line region and
another in the test line region, indicate a positive test result (pregnant). Absence of a colored line
in the test line region and only a colored line in the control line region indicates a negative test
result (not pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the control line region, even in the presence of
a colored line in the test line region, indicates an invalid test result.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Urine samples from non-pregnant females (negative) were spiked with the hCG WHO 6th IS
reference material to provide seven urine samples with hCG concentrations of 0, 12.5, 18.75,
25, 37.5, 50 and 100 mIU/mL. Each sample was tested using 3 lots of each device (i.e., the
strip format and the midstream format of the test). Testing on the midstream format was
performed using both the dip sampling method and midstream sampling method. Tests were
performed in replicates of 2 per day, at 3 sites, by 3 operators, over 15 days for each sample
concentration. A total of 90 replicates were tested at each hCG concentration for each format
of the device. The sensitivity was determined to be 25mIU/mL hCG. The results are
summarized in the tables below:

2. Linearity:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-Reactivity
The candidate devices were tested for potential cross-reactivity from luteinizing hormone (LH),
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). A pooled human
urine sample was used to prepare samples with hCG levels of 0 mIU/mL, 25 mIU/mL and 100
mIU/mL that were then spiked with each cross reactant up to the following concentrations: 750
mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH or 1 mIU/mL TSH. Spiked samples were tested in replicates of
15 using 3 lots of the candidate device for each format (5 replicates per lot). The results
demonstrated no cross reactivity with FSH at 1000mIU/mL, and TSH at 1 mIU/mL. The highest
concentration of LH at which no cross-reactivity was observed was 500 mIU/mL.
Interference Study
To evaluate potential interference, urine samples from non-pregnant females were used to
prepare hCG negative (0 mIU/mL hCG) and positive (25 mIU/mL hCG) samples that were then
spiked with final concentrations of the potential interferents listed in table below. For each
substance, 15 replicates were tested on 3 device lots (5 replicates tested by each lot). The results
demonstrated no interference from substances at the concentrations shown in the table below.

Effect of hCG β-core fragment
Urine samples from non-pregnant females were used to prepare samples with hCG levels of 0
mIU/mL (negative samples) and 25 mIU/mL (positive samples). The positive and negative
samples then were spiked with hCG β-core fragment at concentrations of 62,500, 125,000,
250,000, 500,000, 1,000,000 pmol/L. All samples were tested in 15 replicates on 3 device lots (5
replicates per lot). The results demonstrated that the candidate devices are not affected by
concentrations of hCG β-core fragment up to 1,000,000 pmol/L.
Effect of urine pH
To evaluate potential interference from changes in urine pH, urine samples containing 0 mIU/mL
and 25 mIU/mL hCG were tested in 15 replicates on 3 lots of device (5 replicates per lot) using
samples at pH values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0. The results demonstrated that samples
within the pH range of 4.0 to 9.0 do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the
devices.
Effect of urine specific gravity
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, urine samples containing 0
mIU/mL and 25 mIU/mL hCG were adjusted to specific gravities of 1.000, 1.015, 1.018, 1.020,
1.022, 1.026, 1.031, 1.035 and tested in 15 replicates on 3 lots of the device (5 replicates per lot).
The results demonstrated that changes in specific gravity, ranging from 1.000-1.035, do not
interfere with either positive or negative results from the devices.
High dose hook effect study
To evaluate high dose hook effect, negative urine sample spiked with hCG at 25 mIU/mL, 100
mIU/mL, 500 mIU/mL, 1,000 mIU/mL, 100,000 mIU/mL, 500,000 mIU/mL, 1,000,000
