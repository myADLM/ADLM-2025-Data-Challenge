III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Lingo Glucose System is an over-the-counter (OTC) integrated Continuous Glucose
Monitor (iCGM) intended to continuously measure, record, analyze and display glucose values
in people 18 years and older not on insulin. The Lingo Glucose System helps to detect
euglycemic and dysglycemic glucose levels. The Lingo Glucose System may also help the user
better understand how lifestyle and behavior modification, including diet and exercise, impact
glucose excursion.
The user is not intended to take medical action based on the device output without consultation
with a qualified healthcare professional.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
Do not use the Lingo Biosensor if you are on dialysis or critically ill. It is not known how

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Lingo Glucose System is a home use device that is intended to continuously measure the
glucose in the interstitial fluid, calculate the glucose reading and make this value available to the
user. The Lingo System can reliably and securely transmit glucose measurement data to
authorized digitally connected devices. The system is not intended to be used in conjunction with
insulin devices such as insulin pens and Automated Insulin Dosing (AID) systems. The Lingo
Glucose System includes the Lingo Glucose Biosensor and the Lingo App.
Lingo Biosensor
The Lingo Glucose Biosensor hardware and technology is based on the FDA-cleared FreeStyle
Libre 2 (FSL2) sensor (K222447). The Biosensor is a single use disposable on-body Biosensor
K233655 - Page 2 of 15

--- Page 3 ---
that incorporates a subcutaneously implanted electrochemical glucose sensor and associated
electronics. The Biosensor can be worn for up for 14 days and transmits data to the Lingo App
via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
Lingo App (iOS)
The Lingo App is designed to work in conjunction with the Lingo Glucose Biosensor. The Lingo
App, which is the primary display for the Lingo System, operates on an iOS-compatible mobile
device and can be downloaded from the Apple App Store.
B Principle of Operation:
The Lingo Glucose System uses an electrochemical sensor to monitor glucose levels in the
interstitial fluid (ISF). The sensor is held in place with an adhesive pad and incorporates both the
subcutaneously implanted sensor and associated electronics. The sensor uses a glucose oxidase
enzyme to oxidize glucose and transfer electrons to an electrode, producing a current. The
strength of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the ISF. The system
converts the electrical current signal to a glucose value (in mg/dL) for display to the user on a
display device.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
iCGM performance was evaluated using leveraged clinical studies from the predicate as the
sensor component is identical. A new statistical analysis was performed to account for the
different age range (predicate device is 2 years and older; subject device is 18 years and
older), the truncated glucose measuring range (predicate device is 40 – 400 mg/dL; subject
device is 55 – 200 mg/dL) and the shortened wear period (predicate device is 15 days;
subject device is 14 days).
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
iCGM performance was evaluated in clinical studies described below in section C(3).
Subjects wore two sensors concurrently, one on the back of each upper arm, to evaluate
device precision.
In the study for all users, the mean paired absolute relative difference (between
the 2 concurrently worn devices) was 8.4 %; and the median coefficient of variation (median
%CV) was 4.2 %; mean %CV was 5.9%.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
The clinical data of the predicate FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System
(K222447) was reanalyzed to support the Lingo Glucose System.
The accuracy performance was assessed in a single pivotal clinical study conducted in the
United States at seven centers.
The study enrolled 150 adult subjects with diabetes. Subjects wore two sensors for up to 16
consecutive days following Sensor application and accuracy analysis is based on the first
applied sensor to each subject only. Subjects took part in up to three ten-hour clinical
sessions that took place during four distinct periods: Days 1 to 3; Days 5 to 7; Days 9 to 11,
and Days 13 to 15. During each clinic session, each subject’s glucose was manipulated to
observe data spanning the measuring range. Data from day 15 of wear are not considered in
the following analyses.
Device accuracy was evaluated by comparing iCGM glucose values to glucose values from
venous blood draws measured with an FDA-cleared laboratory grade comparator method
(YSI 2300). Glucose values were obtained from the system and from the comparator at the
same or similar time. Glucose values outside of the subject device measuring range are not
included in the following analysis. Absolute differences in mg/dL of values compared to the
comparator method were calculated for all values below 70 mg/dL. For values of 70 mg/dL
and above, percentage differences compared to the comparator method were calculated.

Trend Accuracy
Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose
and is characterized by slopes, such as from > 2mg/dL/min to < -2 mg/dL/min. Trend
accuracy was assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change from the iCGM
and the corresponding comparator values for each iCGM-comparator measurement pair.

Agreement when iCGM Reads “< 55 mg/dL” or “> 200 mg/dL”
The Lingo Glucose System reports glucose readings between 55 and 200 mg/dL. When the
system determines the sensor reading is below 55 mg/dL, it displays “< 55 mg/dL” on the
mobile app. When the system determines the sensor reading is above 200 mg/dL, it displays
“> 200 mg/dL” on the mobile app. Because the system does not display glucose values below
55 mg/dL or above 200 mg/dL, the comparisons to the actual blood glucose levels (as
determined by the comparator method) when the iCGM value is classified as “< 55 mg/dL”
or “ > 200 mg/dL” is evaluated separately, and the cumulative percentages of when the
comparator values were less than certain glucose values (for “< 55 mg/dL”) and when
comparator values were greater than certain values (for “> 200 mg/dL”) are presented in the
tables below.

Sensor Stability
Sensor stability describes the performance of the sensor over the sensor lifetime. Sensors can
be worn for up to 14 days. Performance was estimated by calculating the mean of the
absolute relative differences between iCGM and comparator measurement and percentage of
device readings within 15 mg/dL or 15 % (15/15%), 20 mg/dL or 20 % (20/20%) and 40
mg/dL or 40 % (40/40%) of the comparator values during the beginning, early middle, late
middle, and end of the wear period. These times were defined as follows:
• Beginning (Days 1, 2 or 3)
• Early Middle (Days 5, 6 or 7),
• Late Middle (Days 9, 10 or 11), and
• End (Days 13 or 14).
The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and agreement rates with the comparator
method were evaluated over 14 day life of the sensor.

Sensor Life
The sensor can be worn for up to 14 days. 151 Sensors were evaluated on the adult subjects
to determine how many days of readings each Sensor provided.
Of the 151 sensors, 77.1% lasted until the final day of use. Some sensors were excluded from
the analysis. For example, 4 sensors were intentionally removed due to subjects withdrawing
or dropped out from the study early, one of which occurred during day 1 of the study. Of the
sensors that did not last until the final day of use, 4 sensors (2.6%) had “early sensor shut-
off” where the sensor algorithm detected that the sensor did not function as intended and
automatically ended a sensor session. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate how
long a sensor will work over the wear duration.

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing was performed for the Lingo Glucose System to
verify that the system is able to withstand the electromagnetic interference and emissions in
compliance with IEC 60601-1-2 and IEC CISPR 11. Wireless coexistence testing was performed
to confirm that the sensor remains functional and perform within acceptable limits while in the
presence of common radiating electronic devices in accordance with FDA Guidance “Radio
Frequency Wireless Technology in Medical Devices.” The subject device underwent coexistence
testing consistent with AAMI TIR69 and ANSI C63.27 and included test challenges from in-
band interference sources defined in ANSI C63.27 as well as other expected wireless
interference sources from the intended use environment. The Lingo Glucose System also
successfully demonstrated compliance with Federal Communication Commission (FCC)
Regulations Part 15.225 and Part 15.247, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory
Circular RTCA DO-160.
