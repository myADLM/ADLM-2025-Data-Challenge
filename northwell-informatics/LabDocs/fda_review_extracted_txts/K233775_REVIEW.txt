III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Vivatmo pro nitric oxide test is a portable, non-invasive device to measure fractional exhaled
nitric oxide (FeNO) in human breath.
FeNO is increased in some airway inflammatory processes, such as asthma, and often decreases
in response to anti-inflammatory treatment. Measurement of FeNO by Vivatmo pro is a method
to measure the decrease in FeNO concentration in asthma patients that often occurs after
treatment with anti-inflammatory pharmacological therapy as an indication of therapeutic effect
in patients with elevated FeNO levels. FeNO measurements are to be used as an adjunct to
established clinical assessments.
Vivatmo pro is suitable for children, approximately 7-17 years, and adults 18 years and older.
Testing using the Vivatmo pro should only be done in a point-of-care healthcare setting under
professional supervision. Vivatmo pro should not be used in critical care, emergency care or in
anesthesiology.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Regardless of displayed measured results, monitor signs or symptoms of chest tightness,
shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing for decisions about treatment. Do not use the device
for subjects suffering from acute upper or lower respiratory infection disease or with current
serious medical conditions (other than asthma).
Vivatmo pro should not be used in critical care, emergency care or in anesthesiology. The
following conditions can influence correct measurement of results and shall be avoided: smoking
or tobacco consumption for at least 1 hour before the measurement, eating or drinking at least 1
hour before the measurement, especially nitrate rich food (e.g., spinach), strenuous exercise, use
of rescue inhaler or leukotriene modifier 1h before measurement.
The device is not indicated for children under the age of 7 years of age including infants, or by
patients who are unable to understand and execute the instructions given by healthcare providers,
as measurement requires patient cooperation.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Vivatmo Pro
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Vivatmo pro device is comprised of the following main components:
K233775 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
1. A Vivatmo pro handheld, which holds the measuring module with electronics, display
and the rechargeable battery. The handheld includes software to drive the handheld.
2. A Vivatmo pro basestation, which consists of a cradle to charge the Vivatmo pro
handheld and a single board computer to run the Vivatmo pro software driving the touch
screen and the interfaces. The basestation is provided with an external power supply.
3. The Vivatmo pro software that runs on the Vivatmo pro basestation.
4. A Vivatmo pro Oxycap, which is a disposable mouthpiece holding filters, desiccant and
converter materials to prepare the exhaled breath for the measurement. Vivatmo pro
Oxycap is for single use and must be replaced for every new patient and measurement
occasion.
5. A Vivatmo pro Level 0 accessory, a disposable mouthpiece with filters, desiccant and
reagent to remove NO to facilitate a measurement with 0 ppb FeNO for QC purposes.
B Principle of Operation:
Vivatmo pro nitric oxide test is a portable, non-invasive device to measure fractional exhaled
nitric oxide (FeNO) in human breath.
The measurement procedure of the Vivatmo pro generates the fraction of the exhaled breath
(FeNO). The last 3 second fraction of a 10 second exhalation is evaluated for average NO
concentration. The exhalation flow is controlled to 50 ml/s ±5 ml/s at an applied pressure of
10 to 20 cm H2O.
The measurement method of Vivatmo pro is Chemical field effect transistor (Chem-FET).
The measurement sample is internally taken after a bypass time period and directly
forwarded onto the sensor. The nitrogen dioxide molecules are adsorbed on the sensor layer
and the change in the binding energy creates an electrical signal, which is transferred into a
quantifiable measurement signal. The nitrogen dioxide is converted from Nitric oxide in the
breath by a potassium permanganate converter in the disposable mouthpiece.
NO2 is measured using Chem-FET detection with NO2 molecules accumulated to a sensitive
layer changing the electrical field of the capacitor. The drop of voltage is proportional with the
number of NO2 molecules accumulated.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Vivatmo Pro
2. Specimen Identification:
The healthcare professional assists the patient, who performs the test in real-time and is
identified by patient name
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user obtains a breath sample by having the subject exhale into the device.
K233775 - Page 3 of 9

--- Page 4 ---
4. Calibration:
The manufacturer performs calibration for each Vivatmo Pro device. Recalibration by the
user is not possible.
5. Quality Control:
QC is recommended weekly or after 50 measurements if Vivatmo pro is used in a clinical
environment or point-of-care healthcare setting under professional supervision.

Clinical Precision
Clinical precision was assessed by studying the device in 65 children and 78 adults (143
subjects). At least 2 FeNO measurements per subject were collected by a total of 16 operators
across seven different clinical sites.
Clinical repeatability was assessed together with the 95%-confidence interval as pooled
standard deviation (mean of measurement pair within visit < 50 ppb) and CV (mean of
measurement pair within visit ≥ 50 ppb), respectively, using the residual variance component
resulting from a random effects ANOVA (as used in CLSI EP05 guideline). Results are
summarized in the table below.

2. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated within one single run, measuring a range of concentrations above
and below the claimed measuring range with the concentrations known relative to each other.
In total, nine NO concentrations and a negative control were tested in the following order: 50
ppb, 10 ppb, 300 ppb, 5 ppb, 100 ppb, 0 ppb, 150 ppb, 25 ppb, 330 ppb, 3 ppb, 3 ppb, 3 ppb.
For the determination of the linear range, the slope and r² coefficient of the linear fit of
measurement values plotted against NO concentration in the claimed range of 5 - 300 ppb
NO were calculated:

Clinical Accuracy
A study was also performed to assess the clinical accuracy of the device. A total of 161
patients (n= 106 adults and n=55 children) participated in a longitudinal study where
measurements for FeNO, spirometry, and asthma control questionnaires were completed at
baseline (Visit 1) and two weeks later (Visit 2) after therapeutic agents were administered.
For those with elevated initial FeNO levels >30 ppb for adults and > 25 ppb for children
(total n=95), there was a fall in mean FeNO measured by Vivatmo Pro in patients with
elevated FeNO levels for combined adult and pediatric treatment populations. Results
showed a mean change of -39.1 ppb (-41.6%) with a mean SD of 43.9.
The decline in FeNO after 2 weeks of corticosteroid therapy resulted in the following
changes in subjective and objective asthma measures.
• ACQ: Mean ACQ score fell by -51.1 % after corticosteroids
• FEV1: There was a mean FEV1 change of 6.9 % after corticosteroids
D Clinical Cut-Off:
