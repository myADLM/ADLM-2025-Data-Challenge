III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
The Alinity i Toxo IgM assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) used
for the qualitative detection of IgM antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in human serum, serum
separator, and plasma tubes (lithium heparin, lithium heparin separator, and tripotassium EDTA)
on the Alinity i system.
The Alinity i Toxo IgM assay is to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or recent
Toxoplasma gondii infection in suspected individuals including women of child-bearing age. It is
recommended that the assay be performed in conjunction with a Toxoplasma gondii IgG assay.
The Alinity i Toxo IgM assay has not been cleared for use in screening blood, plasma, or tissue
donors.
B Indication(s) for Use:
NA
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Performance has not been established for the use of bodily fluids other than human serum or
plasma.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Alinity i system
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Alinity i system is a fully automated immunoassay analyzer using chemiluminescent
microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology. The Alinity i Toxo IgM immunoassay requires
the use of Alinity i Toxo IgM Reagent Kit (cartridges, microparticles, and conjugate), Alinity i
Toxo IgM Calibrator, and the Alinity i Toxo IgM Controls (positive and negative). The Alinity i
Toxo IgM immunoassay components, reagent kit, calibrator and controls are packaged separately
and designed to be used on the Alinity i system.
B Principle of Operation:
The Alinity i Toxo IgM assay is an automated, two-step immunoassay for the qualitative
detection of IgM antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in human serum and plasma using
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology.
Pre-diluted sample and anti-human IgM murine monoclonal antibody coated paramagnetic
microparticles are combined and incubated. Together with IgM antibodies of other specificities,
anti-Toxo specific IgM present in the sample binds to the anti-human IgM murine monoclonal
K233932 - Page 2 of 14

--- Page 3 ---
antibody coated microparticles, forming an antibody-antibody complex. The mixture is washed.
A conjugate complex consisting of an acridinium-labeled anti-Toxo p30 antigen murine
monoclonal F(ab')2 fragment and native Toxoplasma gondii lysate, containing the p30 antigen, is
added to create a reaction mixture and incubated. This conjugate complex is bound by anti-Toxo
specific IgM that has been captured by the anti-human IgM murine monoclonal antibody coated
microparticles, forming an antibody-antibody-conjugate complex. Following a wash cycle, Pre-
Trigger and Trigger Solutions are added.
The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit (RLU). There is a
direct relationship between the amount of anti-Toxo IgM in the sample and the RLU detected by
the system optics. The presence or absence of anti-Toxo IgM in the sample is determined by
comparing the chemiluminescent RLU in the reaction to the cutoff RLU determined from an
active calibration.
The cutoff is 1.00 S/CO. The Alinity i system automatically calculates the signal-to-cutoff
(S/CO) ratios, and interprets the results as presented in Table 1.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The cut-off for the Alinity i Toxo IgM assay was established using samples characterized
with a commercially available anti-Toxo IgM assay. A total of 1219 samples (1053 anti-Toxo
IgM nonreactive samples, and 166 anti-Toxo IgM reactive samples) were included. A
receiver-operating characteristic analysis supports a cut-off of 1.00 S/CO (with a grayzone
from 0.83 to 1.00 S/CO).

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison:
Clinical Agreement:
A clinical study was conducted to evaluate the clinical performance of the Alinity i Toxo
IgM assay. To evaluate the percent agreement between the Alinity i Toxo IgM assay and an
FDA-cleared, commercially available anti-Toxo IgM assay with samples collected from two
populations. Population 1 was comprised of 897 consecutively collected remnant specimens
sent to a laboratory for anti-Toxo IgM testing including specimens collected in the US (n =
169) and outside of the US (n = 710), and Population 2 was comprised of 207 consecutively
collected remnant specimens from pregnant women sent to a laboratory for anti-Toxo IgM
testing in the US.
Demographic information for specimens collected in the US from Population 1 and 2 is
shown in the Table 8 below (n=376).

Alinity I Toxo IgM assay and an FDA-cleared was calculated for each population
separately and are shown in Tables 9 and 10 below.

bTwenty seven specimens from Population 1 were from pregnant females and therefore, were also
included in the Population 2.
CDC Panel study:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Toxoplasma 1998 Human Serum
Panel was tested using the Alinity i Toxo IgM assay. The Alinity i Toxo IgM assay results
were submitted to the CDC for data analysis and for the result interpretation for each sample.
The panel consisted of 32 true positive Toxoplasma specimens and 65 true negative
Toxoplasma specimens. The Alinity i Toxo IgM assay reported the 32 positive specimens as
reactive and the 65 negative specimens, as nonreactive. The positive percent agreement

The results are presented as a means to convey further information on the performance of this
assay with a masked, characterized serum panel. This does not imply endorsement of the
assay by the CDC.
2. Matrix Equivalency:
A study was performed to evaluate whether specific blood collection tube types are suitable
for use with the Alinity i Toxo IgM assay.
The matrix collection tube type equivalency study was conducted including 43 donors of
reactive (20 donors) and nonreactive (23 donors) samples in 5 types of blood collection
tubes; serum, serum separator, lithium heparin plasma, lithium heparin plasma (separator
tube), and K3 EDTA plasma for use with the Alinity i Toxo IgM assay. Data was analyzed
using regression comparing numerical S/CO value results of all matrices to serum.
All of the blood collection tube types tested are acceptable for use with the Alinity i Toxo
IgM assay.
