The package insert of the device contains the warning: “CA15-3 antigen levels in a given
specimen determined with assays from different manufacturers can vary due to differences in
assay methods and reagent specificity. Results reported by the laboratory to the physician must
include the identity of the assay used to measure CA15-3 antigen levels. Values obtained with
different assays cannot be used interchangeably. Before changing assays, the laboratory must
confirm baseline values for patients being serially monitored.”
D Special Instrument Requirements:
IMMULITE 2000 Systems Analyzer (K970227)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA consists of the reagent pack. Each reagent pack is for 200 tests and
contains:
• BR-MA Bead Pack (1 pack, 200 beads/pack): coated with anti-CA15-3 murine
monoclonal antibody
• BR-MA Reagent Wedge:
Well 1 (11.5 mL): serum-based buffer, with preservative
o
Well 2 (11.5 mL): alkaline phosphatase (bovine calf intestine) conjugated to
o
murine monoclonal anti-CA15-3 antibody in buffer, with preservative
• BR-MA Adjustors (Low and High; 2 vials, 3 mL/vial): lyophilized CA15-3 in a
nonhuman serum matrix, with preservative; Reconstitute each vial with 3.0 mL distilled
or deionized water.
Materials Provided Separately:
• Multi-Diluent 2
• Chemiluminescent Substrate Module
K233946 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
• Probe Wash
• Probe Cleaning Kit
• Disposable Reaction Tubes, Sample Diluent Test Tubes, Sample Diluent Tube Caps
The manufacturer recommends the use of commercially available quality control materials or
sample pools with at least two levels (low and high) of CA15-3.
To mitigate the risk of biotin interference, the IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA reagent pack has been
modified from the previously cleared assay, which was susceptible to interference from biotin.
B Principle of Operation:
The IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA is a two-step sequential solid-phase chemiluminescent
immunometric assay. There are two incubation cycles of 30 minutes each. During the initial 30-
minute cycle, the patient sample is incubated with a biotinylated antibody coated bead and buffer
(reagent wedge well 1). The biotinylated antibody on the bead captures the antigen in the patient
sample. On completion of the first 30-minute cycle, unbound sample/buffer mixture is removed
via a centrifugal wash. During the second 30-minute cycle, alkaline phosphatase antibody
conjugate in buffer (reagent wedge well 2) is added to complete the bead pair immunocomplex
sandwich consisting of capture Ab-antigen-detection Ab. On completion of the second 30-minute
cycle, unbound conjugate is removed by centrifugal wash. The amount of alkaline phosphatase
bound is directly proportional to the analyte in the patient sample. Following the two 30-minute
incubation periods, IMMULITE chemiluminescent substrate is added for a further 5-minute
incubation period to generate the luminogenic reaction. The chemiluminescent substrate
undergoes hydrolysis in the presence of the alkaline phosphatase to yield an unstable
intermediate, which then emits photons. The sustained emissions are measured by the
luminometer. The resulting relative light units (RLU) are proportional to the concentration of CA
15-3 in the sample, which is expressed as U/mL. The CA15-3 concentration in the serum is
determined from a reagent lot specific calibration curve that is correlated to the individual
instrument using supplied high and low adjustors.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The studies were performed following CLSI EP05-A3.
Within-laboratory precision
Five native pooled serum samples were assayed in two replicates per sample per run, two
runs per day for 20 days using one lot of modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay on one
IMMULITE 2000 analyzer (n=80 per sample). Samples 1 and 2 were prepared by mixing
native serum samples from two individual patients while samples 3-5 were prepared by
mixing native pooled serum samples into an individual native serum specimen. The data was
analyzed using ANOVA for standard deviation (SD), % coefficient of variation (%CV) to
evaluate within-run, between-run, between-day, and within-laboratory attributes for each
sample. The results are summarized in the following table:

Lot-to-lot imprecision
The study was performed at a single site with three assay lots. Samples 1-5, described above,
were tested on one IMMULITE 2000 analyzer for five days, with five replicates per sample
per run per day (N = 75 per sample). The data was analyzed using ANOVA for SD, %CV to
evaluate within-run (repeatability), between-day, between-lot, reproducibility (total
precision) attributes for each sample. The results are summarized in the following table:

2. Linearity:
The linearity study was conducted following CLSI EP06-Ed2. A panel of 10 dilution levels
was prepared by mixing a high CA 15-3 pooled serum native sample with a low CA 15-3
native single serum sample to cover the claimed analytical measuring range of the
IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay. Four replicates per sample were tested using three reagent
lots on one IMMULITE 2000 analyzer. The data was analyzed using weighted least squares
linear regression. Percent deviations from linearity were calculated as differences between
the observed values (mean values) and the predicted values divided by the predicted values.

The data support the linearity interval from 0.72 to 404.92 ng/mL with the deviations from
linearity within ±10%. The study results support the linearity of the claimed analytical
measuring interval (AMI): 1 – 300 U/mL.
Automatic dilution versus manual dilution
To verify the auto dilution function on IMMULITE 2000 analyzer, one high sample (> 300
U/mL) was diluted using the onboard dilution function and compared with dilution of the
same sample that was manually diluted by the same dilution factor. The high native serum
pool was diluted, using assay diluent 10x, 20x and 40x. The study was conducted on three
lots of modified reagent packs on one IMMULITE 2000 analyzer with five replicates run per
diluted sample. The dose by onboard dilution was compared to the dose obtained by manual
dilution and % bias calculated and compared to the acceptance criteria. The study results
support the automatic dilution function of IMMULITE 200 analyzer for the modified
IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA.
High Dose Hook Effect
The high-dose hook effect of the modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay was determined
by testing dilutions of a sample with a concentration of approximately 140,000 U/mL CA 15-
3. All samples were tested in duplicate using three modified reagent lots on one IMMULITE
2000 analyzer. The results showed no high dose hook effect up to 80,000 U/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity
The cross-reactivity of the modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay with Alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP), Cancer Antigen 125 (CA 125), Cancer Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and Carcinoembryonic
Antigen (CEA) was evaluated by testing two patient serum sample pools at low level
(between 4.7–5.6 U/mL) and one at a mid-level close to the cut-off (between 30–36 U/mL).
Each substance was spiked into test samples, and control samples were prepared by spiking
solvent into the samples. Samples were run in replicates of five using one modified reagent
lot on one IMMULITE 2000 Analyzer. The cross-reactivity was calculated by comparing
measurements of the test and control samples. No significant cross reactivity (≤ ±10%
difference of test from control) for the modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay was
observed up to the following concentrations of the potential cross-reacting substances tested:
Cross-reacting Substance Concentration
AFP 5,000 IU/mL
CA 125 10,000 U/mL
CA 19-9 2,000 U/mL
CEA 5,000 ng/mL
Interference
The interference of the modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay was performed following
recommendations of CLSI EP07, 3rd Edition.

Potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances were tested for their ability to
interfere with the modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay using two serum samples with
CA 15-3 concentration around 30 U/mL and 120 U/mL. For each interfering substance, test
samples were spiked with the test substance and results were compared to control samples
spiked with an equal volume of solvent. Samples were measured in three replicates except
for biotin samples which were run in five replicates. The study was performed using one
modified reagent lot run on one IMMULITE 2000 analyzer.
Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies (HAMA) interference was evaluated by testing two patient
serum samples at ~8 U/mL and ~34 U/mL. The samples were spiked with commercially
available HAMA serum. The spiked sample and the corresponding serum sample without
HAMA were tested in five replicates using one modified reagent lot on one IMMULITE
2000 analyzer.
The interference was calculated by comparing the mean measurements of the test and control
samples. No significant interference (≤ ±10% difference of test from control) were observed
for the modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay up to the following concentrations for each
endogenous and exogenous substances tested:

Traceability
The assay is traceable to an internal standard; no international reference standard is available
for CA 15-3 currently.
Stability
The stability of the modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay is evaluated according to the
recommendation of CLSI EP25-A.
Shelf-life (unopened): A study was performed to establish the real-time shelf-life stability of
the modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA. Three lots of modified reagents were stored in
product storage conditions (2–8°C). Lots were tested using three commercial control
samples, three standards, and three native pooled serum samples, each representing low, mid,
and high CA 15-3 concentrations in replicates of five at the following time-points 0, 1, 2, 31,
45, 60, 91, 179, 225, 301, and 325 days on one IMMULITE 2000 analyzer. The data of each
sample at each testing time point were compared to the data of initial value tested at baseline.
The data supports the reagent stability of 301 days at 2–8°C. The stability study is ongoing.
Open in-use stability: The modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay was evaluated for in-
use stability. One lot of reagent pack was opened, tested at time 0 and stored at 2–8°C. Three
commercial control samples, three standards, and three native pooled serum samples, each
representing low, mid, and high CA 15-3 concentrations, were tested in replicates of five at
time-points 0, 31, 38, 60, 66, 90, and 98 days on one IMMULITE 2000 analyzer. The data of
each sample at each testing time point were compared to the data of initial value tested at
baseline. The data supports the open reagent pack stability of the modified IMMULITE 2000
BR-MA up to 90 days stored at 2–8°C after initial use.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
established for modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay following the recommendations of
CLSI EP17-A2.
The LoB was determined from the measurement of four analyte-free serum samples tested in
five replicates per sample over three days using three modified reagent lots on one
IMMULITE 2000 analyzer (60 measurement replicates per lot). The LoB was calculated
using the classical non-parametric approach by establishing the 95% rank. The claimed LoB
is 0.21 U/mL which is the highest LoB value observed across three reagent lots.
The LoD was determined from the measurement of eight low-level serum samples in five
replicates, two runs per day over five days using three lots of modified reagents on one
IMMULITE 2000 analyzer (400 measurements, per lot). The LoD was calculated as the LoB
+ 1.645 x SD of the replicates for the low-level samples. The claimed LoD is 0.30 U/mL
which is the highest LoD value observed across lots.
The LoQ was determined based on the LoD study described above using the precision
profile. LoQ was defined as the level meet the %CV of the within-lab imprecision of 20%.
The claimed LoQ is 1 U/mL.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A total of 315 native serum samples were tested in singlicate over eight days using three lots
of the modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay and one lot of the predicate device
(K013984) on one IMMULITE 2000 analyzer. The samples included 144 samples from
patients with breast cancer, 50 samples from patients with non-breast cancer malignant
disease, 61 samples from patients with non-cancer diseases, 49 samples from healthy females
(24 pre-menopausal, 25 post-menopausal), and additional 11 contrived samples (pooled
breast cancer samples) to cover the upper end of the measuring range. Each contrived sample
was prepared by pooling two individual native breast cancer samples. Only the samples
(N=274) within the measuring ranges of both the modified device and the predicate were
analyzed by Passing-Bablok regression, and the results are summarized below:

2. Matrix Comparison:
Matrix comparison study was performed to demonstrate that serum separator tube (SST), and
lithium heparin plasma and EDTA plasma matrices yield comparable values as serum with
the modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay. The 40 matched sample sets covering the
analytical measuring interval (AMI) of the assay were tested in singleton using one modified
reagent lot on IMMULITE 2000 analyzer. Passing-Bablok regression analyses were
performed by comparing the results of samples from SST and different plasma samples (y) to
the results of corresponding serum samples (x). The results are summarized in the tables
below:

C Clinical Studies:
Clinical studies were conducted in K013984.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Clinical cut-offs were established in K013984.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
To verify if the reference range of the modified IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA assay is the same as
that established in K013984, a total of 69 samples (31 pre-menopausal and 38 post-menopausal
female) from apparently healthy female individuals were tested per recommendations in CLSI
EP28-A3c. The age cut-off of 50 years was used to define pre- and post-menopausal status of the
donor. The samples were from subjects representing four major ethnic groups (41 Caucasian, 13
Hispanics, 10 African American, and 5 Asian). The samples were run in single replicate on three
lots of each of the modified reagent kits and one reference lot of unmodified reagent lot on one
IMMULITE 2000 analyzer. The unmodified assay’s reference range found that ≥ 90% of normal
female samples fell within the range of the normal range described in K013984 as 6.4–58 U/mL.
In each of the three modified lots, 65 of the 69 samples (94%) fell within this range, supporting a
claim that there is no change of reference range established previously in K013984.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
