IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
This submission is for a range extension of a single antimicrobial cleared for use on BD Phoenix
ID/AST or AST only panels. The ID portion of the ID/AST combination panel was not subject to
review in this submission.
The Phoenix AST method is a broth-based microdilution test. The Phoenix panel is a sealed and
self-inoculating molded polystyrene tray with 136 micro-wells containing dried reagents. The
ID/AST combination panel includes an ID side (51 wells) with dried substrates for bacterial
identification and an AST side (85 wells). The AST panel contains a wide range of two-fold
doubling dilution concentrations of antimicrobial agents and growth and fluorescent controls at
appropriate well locations. The AST panel does not include wells for isolate identification.
The Phoenix System utilizes a redox indicator for the detection of organism growth in the
presence of an antimicrobial agent. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be
preliminarily identified as gram-positive or gram-negative. Colonies are then suspended in ID
broth and equated to a 0.5 McFarland suspension using a nephelometer device. A further dilution
is made into AST broth (a cation-adjusted formulation of Mueller-Hinton broth containing
0.010% Tween 80), to which the redox-buffered oxidation-reduction AST indicator solution is
added producing a blue color in the wells. The concentration of organisms in the final AST broth
suspension is approximately 5 X 105 CFU/mL.
The Phoenix AST Broth is poured into the inoculation port of the AST panel and the inoculum
flows into the panel, filling panel wells. Polyethylene caps are applied to seal the inoculation
ports. An air admittance port is located in the panel lid to ensure adequate oxygen tension in the
panel for the duration of the test. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD
K233986 - Page 3 of 13

--- Page 4 ---
Phoenix Automated Microbiology System instrument where panels are continuously incubated at
35 °C ± 1 °C.
Continuous measurements of changes to the indicator as well as bacterial turbidity are used in
the determination of bacterial growth. The instrument takes readings every 20 minutes.
Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobial agent reduce the indicator (changing
it to a pink color). This signals organism growth and resistance to that antimicrobial agent.
Organisms killed or inhibited by the antimicrobial agent do not cause reduction of the indicator
and therefore do not produce a color change. The Phoenix instrument reads and records the
results of the antimicrobial tests contained in the panel and interprets the reactions (based on the
organism identification) to give a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value and category
interpretations (susceptible, intermediate, resistant, or not susceptible). AST results are available
within 16 hours. This is an auto read result; no manual readings are possible with this system.
Additional comments concerning specific organism/antimicrobial combinations are provided
from the software-driven expert system (BDXpert), using rules derived from CLSI
documentation and/or the FDA-approved drug labeling.
B Principle of Operation:
The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System is a broth-based microdilution method that
utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection of organism
growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing serial two-fold
dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” that contain no antibiotic.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System - GN Ciprofloxacin
(0.0156-4 µg/mL) was conducted at three clinical sites using a panel of 12 Salmonella
isolates with on-scale MICs. The isolates were tested at each site in triplicate over three
different days using both inoculation methods (manual and BD Phoenix AP) resulting in 324
data points (12 strains x 3 replicates x 3 sites x 3 days = 324) for each inoculation method.
The isolates tested in the reproducibility study included Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica
serovar Paratyphi A (1), and Salmonella species (11). The reproducibility was calculated

based on MIC values falling within ±1 dilution of the mode value for each isolate. As all
results were on-scale, there was no calculation of worst-case scenario results. Quality control
performed during performance of the reproducibility study was determined to be acceptable.
The results of the study demonstrate that for ciprofloxacin with Salmonella spp., there was an
overall reproducibility across test sites of greater than 95% (± 1 dilution) agreement when
compared to the test mode; results were determined to be acceptable. (Table 1)

As there is no change in the reporting range when testing Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa
with the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System – GN Ciprofloxacin (0.25-4 µg/mL),
reproducibility data remains the same as was previously evaluated during review of K060217
and was determined to be acceptable (refer to the K060217 Decision
Summary).

Grey shaded rows indicate the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System - GN Ciprofloxacin (0.25-4
µg/mL) expected range.
*The lower end range extension only applies to the Salmonella species. Therefore, the BD Phoenix instrument
will not report an MIC below 0.25 μg/mL for E. coli or P. aeruginosa. Obtaining a value of ≤0.25 µg/mL for E.
coli ATCC 25922 was considered an indicator that the quality control test results were acceptable. The expected
range for E. coli remains ≤0.25 μg/mL and P. aeruginosa remains ≤0.25-1 μg/mL (refer to the K060217
Decision Summary).
Inoculum Density Check: The BD PhoenixSpec Nephelometer (primary inoculation
method) was used to prepare the inocula for testing of the clinical, challenge, reproducibility,
and QC isolates. The same inoculum suspension was used for both the Phoenix System and
the reference method testing. The ability of the BD Phoenix AP instrument to prepare an
appropriate inoculum was evaluated with challenge, QC, and reproducibility isolates.
Validation data for both the PhoenixSpec and the Phoenix AP instrument was provided and
found to be acceptable.
Growth Failure Rate: The growth failure rate for both inoculum preparation methods was
0%.
Purity Check: Purity check plates were prepared for all isolates from each inoculation
preparation method. Results were only included for pure cultures.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Ciprofloxacin (0.0156 - 4 μg/mL)
Results obtained with the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System – GN Ciprofloxacin
(0.0156 - 4 μg/mL) panel were compared to results obtained with the CLSI frozen broth
microdilution reference panel. Reference panels were prepared according to CLSI M07
guidelines. The range of dilutions evaluated with the reference panels was the same as that
used for the BD Ciprofloxacin panel (0.0156 – 4 µg/mL).
Medium: BD Phoenix AST Broth – a cation-adjusted formulation of Mueller Hinton broth
used in conjunction with the AST Indicator Solution, a redox indicator.
Inoculum: The BD Phoenix Spec Nephelometer, the primary inoculation method, was used
to obtain a suspension approximating a 0.50 – 0.60 McFarland standard for all challenge and
clinical isolates.
Incubation: 35° C ± 1° C
Clinical testing was conducted at three U.S. sites using 47 Salmonella isolates (7
contemporary [14.9%] and 40 stock [85.1%]) isolates. The low number of contemporary
isolates tested was considered acceptable due to the prevalence of Salmonella spp. Strains
tested included: Salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae (2 isolates), Salmonella enterica spp.
enterica serovar Cholerasuis (3 isolates), Salmonella enterica spp. enterica serovar Typhi (4
isolates) and Salmonella spp. (38 isolates).
A total of 82 challenge isolates were evaluated at 3 sites. Strains tested included Salmonella
enterica spp. enterica serovar Paratyphi A (9 isolates), Salmonella enterica spp. enterica
serovar Typhi (3 isolates) and Salmonella spp. (70 isolates).
Results obtained for tests inoculated manually were acceptable.

Eval – Evaluable isolates vmj - very major errors
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the MIC result of the reference method and that
of the BD Phoenix within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that
are on scale for both the BD Phoenix and the reference method or those in which an off-scale result is at least two
doubling dilutions from the on-scale result. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of
the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the BD Phoenix.
The BD Phoenix AP instrument, the secondary inoculation method, was evaluated using
challenge, QC, and reproducibility isolates. The BD Phoenix AP instrument is designed to
standardize the ID broth inoculum equivalent to the BD Phoenix Spec Nephelometer.
Following suspension standardization, the instrument adds the preset amount of AST
indicator broth to the AST broth tube and transfers the required aliquot of ID broth inoculum
to AST broth tubes. Results obtained for tests inoculated using the BD Phoenix AP
instrument were acceptable.

Acinetobacter spp. and other Non-Enterobacterales, the indications for use has been revised
and limited to P. aeruginosa and specific Enterobacterales species, as noted on the FDA drug
label for ciprofloxacin.
Since no changes were made to the design or dilution range for testing species other than for
testing Salmonella, the performance of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System -
GN Ciprofloxacin (0.25-4 µg/mL) with Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa using revised
interpretive criteria currently recognized by the FDA, the sponsor provided their reanalysis of
the original data to confirm that performance continues to be met in accordance with the AST
Special Controls Guidance.
The combined clinical and challenge data for 2836 isolates (tested with the manual
inoculation method) were re-analyzed with the updated breakpoints. This re-analysis
included 2,169 Enterobacterales (2,085 clinical isolates and 84 challenge isolates) and 532 P.
aeruginosa (524 clinical isolates and 8 challenge isolates). In addition, results from 152 non-
indicated species (147 clinical isolates and 5 challenge isolates, representing <10% of the
total number of isolates tested) were also re-analyzed. The performance data included in the
device labeling included combined performance for Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa and non-
indicated species. To provide clarity on the performance provided in the device labeling, the
following was included in a footnote to the performance table:
Enterobacterales (2169), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (532) and non-indicated species
(152) were included in the above combined performance.
When applying the new breakpoints, the CA for Enterobacterales was >90% and considered
acceptable. Reanalyzed results for P. aeruginosa breakpoints, showed a CA of 88.7% due
mainly to an increased percentage of minor errors. The EA of evaluable results was 85.3%.
To address the unacceptable CA, the following limitation was added to the device labeling:
Due to the occurrence of a high number of minor errors, isolates of P. aeruginosa that
provide MICs of 1 µg/mL should be retested with an alternate method.
Trending
A trending analysis was conducted using the combined data (clinical and challenge) obtained
from the manual inoculation method. This trending calculation takes into account MIC
values that are determined to be one or more doubling dilutions lower or higher than the
reference method irrespective of whether the device MIC values are on-scale or not. Results
that are not clearly at least one dilution lower, at least one dilution higher or in exact
agreement with the CLSI reference method are not considered in the trending analysis.
Organism groups or species for which the difference between the percentage of isolates with
higher vs. lower readings was > 30% and for which the confidence interval was determined
to be statistically significant were considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that
showed higher or lower MIC values compared to the reference is addressed in the labeling.
Results for Salmonella spp. showed high trending for Salmonella enterica spp. arizonae,
Salmonella enterica spp. enterica serovar Cholerasuis and Salmonella enterica spp. enterica

As required under 511A(2)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the following
statement is added to the Precautions section of the device labeling:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety and efficacy
of antimicrobial drugs for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by this AST device, may or
may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials for treating clinical
infections due to microorganisms outside of those found in the indications and usage in the drug
label. The clinical significance of susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The
approved labelling for specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial
drug is approved.

VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission included a predetermined change control plan (PCCP)
that was reviewed and accepted by FDA, as described in the Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) System Devices – Updating Breakpoints in Device Labeling guidance. This PCCP
addresses future revisions to device labeling in response to breakpoint changes that are
recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/ucm410971.
htm). The PCCP outlined the specific procedures and acceptance criteria that Becton, Dickinson
and Company intends to use to evaluate the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System - GN
Ciprofloxacin when revised breakpoints for ciprofloxacin are published on the FDA STIC
webpage. The PCCP included with the submission indicated that if specific criteria are met,
Becton, Dickinson and Company will update the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System -
GN Ciprofloxacin device label to include (1) the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance
section after re-evaluation of data in this premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and
(3) any new limitations as determined by their evaluation.
