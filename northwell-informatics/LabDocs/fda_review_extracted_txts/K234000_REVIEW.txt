Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates)
The VITEK 2 Gram-positive Susceptibility Card is intended for use with the VITEK 2 Systems
in clinical laboratories as an in vitro test to determine the susceptibility of Staphylococcus spp.,
Enterococcus spp., and S. agalactiae to antimicrobial agents when used as instructed.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining any results other than "Susceptible."
Isolates yielding MIC results other than “Susceptible” should be submitted to a reference
laboratory for further testing.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact systems using VITEK 2 Systems v9.02 software or newer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the doubling
dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2
AST card contains 64 wells. A control well which only contains microbiological culture media
is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of antimicrobials
combined with nutrient media. The isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration
with 0.45% to 0.50% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the
card. The VITEK 2 System will automatically (or allow operator to manually) dilute the bacterial

suspension to prepare an inoculum for susceptibility cards. Then, the VITEK 2 will fill, seal and
place the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing, and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. The analysis program determines when a well demonstrates growth based
on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. This data is used to determine the
minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC” values for the antimicrobial agent. At the
completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with
the interpretive category result for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
.
VITEK 2 AST-GP Lefamulin has the following concentrations in the card: ≤0.125, 0.5, 1, 2
(equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The MIC result range indicates
that the VITEK 2 system can produce and report the following MIC results: ≤0.03, 0.06, 0.125, 0.25,
0.5, 1, 2, ≥4 μg/mL for the VITEK 2 AST-GP Lefamulin test.
B Principle of Operation:
The VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems utilize automated growth-based detection using
attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. The optics in the systems use visible light to
directly measure organism growth within each of the 64 micro-wells. Transmittance optics is
based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun. Every 15 minutes
throughout the incubation cycle (defined period of time based on the VITEK 2 card), light
transmittance readings of each well determine organism growth by the amount of light that is
prevented from passing through the well. At the completion of the incubation period, the MIC
values and their associated interpretive category results for each antimicrobial on the test card are
displayed in an automatically generated report.

Reproducibility testing for the VITEK 2 AST- Gram Positive Lefamulin was conducted at
three external sites using a panel of ten methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains
consistent with the indications for use. Each isolate was tested in triplicate, using separate
inocula, over three days for a total of 270 data points. The inocula were prepared using both the
auto-dilution and manual dilution methods for testing with the VITEK 2 System. In addition,
inocula were prepared by the manual dilution method for testing with the VITEK 2 Compact.
The mode of MIC values was determined for each isolate and the reproducibility was calculated
based on the number of MIC values that fell within ± one doubling dilution of the mode MIC
value. The majority of data points were on-scale and within ± one doubling dilution agreement as
compared to the mode MIC. The data was analyzed taking into consideration best-case and
worst-case scenarios as described in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. The reproducibility performance is shown
in Table 1. The results are acceptable.

The CLSI recommended QC strain, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 was tested a
sufficient number of times (i.e., at least 20/site) at each testing site using both the VITEK 2
AST-GP Lefamulin and Broth Microdilution (BMD) reference method. Both the automatic
dilution and manual dilution methods were used for the VITEK 2 and the manual dilution
method was used for the VITEK 2 Compact. The results are summarized in Table 2 below.
Both the auto dilution and manual dilution methods for VITEK 2 and the manual dilution
method for VITEK 2 Compact QC results were within the expected range >95% of the time.
Although trending toward lower MIC values was observed, QC was determined to be
acceptable.

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Testing of Lefamulin on the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive card was performed at three
external sites. There were 329 clinical isolates and 75 challenge isolates tested for a total of
404 isolates tested. Results obtained with VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Lefamulin were
compared to results obtained with the CLSI broth microdilution (BMD) reference method.
The MIC range for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Lefamulin is ≤ 0.03 - ≥ 4 µg/mL for all
species. The reference method testing consisted of two-fold serial dilutions of Lefamulin
with a range of ≤0.015 to ≥ 32 μg/mL. The testing conditions for the reference method
consisted of the following:
• Medium: Mueller Hinton broth with the appropriate dilutions of antimicrobial
solution added
• Inoculum: Direct colony suspension
• Incubation: 35 ± 2 °C; 16-20 hours
The VITEK 2 AST cards were inoculated with test organisms using the auto-dilution method
(VITEK 2) and using the manual dilution method (VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact). All test
inocula used for the VITEK 2 AST cards and the reference method were standardized using
the DensiCheck Plus instrument.
During the Comparison Studies, it was noted that when tested with methicillin-susceptible
Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Lefamulin required prolonged incubation times to generate
MIC values. The following footnote is included in the device labeling to address the
extended incubation time:
The incubation time (Time of Call) for AST GP cards containing Lefamulin may exceed
16 hours. This extended incubation time is required to generate MIC values.
A total of 329 clinical isolates of MSSA were evaluated using the auto-dilution and VITEK
2. Of these isolates, 100% were recent isolates (isolated within the last 6 months). No clinical
stock isolates were tested.
A total of 75 challenge isolates of MSSA were evaluated. This challenge set was tested with
the auto-dilution and manual dilution options of the VITEK 2 and with the manual dilution
method on the VITEK 2 Compact.
Clinical and Challenge Data-VITEK 2 Auto-Dilution
The results obtained using the auto-dilution method of the VITEK 2 from the 404 total
isolates (329 clinical isolates and 75 challenge isolates) are summarized in Table 3.

	that of the VITEK 2 test card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results
	are those that are on scale for both the VITEK 2 test card and the reference method or those in which an off scale
	result is at least two doubling dilutions from the on scale result. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the
	interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK 2 test
	card.

The overall performance for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Lefamulin when testing
MSSA with the manual dilution option of the VITEK 2 system is acceptable with an EA of
94.7%, a CA of 100%, and no category errors (0%).
The overall performance for the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Lefamulin when testing
MSSA with the VITEK 2 Compact system is acceptable with an EA of 96.0%, a CA of
100%, and no category errors (0%).
As required under 511A(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the
following statement is included in the Precautions section of the device labeling to address
testing and reporting of non-indicated species:
Per the FDA-Recognized Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria website, the safety
and efficacy of antimicrobial drugs, for which antimicrobial susceptibility is tested by
this AST device, may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled
clinical trials for treating clinical infections due to microorganisms outside of those
found in the indications and usage in the drug label. The clinical significance of
susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved labeling for
specific antimicrobial drugs provides the uses for which the antimicrobial drug is
approved.
Trending
A trending analysis was performed using both the clinical and challenge data. This trending
calculation analyzes device MIC values that are determined to be one or more doubling
dilutions lower or higher than the reference method. MIC values that are off-scale for both
the reference and device are not considered in the trending analysis. Organisms in which the
difference between the percentage of isolates with higher vs. lower MIC values was ≥ 30%
and for which the confidence interval was determined to be statistically significant were
considered to show evidence of trending. Trending that shows higher or lower MIC values
compared to the reference is addressed in the labeling.
The VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Lefamulin MIC values for MSSA tended to be equal to or
at least one doubling dilution lower than the reference broth microdilution method, as seen in
Table 5. The following footnote was added to the performance table in the device labeling to
address trending:
VITEK 2 Lefamulin MIC values tended to be in exact agreement or at least one doubling
dilution lower when testing methicillin-susceptible S. aureus compared to the CLSI
reference broth microdilution method.

aFDA STIC Website
The current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining any results other than "Susceptible". Isolates
yielding MIC results other than “Susceptible” should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further
testing.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.

IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
To support the implementation of changes to FDA-recognized susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (i.e., breakpoints), this submission incorporated by reference a breakpoint change
protocol that was reviewed and accepted by the FDA in submission K230864 cleared on July 5,
2023. The referenced protocol addresses future revisions to device labeling in response to
breakpoint changes that are recognized on the FDA STIC webpage
(https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-resources/fda-recognized-antimicrobial-susceptibility-
test-interpretive-criteria). The referenced protocol outlined the specific procedures and
acceptance criteria that bioMérieux intends to use to evaluate the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive
Lefamulin when revised breakpoints for Lefamulin are published on the FDA STIC webpage.
The breakpoint change protocol included with the submission indicated that if specific criteria
are met, bioMérieux will update the VITEK 2 AST-Gram Positive Lefamulin label to include (1)
the new breakpoints, (2) an updated performance section after re-evaluation of data in this
premarket notification with the new breakpoints, and (3) any new limitations as determined by
their evaluation.
