III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access CK-MB assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of CK-MB levels in human serum and plasma using the Access
Immunoassay Systems to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction and muscle
diseases such as progressive, Duchenne-type muscular dystrophy.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (K221225)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Access CK-MB assay consists of the following reagents:
• R1a: Paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-biotin antibodies and biotinylated anti-
human CK-BB mouse monoclonal antibodies suspended in buffered solution, with bovine
serum albumin (BSA), 0.2% ProClin* 950, and < 0.1% sodium azide.
• R1b: Purified mouse IgG and purified goat IgG in buffered solution with BSA, 0.1% ProClin
300, and < 0.1% sodium azide.
• R1c: Mouse monoclonal anti-human CK-MB antibody alkaline phosphatase conjugate in
buffered solution with BSA, 0.1% ProClin 300, and < 0.1% sodium azide.
Other items needed to run the assay include the Access CK-MB Calibrators, along with the
UniCel DxI wash buffer II and Lumi-Phos PRO substrate. It is intended for use on the DxI 9000
Access Immunoassay Analyzer in a clinical laboratory setting.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access CK-MB assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay.
Patient sample is added to a reaction vessel with mouse monoclonal anti-human CK-MB
antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and paramagnetic particles coated with mouse
monoclonal anti-human CK-BB. Human serum CK-MB binds to the anti-CK-MB conjugate and
is immobilized on the paramagnetic particle coated with anti-CK-BB. The CK-MB in the human
serum or plasma binds to the immobilized anti-CK-BB on the solid phase by the sub-unit B
epitope (common to CK-BB and CK-MB isoforms), while the mouse anti-CK-MB conjugate
reacts specifically with the serum or the plasma CK-MB (no reaction with CK-MM or CK-BB
isoforms).
K234005 - Page 2 of 7

--- Page 3 ---
After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light
generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly
proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically
determined from a stored calibration.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to CLSI EP05-A3. The study was run on three DxI 9000
Access Immunoassay Analyzers using three reagent lots and three calibrator lots. Five
lithium heparin plasma samples, with varying CK-MB concentrations, were tested in
replicates of two with two runs per day, over 20 days, for a total of 80 replicates per sample
on each instrument and reagent lot combination. One commercial quality control sample was
run in duplicate on each day.

2. Linearity:
A study was performed to determine the linearity of the candidate device based on the
recommendations in the CLSI EP06-2nd Edition guideline. Eight or nine lithium heparin
samples ranging from 0.03 ng/mL (native) to 378.06 ng/mL were prepared by mixing a high
sample spiked with CK-MB antigen and a native sample with a low concentration. The low
sample was run in replicates of eight, and all other samples were run in replicates of three or
four. The study was run using three reagent lots and three calibrator lots. The results were
analyzed using a weighted linear regression model and the deviation from linearity did not
exceed 5%. The data support that the assay is linear over the claimed measuring range of 0.2
ng/mL to 300 ng/mL CK-MB.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference was reviewed in K030012 and the claims are unchanged. The sponsor provided
information to support that biotin up to 3500 ng/mL does not interfere with the test. The
following statement is included in the labeling. “Biotin was added to samples containing
approximately 0.75 ng/mL (µg/L) and 5.0 ng/mL (µg/L) of CK-MB. CK-MB values obtained
in the presence of biotin up to 3500 ng/mL were within ± 10% of the controls.”
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The claimed assay reportable range is 0.2 ng/mL - 300 ng/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The traceability of the Access CK-MB assay is unchanged since the clearance in K030012.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
determined for the Access CK-MB assay based upon recommendations in the CLSI EP17-A2
guideline. The LoB was determined to be 0.01 ng/mL. The LoD was determined to be 0.02
ng/mL. The LoQ was determined to be 0.03 ng/mL based on a 20% CV performance goal.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A method comparison study was conducted using a protocol based on CLSI EP09c, 3rd
Edition. A total of 146 lithium heparin plasma samples were evaluated, of which 132 were
native samples and 14 were native samples supplemented with CK-MB antigen.
The study was run using three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers and three Access 2
instruments with three reagent lots and three calibrator lots. The concentrations in the
K234005 - Page 5 of 7

samples ranged from 0.29-271 ng/mL, as determined by the comparator device. Each sample
was run in singleton. Weighted Deming regression analysis was performed. The regression
