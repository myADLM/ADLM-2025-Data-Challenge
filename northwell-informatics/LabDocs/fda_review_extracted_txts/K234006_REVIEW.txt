B Indication(s) for Use:
AllSource Drug Detector FenTest is competitive binding, lateral flow immunochromatographic
assay for qualitative detection of Fentanyl in human urine at the cutoff concentrations of 1
ng/mL.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must
be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred
confirmatory method.
For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The AllSource Drug Detector Fentanyl Test is a rapid, one-step immunoassay for the qualitative
detection of fentanyl in human urine at the cutoff concentrations of 1 ng/mL.
This device provides only preliminary drug test results. To obtain a quantitative result or a
confirmation of a presumptive positive result, a more specific alternative method must be used.
GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method.
Professional judgment should be applied to drug test results, particularly when preliminary
positive results are indicated.
It is for in vitro diagnostic use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC – Over The Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
AllSource Drug Detector Fentanyl Test is an immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection
of fentanyl in human urine. Each AllSource Drug Detector Fentanyl Test device consists of a
Test Dip Card and a package insert. Each Test Dip Card is sealed with sachets of desiccant in an
aluminum pouch.
B Principle of Operation:
AllSource Drug Detector Fentanyl Test is a competitive and immunochromatography assay, and
uses monoclonal antibody as the indicator marker to qualitatively detect fentanyl in human urine.
The test cassette contains fentanyl test strip. The nitrocellulose membrane test area (T) of the test
strip is correspondingly coated with fentanyl-bovine serum albumin conjugate, and the quality
control area (C) is coated with goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody. When the concentration
K234006 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
of fentanyl in the sample is higher than or equal to the cut-off of the product, it will compete with
the corresponding conjugate coated on the test area (T) to bind to the monoclonal antibody, the
test line is inhibited and the result is positive; while when the sample does not contain fentanyl or
its concentration is lower than the cut-off of the product, the corresponding conjugate on the test
line reacts with sufficient monoclonal antibodies; the test line will be visible and the result is
negative. If there is no control line, it is an invalid result.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out in three sites for samples with concentrations of +100%
cutoff, +75% cutoff, +50% cutoff, +25% cutoff, cutoff, -25% cutoff, -50% cutoff, -75% cut
off and -100% cutoff. These samples were prepared by spiked target drug in drug-free urine
samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. All sample aliquots were
blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples but didn’t take part in the sample
testing. For each concentration, tests were performed two tests per day for 10 days per device
lot in a randomized order by three operators.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-Reactivity:
To test cross-reactivity, drug metabolites and other structurally related compounds that are
likely to cross-react in urine samples were spiked into negative urine and were tested using
three device lots. The lowest concentration that caused a positive result for each compound is
listed below (if no cross reactivity was observed the highest concentration tested is shown):

Effect of Urinary Specific Gravity and pH:
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples, with specific
gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.035 or urine samples with pH ranging from 4 to 9 were
spiked with the target drugs to concentrations at 50% below and 50% above Cutoff levels.
These samples were tested using three lots of device. The results demonstrated that pH levels
of 4 to 9 and specific gravity levels of 1.000 to 1.035 do not affect the results of the assays.

2. Lay user study:
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 140 lay persons. They had
diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 18 to >50 years.
Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations: -100%, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-
25% of the cut-off by spiking fentanyl into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The
concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into
individual containers, blind-labeled and randomized. Each participant was provided with the
package insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. The results are summarized below:
