IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITEK COMPACT PRO is intended for laboratory use by professional users who are
trained in microbiology and good laboratory practices. The VITEK COMPACT PRO instrument
is an automated instrument designed for use in both clinical and industry laboratories. The
instrument performs sample well filling, incubation, and optical readings. The VITEK
COMPACT PRO instrument is a two-step automated instrument for:
• Hydrating reagents with sample inoculum prepared from isolated colonies
• Pre-processing cards, incubating cards, and continuous reading for growth
The VITEK 2 Systems Software receives the instrument optical readings and performs analysis
to report the ID/AST results. The instrument then ejects the used reagent card into the waste area
for disposal. The system includes a VITEK COMPACT PRO instrument with an internal
computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse, handheld barcode scanner, and USB hub. The software
provided with the internal computer includes analysis and limited data management programs. A
bidirectional computer interface (BCI) may transfer results automatically to the user’s laboratory
information system (LIS). A Quality Control System is available to track the quality control
results of the test cards. The Advanced Expert System (AES, Clinical Use) is available to
provide online, systematic validation of results and interpretation of resistant phenotypes found
during susceptibility testing.
The VITEK COMPACT PRO is intended for organism identification and AST results
(quantitative MIC values). Then, VITEK2 Systems softwares (e.g., LIS and AES) use the
organism ID and antimicrobial agent MIC values to determine the qualitative categorical
interpretation based on the best phenotype match.

B Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
VITEK COMPACT PRO
2. Specimen Identification:
Patient information may be entered manually or downloaded from a data management
system. The instrument reads the bar code information from the cards and cassettes and
automatically sends the information to the system software.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Isolated colonies are inoculated into saline and then the density was manually adjusted to a
0.5 McFarland standard using a VITEK 2 DENSICHECK. Specimens and a cassette are
loaded into the instrument for the autoinoculation into test cards. Then, the cassette in
manually transferred into the load/unload station for incubation.
4. Calibration:
Self-calibrating.
5. Quality Control:
Quality Control (QC) testing of the VITEK COMPACT PRO should be performed as
dictated by the protocol in the package insert of each AST card and antimicrobial agent. The
purpose of QC testing is to monitor performance of the VITEK COMPACT PRO as well as
the proficiency of the laboratory personnel who use the system. The QC testing is performed
with the manufacturer recommended QC strains. The QC workflow follows the same steps as
the sample workflow. The QC results are generated and displayed on the user interface
indicating the expected QC MIC range, the VITEK COMPACT PRO AST interpretive
criteria call, and whether the relevant antimicrobial agents for the organism have passed or
failed.
During validation testing of each AST card, indicated antimicrobial agents and CLSI-
recommended reference strains are summarized in Table 1. Purity of all the isoaltes was
confirmed by purity plates, with 100% of purity plates showing monomicrobial growth.
Results are summarized in Table 2 and the quality control testing is acceptable.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of MIC results was evaluated with VITEK COMPACT PRO. For this
study, three instruments were used at three testing sites. The following VITEK AST test card
panels were used during testing: Gram-Negative (GN), Gram-Positive (GP), Streptococcus
(ST) and Yeast (YS). All GN, GP and ST reproducibility isolates were sub-cultured twice
onto trypticase soy agar and incubated appropriately at 35 ± 2 ºC, for 18 – 24 hours (GN and
GP) or 18 – 20 hours (ST) before testing. All yeast isolates were sub-cultured twice onto
Sabouraud dextrose agar and incubated at 35 ± 2 ºC for 24 hours. Each reproducibility isolate
was tested on the VITEK COMPACT PRO using the manual dilution method. The
reproducibility set was tested in triplicate for three days at three clinical trial sites per
instrument producing at least 54 results per antimicrobial (2 organisms × 3 replicates × 3
sites × 3 days = 54). For all antimicrobials evaluated, best-case and worst-case
reproducibility was ≥95%. Additionally, purity plates were analyzed for monomicrobial
growth. All purity plates displayed monomicrobial growth. The list of organism groups and
antimicrobial agents tested in the reproducibility study is shown in Table 4. Results are
summarized in Table 5 stratified by each AST card. The cumulative reporting and
stratification by each card is presented for simplicity and was based on the analysis for each
drug/organism combination which revealed acceptable reproducibility results.

4. Accuracy (Instrument):
The accuracy of MICs obtained by the VITEK COMPACT Pro was evaluated testing
representative strains of clinically relevant microorganisms with the VITEK AST cards. The
test cards were categorized as each product class of gram-negative (GN), gram-positive (GP),
Streptococcus (ST) and yeast (YS) with the list of indicated organisms per antimicrobial. All
GN, GP and ST challenge isolates were sub-cultured twice onto trypticase soy agar and
incubated appropriately at 35 ± 2 ºC, for 18 – 24 hours (GN and GP) or 18 – 20 hours (ST)
before testing. All yeast isolates were sub-cultured twice onto Sabouraud dextrose agar and
incubated at 35 ± 2 ºC for 24 hours. Three different VITEK COMPACT PRO and VITEK 2 60
instruments operated by three different operators were used to test isolated colonies of
representative isolates of different species of Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and Candida spp..

The MIC results obtained using the VITEK COMPACT PRO were compared to the MIC
results obtained using the VITEK 2. Essential Agreement (EA) was defined as MIC results
obtained from the VITEK COMPACT PRO that were within one doubling dilution of the
MIC results obtained from the VITEK 2. Category Agreement (CA) was defined as MIC
interpretations (S/SDD/I/R) that were the same between the VITEK COMPACT PRO and
VITEK 2. Very major errors were defined as false susceptible results from the VITEK
COMPACT PRO, major errors were defined as false resistance results from the VITEK
COMPACT PRO, and minor errors were defined as results with minor discrepancies (i.e., an
intermediate result reported as either resistant or susceptible, or vice versa). Since this is a
method-to-method comparison, results were considered acceptable if the EA was ≥95%.
Overall performance of AST card results was >95% for GN AST card (n=625 including
screening results), GP AST card (n=554 including screening results), ST AST card (n=437
including screening results), and YS AST card (n=89 results), which is acceptable.
For all species and antimicrobial agents in GN AST card, 576/583 (98.8%) of MIC results
were within one doubling dilution of the comparator result and 567/576 (97.3%) of SIR
categorizations were in agreement. For each microorganism and antimicrobial agent,
essential agreement was >95% except ceftriaxone (91.3% EA). One very major error (false
susceptible) occurred with Cefepime. One major error (false resistance) occurred with
Meropenem/vaborbactam and Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole each. All purity plates (100%)
exhibited monomicrobial growth.
For all species and antimicrobial agents in GP AST card, 427/429 (99.5%) of MIC results
were within one doubling dilution of the comparator result and 418/429 (97.4%) of SIR
categorizations were in agreement. For each microorganism and antimicrobial agent,
essential agreement was >95%. Two very major errors (false susceptible) occurred with
Daptomycin. Two major errors (false resistance) occurred with Ampicillin. All purity plates
(100%) exhibited monomicrobial growth.
For all species and antimicrobial agents in ST AST card, 387/393 (98.5%) of MIC results
were within one doubling dilution of the comparator result and 388/393 (98.7%) of SIR

categorizations were in agreement. For each microorganism and antimicrobial agent,
essential agreement was >95%. One very major error (false susceptible) occurred with
Cetriaxone, Clindamycin, and Tetracycline. One major error (false resistance) occurred with
Tetracycline. All purity plates (100%) exhibited monomicrobial growth.
For all species and antimicrobial agents in YS AST card, 89/89 (100%) of MIC results were
within one doubling dilution of the comparator result and 89/89 (100%) of SIR
categorizations were in agreement. For each microorganism and antimicrobial agent,
essential agreement was >95%. No very major error (false susceptible) and major error (false

Given a large volume of data, Table 7 summarizes the results stratified by AST card only.
The cumulative reporting and stratification by each AST card is presented for simplicity and
was based on the analysis for each drug/organism combination which revealed acceptable
high degree of agreement between VITEK COMPACT PRO and VITEK 2 instruments.
