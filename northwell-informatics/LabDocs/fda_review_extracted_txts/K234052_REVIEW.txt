A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access Ferritin assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of ferritin levels in human serum and plasma (heparin) using the
Access Immunoassay Systems.
Ferritin is used as an aid in the diagnosis of iron deficiency or iron overload.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (K221225).
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Access Ferritin assay kit contains two Access Ferritin Reagent Pack. Each Access Ferritin
Reagent Pack contains the following:
• Paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti mouse IgG: mouse monoclonal anti-ferritin
complexes suspended in TRIS buffered saline, with surfactant, bovine serum albumin
(BSA), < 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.1% ProClin 300.
• Goat anti-ferritin-alkaline phosphatase (bovine) conjugate in TRIS buffered saline, with
surfactant, BSA, protein (goat, mouse), < 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.1% ProClin 300.
Other items needed but not supplied with reagent kit include:
• Access Ferritin Calibrators: at zero and approximately 10, 50, 200, 500 and 1,500 ng/mL
• Quality Control (QC) materials: commercial control material.
• Substrate: Lumi-Phos PRO
• UniCel DxI Wash Buffer II
• Access Sample Diluent A (optional)
The modification of the Access Ferritin includes: (a) a new substrate replacement (Lumi-Phos
PRO); (b) run on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer
B Principle of Operation:
The Access Ferritin assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A sample is added
to a reaction vessel with goat anti-ferritin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and paramagnetic
K234052 - Page 2 of 8

--- Page 3 ---
particles coated with goat anti-mouse: mouse anti-ferritin complexes. Serum or plasma (heparin)
ferritin binds to the immobilized monoclonal anti-ferritin on the solid phase, while the goat anti-
ferritin enzyme conjugate reacts with different antigenic sites on the ferritin molecules. After
incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light
generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly
proportional to the concentration of analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically
determined from a stored calibration.

a) Within-Laboratory Precision:
The studies were performed by testing six levels of human serum samples in a minimum
of two replicates per run, two runs per day for 20 days, resulting a minimum of 80
datapoints for each sample. Three reagent lots and three instruments were used in the
study. The data were analyzed for repeatability (within-run), between-run, between-day,
and within-laboratory precision. The mean (ng/mL), standard deviation (SD) (ng/mL) and
percent coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated for each sample. The
representative data of within-laboratory precision using one lot of reagents on one
instrument are summarized in table below.

DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. Five serum samples at different concentrations
were tested in five replicates per run, one run per day over five days, resulting N=75
datapoints per sample on one instrument. The same study was also performed on two

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the modified Access Ferritin on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer
was performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP06, 2nd Edition. Dilution series were
prepared by mixing one High sample with a Low sample to provide eight dilution levels,
spanning the analytical measuring interval (AMI) of the modified Access Ferritin. The Low
sample was obtained from an individual native sample that was specifically depleted of
ferritin to achieve a concentration below the lower limit of the AMI. The High sample is a
pooled native sample at 1699 ng/mL. The low sample was run in replicates of eight, and all
other dilution levels were run in replicates of four, and the mean (ng/mL) of each dilution
level was compared to its predicted value for deviation percentage using a weighted linear
regression analysis. This deviation was then compared to the allowable deviation from
linearity. The results are summarized in table below.
Range Slope Intercept % Deviation*
R2
(ng/mL) (95% CI) (95% CI) (Deviation**)
1.005 -0.0002 -7% − 5%

* % Deviation from Linearity for concentrations > 0.6 ng/mL
** Deviation (ng/mL) from Linearity for concentrations ≤ 0.6 ng/mL
The data support the linearity interval from 0.03 to 1658.57 ng/mL with the deviations from
linearity within ±10%. The study results support the linearity of the claimed analytical
measuring interval (AMI): 0.6 – 1500 ng/mL.

Refer to K926221. The Access Ferritin is traceable to the WHO reference material
94/572.
b) Stability:
The Access Ferritin Reagent kit and the Lumi-Phos PRO substrate are packaged
separately. The stability of the Access Ferritin Reagent kit was established in K926221.
The proposed change is to replace substrate (Lumi-Phos 530) of the Access Ferritin with
a new substrate (Lumi-Phos PRO). The shelf-life claims and on-board stability claims of
Lumi-Phos PRO substrate were established in K221225.
6. Detection Limit:
CLSI guideline EP17-A2 was followed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of
Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the Access Ferritin.
LoB: The study was conducted on two DxI 9000 Immunoassay Systems with two Access
Ferritin reagent lots and one calibrator lot. Five analyte depleted samples (prepared from five
unique native serum samples) were tested over three days, with one run per day and five
replicates per run, resulting in 75 datapoints for each reagent lot and each instrument. The
LoB was determined as 0.2 ng/mL and 0.1 ng/mL based on the 95% nonparametric percentile
of the replicates for each of the two reagent lots. The claimed LoB for the modified Access
Ferritin on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.2 ng/mL.
LoD: For the determination of the LoD, three DxI 9000 Immunoassay Systems with three
reagent lots were used to test five to nine serum samples containing low levels of ferritin.
Samples were tested for five days with one run per day and nine replicates per run. LoD was
calculated from LoB + “SD multiplied by the 95th percentile of the standard normal
distribution” and resulted in 0.4 ng/mL for each reagent lot. The claimed LoD for the
modified Access Ferritin on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.4 ng/mL.
LoQ: For the determination of the LoQ, eight to twelve serum samples containing low levels
of ferritin were measured. Samples were tested in replicates of nine per run, one run per day,
over five total days on each pack lot and instrument for a minimum of 40 total datapoints for
each sample on each lot. A variance components model was used to estimate the within-run
and within-laboratory (total) %CV for each sample on each instrument and reagent lot
combination. The estimated LoQ of the modified Access Ferritin was set to be the ferritin
concentration which met the within-laboratory imprecision of 20% CV. The claimed LoQ for
the modified Access Ferritin on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.6 ng/mL.

CLSI Guideline EP09c, 3rd Edition was followed to compare the modified Access Ferritin on
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer to the predicate device, the Access Ferritin on the
Access 2 Immunoassay System. Patient samples falling within the analytical measuring
interval of both Access Ferritin assays were evaluated. A total of 147 deidentified serum
samples were tested with the modified Access Ferritin on three DxI 9000 instruments and
three Access 2 instruments with three reagent pack lots and three calibrator lots. The
comparison between paired measurements was analyzed by fitting the observed Access
Ferritin Assay on DxI 9000 instrument (dependent variable, y) into a linear regression model,
with the observed Access Ferritin Assay on Access 2 values as the only independent variable
(x, predicate), using Passing-Bablok method. The results are summarized in the following
table:
