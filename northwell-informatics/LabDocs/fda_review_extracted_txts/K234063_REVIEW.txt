C Type of Test:
The T2Candida 1.1 Panel, performed on the T2Dx Instrument, is a molecular diagnostic assay
for the detection of the above listed Candida species from whole blood specimens obtained from
patients with signs and symptoms of invasive Candida infection.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
T2Candida 1.1 Panel and T2Dx Instrument is a qualitative T2 Magnetic Resonance (T2MR)
assay for the direct detection of Candida species in K EDTA human whole blood specimens
2
from patients with symptoms of, or medical conditions predisposing the patient to, invasive
fungal infections.
The T2Candida 1.1 Panel identifies five species of Candida and categorizes them into the
following three species groups:
1. Candida albicans and/or Candida tropicalis
2. Candida parapsilosis
3. Candida glabrata and/or Candida krusei
The T2Candida 1.1 Panel does not distinguish between C. albicans and C. tropicalis. The
T2Candida 1.1 Panel does not distinguish between C. glabrata and C. krusei.
The T2Candida 1.1 Panel is indicated for the presumptive diagnosis of candidemia. The
T2Candida 1.1 Panel is performed independent of blood culture. Concomitant blood cultures are
necessary to recover organisms for susceptibility testing or further identification, and for
organisms not detected by the T2Candida 1.1 Panel.
The T2Candida positive and negative External Controls (T2Candida QCheck Positive Kit and
the T2Dx QCheck Negative Kit) are intended to be used as quality control samples with the
T2Candida 1.1 Panel when run on the T2Dx Instrument. These controls are not intended for use
with other assays or systems.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use
Device performance was initially established with samples from adult patients. Panel
performance with samples from pediatric patients was supported by additional studies with
pediatric subjects. Panel performance with samples from neonates has not been established.

D Special Instrument Requirements:
The T2Candida 1.1 Panel is performed on the T2Dx Instrument.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The T2Candida 1.1 panel is a qualitative molecular diagnostic assay that detects Candida species
directly from whole blood. Together with the T2Dx Instrument, the T2Candida 1.1 panel uses
whole blood compatible PCR amplification followed by T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR)
detection. The T2Dx Instrument was originally evaluated in DEN140019 and is unchanged in
this submission.
To initiate testing, at least 3 mL of whole blood specimen is collected into a 4 mL K EDTA
2
vacutainer. The sample tube is loaded into the T2Candida Sample Inlet, which is then placed on
the T2Candida Base along with the T2Candida Reagent Tray. The Reagent Tray contains the
internal control, amplification reagent, enzyme, and the probe-coupled superparamagnetic
particles for each Candida target. The assembled pack is then inserted in the T2Dx instrument,
which executes all steps after specimen loading.
Two milliliters of blood specimen are automatically transferred to the T2Dx Instrument where
the red blood cells are lysed, Candida cells are concentrated and lysed, and Candida DNA is
amplified. Amplification products are detected by T2MR detection using species-specific probes
which are attached to the superparamagnetic particles. The assay provides an identification of
Candida albicans and/or Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida glabrata and/or
Candida krusei. The test does not distinguish between C. albicans and C. tropicalis. The test
does not distinguish between C. glabrata and C. krusei. Results are provided within 5 hours of
the initial blood draw.
B Principle of Operation:
The T2Candida Panel and T2Dx Instrument rely on PCR amplification of conserved sequences
to detect Candida species. The assay includes a single pair of pan-Candida primers that
hybridize to conserved sequences within the 5.8S and 26S ribosomal RNA operon of Candida
species and amplify the intervening transcribed spacer 2 sequence (ITS2) from nucleic acid
released from the lysed Candida cells contained in the specimen. The primers are mixed in a
ratio such that an asymmetric product produces a predominantly single stranded nucleic acid
after amplification. The primers are designed to also amplify the internal control. Species-
specific and internal control-specific probes provide the specificity of the assay.
The instrument detects the amplified PCR product directly in the whole blood matrix by
amplicon-induced agglomeration of superparamagnetic particles attached to the species-specific
and internal control-specific probes. The detection method measures the spin-spin relaxation
signals of water molecules. For these measurements, the T2Dx Instrument utilizes a small
permanent magnet and a specialized radio frequency coil to measure the T2MR signal from the
water molecules. T2MR measures the disorder of the nuclear spins of the water molecules
K234063 - Page 3 of 9

--- Page 4 ---
contained in the sample and this disorder is directly proportional to the superparamagnetic
particle clustering state. The T2Dx Instrument reports a positive or negative result for each
detection channel: C. albicans/C. tropicalis (A/T), C. parapsilosis (P), C. krusei/ C. glabrata
(K/G) and internal control (IC).

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
Most analytical performance metrics of the T2Candida 1.1 Panel were previously established in
DEN140019 and K173536 and remain applicable under the expanded use with pediatric subjects.
The sample matrix (human blood), device design, and sample workflow remain unchanged. In
this submission, additional analytical studies were conducted as deemed necessary to ensure
safety and effectiveness in this specific patient population. This approach is in accordance with
the Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices Guidance (2014).
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Device precision/reproducibility was assessed and deemed acceptable in DEN140019. Refer
to the DEN140019 Decision Summary for additional details.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical Specificity
Cross-reactivity was previously assessed with 80 non-target, clinically relevant or
environmental organisms in DEN140019 and select species were found to be cross-reactive
(see DEN140019 Decision Summary).
Additional cross-reactivity testing was performed in this submission using five organisms
clinically relevant to pediatric populations: Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria
monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus mitis, and Neisseria meningitidis.
Isolates were tested in triplicate at a concentration of 106 CFU/mL. Any organism that
demonstrated cross-reactivity or gave an invalid result was further evaluated with additional
replicates from two additional sample preparations at the same concentration and was tested
at lower, more clinically relevant concentrations of organisms in blood (100-1000 CFU/mL).
Cross-reactivity was defined as an increase in the T2 signal above the established cutoff for
the Candida detection channel when tested at clinically relevant concentrations. Cross-
reactivity required both amplification of the organism with the pan-Candida primers and
subsequent detection with any of the capture probes. Of the five organisms tested, two
demonstrated cross-reactivity at 106 CFU/mL (S. agalactiae, H. influenzae). Cross-reactivity
was not observed when the organisms were re-tested at 1000 CFU/mL. The remaining three
organisms did not demonstrate cross-reactivity (Table 1). The data are acceptable.

*For any cross-reactive result, two additional unique sample preparations were tested at the same concentration.
Results were not considered cross-reactive if only one replicate demonstrated cross-reactivity.
Interference
An interference substances study was conducted as part of DEN140019. Results indicated
interference with the signal for Candida species or with the signal for the internal control for
the following substances: Feraheme, Magnevist, EDTA, Ablavar, and samples with an
interferent simulating lipemia (Intralipid). Refer to the DEN140019 Decision Summary for
additional information.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Internal and external controls are unchanged in this submission and were previously
validated in DEN140019. Refer to the DEN140019 Decision Summary for additional
information.
Sample and reagent stability was previously validated in DEN140019 and K173536:
• Specimen stability at 2-8°C
• Lysis tube and reagent stability/shelf-life (12 months)
• Shipping stability
Use with pediatric populations will not alter the internal/external controls or stability. The
data above are acceptable for the T2Candida 1.1 Panel.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of detection for each Candida species was previously determined in DEN140019.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not applicable. See Clinical Studies below.
2. Matrix Comparison:
Not applicable.
C Clinical Studies:
Clinical study data from DEN140019 as well as additional data from studies that used the
T2Candida 1.1 Panel with pediatric subjects were leveraged to support clinical performance of
the device in subjects inclusive of adult and pediatric ages. This approach was based on the
principles in the FDA Guidance, Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices. As the
course of the disease (invasive candidemia) is similar in adult and pediatric patients and the
sample workflow and technological characteristics of the device remain unchanged, the amended
labeling was supported by the existing clinical validation data conducted with adults.
The following principles were considered and deemed acceptably similar between the predicate
device, as previously established for adult patients, and the subject device for a broader age-
range subject population:
• Biological similarity of the sample (human whole blood)
• Biological similarity of disease in patient sub-populations
• No changes to device technology, design, reagents, or sample workflow
To further support testing in a pediatric population, data were evaluated from two studies from
peer-reviewed literature in which the T2Candida 1.1 Panel was used to test samples from
pediatric subjects. Detailed enrollment criteria, clinical protocols, patient demographic and
clinical information, testing protocols, and detailed line data were provided for assessment. All
samples were tested in accordance with the T2Candida 1.1 Panel instructions for use and
compared to speciated Candida results from blood culture. A total of 246 samples were
evaluated from patients aged <1 year to 17 years. Low prevalence (as determined by positive
blood culture) was observed (1.2%). For all samples, estimates of sensitivity (PPA) ranged from
50-100% and specificity (NPA) ranged from 97-99%. The totality of data from pediatric and
adult subjects support testing with the expanded patient age population.
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical sensitivity was determined in DEN140019 using prospective and contrived samples.
