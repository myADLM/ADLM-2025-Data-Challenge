III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Stelo Glucose Biosensor System is an over-the-counter (OTC) integrated Continuous
Glucose Monitor (iCGM) intended to continuously measure, record, analyze, and display glucose
values in people 18 years and older not on insulin. The Stelo Glucose Biosensor System helps to
detect normal (euglycemic) and low or high (dysglycemic) glucose levels. The Stelo Glucose
Biosensor System may also help the user better understand how lifestyle and behavior
modification, including diet and exercise, impact glucose excursion.
The user is not intended to take medical action based on the device output without consultation
with a qualified healthcare professional.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
No MRI/CT/diathermy — MR unsafe: Don't wear any Stelo Glucose Biosensor system
component during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or high-frequency electrical heat
(diathermy) treatment. However, it's safe to have a CT scan if you keep the sensor out of the
scanned area and cover the sensor with a lead apron during the scan. The Stelo Glucose
Biosensor system hasn't been tested in those situations when used during an MRI scan,
diathermy, or in the scanned area of a CT scan. The magnetic fields and heat could damage Stelo
Glucose Biosensor system components, which may cause inaccurate sensor readings.
With the Stelo Glucose Biosensor system, you can take a standard or maximum acetaminophen
dose of 1 gram (1,000 mg) every 6 hours and still use the Stelo Glucose Biosensor system.
Taking higher than the maximum dose of acetaminophen (e.g. > 1 gram every 6 hours in adults)
may affect the sensor readings and make them look higher than they really are.
If you are taking hydroxyurea, your sensor readings will be higher than your actual glucose. The
level of inaccuracy depends on the amount of hydroxyurea in your body. Talk to your physician
about alternative glucose monitoring approaches.
Don't use if you have problematic hypoglycemia. The Stelo Glucose Biosensor system hasn't
been designed for these populations. Consult with your healthcare provider to discuss which
Dexcom product is right for you.
Don't use if you are on dialysis. The Stelo Glucose Biosensor system performance hasn't been
evaluated in these populations and sensor readings may be inaccurate.
Only insert your sensor on the back of your upper arm. Don't wear your sensor on other sites
(such as your abdomen), as it may not work as expected.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Stelo Glucose Biosensor System System is a home use device that is intended to
continuously measure the glucose in the interstitial fluid, calculate the glucose reading and make
this value available to the user. The Stelo System can reliably and securely transmit glucose
measurement data to authorized digitally connected devices. The Stelo System is not intended to
be used in conjunction with insulin devices such as insulin pens and Automated Insulin Dosing
(AID) systems.
The Stelo System is based on the same principle of operation, fundamental design, and physical
characteristics as the G7 CGM System, Dexcom’s most recent prescription integrated continuous
glucose monitoring (iCGM) system (predicate device: K231081). The Stelo System comprises
the following two subsystems:
1. Glucose Sensing Subsystem (GSS): Wearable (Sensor, Transmitter, and Patch) and
Applicator
The sensor is a small and flexible wire inserted by the applicator into subcutaneous tissue
where it converts glucose into electric current. The transmitter is pre-connected to the
sensor and is worn on the body by the adhesive patch. The transmitter measures the
electric current produced by the sensor and converts these measurements into estimated
glucose values (EGV) using an onboard algorithm. The transmitter sends glucose data to
a mobile application.
Each GSS box also includes an overpatch, which is a general adhesive tape that helps
with the adhesion of the wearable to the user’s body.
2. Mobile Applications Subsystem (MAS): iOS and Android Mobile Application (App)
The App provides in-app guidance for the user on how to apply and set up the wearable
and how to create a user account. Once the set-up has been completed, the App receives
information from the transmitter and acts as a user interface by indicating the system state
(e.g., warm-up period, signal loss, etc.) and displaying glucose readings and trend graphs.
Stelo Glucose Sensing Subsystem (GSS)
The Stelo GSS has the same hardware design as the predicate device (G7 GSS); the devices use
the same sensor, patch, applicator, and transmitter hardware. In addition, the Stelo transmitter
firmware has the same primary responsibilities as the predicate G7 transmitter firmware.
While the firmware modes, firmware modules, wireless communication requirements, and
algorithm inputs/outputs of the Stelo transmitter firmware remain the same as the predicate
device, the Stelo transmitter firmware includes the following differences:
• No optional calibration
The Stelo transmitter firmware is factory calibrated only and does not use any
o
Blood Glucose (BG) entered by the lay user for calibration.
• Device connectivity restrictions
The Stelo transmitter firmware does not pair/connect to an additional dedicated
o
primary display device (e.g., a receiver), insulin pens, AID systems, or other
K234070 - Page 3 of 21

--- Page 4 ---
unauthorized devices. The Stelo transmitter can only pair/connect to the user’s
(personal) smartphone.
• Extended (15.5 days) device wear duration
The Stelo transmitter firmware supports a sensor wear duration of 15 days,
o
compared to 10 days for the predicate.
• Algorithm modifications
The algorithm was modified to support the extended wear duration while
o
maintaining the accuracy of the device. Additional algorithm modifications and
parameter optimizations were also introduced to help improve the user experience
(e.g., reducing jitteriness of glucose readings displayed in the trend graph and
better handling of edge cases or specific scenarios users may encounter in the
field).
Stelo Mobile Application System (MAS)
The Stelo MAS consists of the Stelo app that is available on both iOS and Android platforms.
The app can be downloaded to a compatible, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled smart
device. The Stelo app was developed using the same software development kit (SDK) as the
predicate device (G7 app) and inherited the main functionality and UI elements: in-app
onboarding, current glucose value, trend graph, in-app Clarity card, event logging, and
connectivity to Dexcom’s cloud servers. The following main UI elements were tailored to the
Stelo user population:
• Stelo app onboarding
Similar to the predicate device, the Stelo app includes an onboarding experience
o
to guide users through inserting the wearable and setting up the app. Instructions
and safety information are tailored to the Stelo user population.
• App update interval
The Stelo app wirelessly receives glucose information from the transmitter every
o
five minutes. All the sensor readings are then displayed on the mobile app every
15 minutes
• Narrowed displayed glucose range
Similar to the predicate device, the sensor measures glucose values within the 40-
o
400 mg/dL range and sends the glucose data to the Stelo app. The Stelo app then
narrows the displayed glucose values to 70-250 mg/dL. The displayed glucose
range is intended to provide the glucose range pertinent to the Stelo user
population who may not often have glucose values less than 70 mg/dL and more
than 250 mg/dL. Glucose values below this range are reported as “Below 70
mg/dL” and glucose values above this range are reported as “Above 250 mg/dL.”
• Insights
The user can review their latest time in range (day by day and at the end of a
o
session) through "Insights," a feature that calculates how much time the user's
glucose was in range during the preceding day(s). The Insights also present
suggestions for how the user can increase the time in range. Insights are delivered
to the user as an out-of-app notification and can also be accessed from within the
Stelo app.
• Alerts removal
Glucose alerts and alarms (e.g., Urgent Low Alarm, Urgent Low Soon, Low,
o
High, Rising Fast, and Falling Fast Alerts) are not included in the Stelo app,
K234070 - Page 4 of 21

--- Page 5 ---
unlike the predicate G7 app. The Stelo app provides lock screen and in-app visual
notifications to the user such as Bluetooth off, Signal Loss, or Sensor Expired.
B Principle of Operation:
The Stelo Glucose Biosensor System detects glucose levels from the fluid just beneath the skin
(interstitial fluid). The sensor probe continuously measures glucose concentration in the
interstitial fluid via an enzymatic electrochemical reaction using glucose oxidase. The enzyme,
glucose oxidase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and produces hydrogen peroxide. The
production of hydrogen peroxide generates an electrical current that is proportionate to the
interstitial glucose concentration. The transmitter converts the signal using an algorithm to a
glucose value read in mg/dL, which is then transmitted to the mobile application for the user to
see and use accordingly.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Stelo Glucose Biosensor performance was evaluated in clinical studies described below in
section C(3). A subset of subjects wore two Stelo Glucose Biosensor at the same time
(N=18). Precision was evaluated by comparing the glucose reading from the two Systems
worn by the same subject on the backs of both upper arms.
The mean paired absolute relative difference (between the 2 concurrently worn devices) was
8.8% and the mean coefficient of variation (mean %CV) was 6.2%.

Matched Pairs (n) 63,024
Number of subjects (N) 18
Paired absolute difference (mg/dL) 13.3
Paired absolute relative difference (%) 8.8
Coefficient of variation (%) 6.2
2. Linearity:
The measurement range of the System is 40-400 mg/dL and the reportable range is 70-250
mg/dL. Data supporting this claimed measurement range was generated in the clinical study
described in Section C(3) below.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Users of the Stelo Glucose Biosensor System can take a standard or maximum dose of
acetaminophen (up to 1 gram every 6 hours in adults) and still use the Stelo System readings.
Sensor glucose readings will be falsely higher if the user is taking more than a standard
acetaminophen dose.
Sensor glucose readings will also be falsely higher if the user is taking hydroxyurea. Users
should talk to their physician about alternative glucose monitoring approaches if they are
taking hydroxyurea.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
See Linearity section above.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The Stelo GSS (sensor and transmitter) has a storage shelf-life of up to 10 months. Shelf life
was evaluated at 86°F. Sensors should be stored at 36°- 86°F and 10-90% relative humidity.

Trend Accuracy
Trend accuracy describes the accuracy of the sensor during times of rapidly changing glucose
and is characterized by slopes, such as from > 2 mg/dL/min to < -2 mg/dL/min. Trend
accuracy was assessed by the concurrence rate of the glucose rate of change (changes in
mg/dL of glucose per minute) determined by the iCGM values and the corresponding
comparator values for each iCGM-comparator measurement pair.

Agreement when iCGM Reads “Below 70 mg/dL” or “Above 250 mg/dL”
The Stelo Glucose Biosensor System reports glucose readings between 70 and 250 mg/dL.
When the system determines the sensor reading is below 70 mg/dL, it displays “Below 70
mg/dL” on the mobile app. When the system determines the sensor reading is above 250
mg/dL, it displays “Above 250 mg/dL” on the mobile app. Because the System does not
display glucose values below 70 mg/dL or above 250 mg/dL, the comparisons to the actual
blood glucose levels (as determined by the comparator method) when the iCGM value is
classified as “Below 70 mg/dL” or “Above 250 mg/dL” is evaluated separately, and the
cumulative percentages of when the comparator values were less than certain glucose values
(for “Below 70 mg/dL”) and when comparator values were greater than certain glucose
values (for “Above 250 mg/dL”) are presented in the table below.

Sensor Stability
Sensor stability describes the performance over the sensor’s intended lifetime (up to 15 days,
including the optional 12-hour grace period). Performance was estimated by calculating the
percentage of iCGM readings within 15 mg/dL or 15% (15/15%), 20 mg/dL or 20%
(20/20%), and 40 mg/dL or 40% (40/40%) of the laboratory comparator values during the
beginning (Day 1 to 3), early middle (Day 4 to 7), late middle (Day 9 to 12), and end (Day 13
to the first half of Day 15) of the System lifecycle. The mean of the absolute relative
difference was evaluated over the sensor life within the measuring range.

Sensor Life
A total of 131 sensors worn on the arm by adult subjects were evaluated to determine the
percentage of sensors that lasted through the 15-day sensor life. Of the 131 Sensors, 73.5% of
evaluable sensors lasted until the final day of use. Some sensors were excluded from this
analysis if they were intentionally removed prior to day 15. For example, on or before day
15, 60 sensors were intentionally removed by the sponsor as part of the clinical study. 26
Sensors (19.8%) had “early sensor shut-off” (ESS), which is when a sensor automatically
ends a sensor session as a result of self-diagnostics. Survival rates were calculated using the
Kaplan Meier method.

A subsequent study was conducted in 108 participants in the intended user population to
assess the impact of a new sensor patch intended to improve the sensor survival rate. Subjects
attended clinic sessions for device insertion and removal. Sensor insertions were performed
at the clinic by the subjects. All subjects wore an overlay with the device (also called an
overpatch). No blood draws or home self-monitored blood glucose testing were required for
this study. No display devices were provided to subjects, so all system data were blinded to
the subjects for the full wear period and could not be used for subjects’ diabetes
management. A total of 80 of 110 systems lasted until Day 15, 6 of which were intentionally
removed on or prior to day 15 and were censored from the survival rate analysis. 17 sensors
had early sensor shutoff (ESS) and 5 had an adhesive failure. Survival rates were calculated
using the Kaplan Meier method.
