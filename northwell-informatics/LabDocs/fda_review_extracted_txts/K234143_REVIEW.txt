B Indication(s) for Use:
The i-STAT TBI test is a panel of in vitro diagnostic immunoassays for the quantitative
measurements of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase
L1 (UCH-L1) in whole blood and a semi-quantitative interpretation of test results derived from
these measurements, using the i-STAT Alinity instrument. The interpretation of test results is
used, in conjunction with other clinical information, to aid in the evaluation of patients, 18 years
of age or older, presenting with suspected mild traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale
score 13-15), which may include one of the following four clinical criteria: 1) any period of loss
of consciousness, 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before and after the accident, 3)
any alteration in mental state at the time of accident, and/or 4) focal neurological deficits, within
24 hours of injury, to assist in determining the need for a CT (computed tomography) scan of the
head. A ‘Not Elevated’ test interpretation is associated with the absence of acute traumatic
intracranial lesions visualized on a head CT scan.
The test is to be used with venous whole blood collected with EDTA anticoagulant in point of
care or clinical laboratory settings by a healthcare professional.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

D Special Instrument Requirements:
i-STAT Alinity (K153357)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The i-STAT TBI cartridge is a multiplex immunoassay that contains assays for both GFAP and
UCH-L1. The assays test for the presence of these biomarkers in a single whole blood sample
and yield a semi-quantitative test interpretation based on measurements of both GFAP and UCH-
L1 in approximately 15 minutes. The i-STAT TBI cartridge is designed to be run only on the i-
STAT Alinity instrument. Each i-STAT TBI cartridge contains all the necessary reagents needed
to perform the test.
The i-STAT Alinity instrument is a handheld, in vitro diagnostic device. The instrument is the
main user interface of the i-STAT System and functions as the electro-mechanical interface to
the test cartridge. The instrument executes the test cycle, acquires, and processes the electrical
sensor signals converting the signals into quantitative results. These functions are controlled by a
microprocessor.
Assayed quality control materials available for use with the i-STAT TBI cartridge include i-
STAT TBI Controls and the i-STAT TBI Calibration Verification Levels 1-3.
K234143 - Page 2 of 31

--- Page 3 ---
• The i-STAT TBI Controls can be used to monitor performance of the GFAP and UCHL1
assays within the i-STAT TBI cartridge on the i-STAT Alinity instrument. The i-STAT
TBI Controls have two levels: i-STAT TBI Control Level 1 and i-STAT TBI Control
Level 2 and each level is packaged separately. The controls are sold separately from the
cartridges.
• The i-STAT TBI Calibration Verification Levels 1-3 can be used to verify the pre-set
calibration of the i-STAT TBI cartridge throughout the reportable range. Calibration
verification materials are sold separately from the cartridges.
B Principle of Operation:
The i-STAT TBI cartridge consists of the UCH-L1 and GFAP assays and uses the sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method with electrochemical detection of the
resulting enzyme signal. The immunoassay uses anti-UCH-L1/alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and
anti-GFAP/ALP antibody conjugates for labeling/detection (detection antibody-ALP conjugates)
and anti-UCH-L1 and anti-GFAP monoclonal antibodies for capture (capture antibodies) that
together allow for the detection and measurement of antigen in a whole blood sample. The
detection and capture antibodies recognize distinct regions or epitopes on their respective
antigens. All the steps of the ELISA are automated and conducted inside the test cartridge.
The multiplex design is based on the high degree of specificity inherent in antibody/antigen
interactions. Additionally, the architecture of the cartridge and sensor design affords separation
of these two antibody/antigen combinations such that the electrochemical signals arising from
each analyte are measured independently at different areas of the biosensor chip contained within
the cartridge.
The biosensor chip inside the cartridge features two electrochemical capture sensors that consist
of microfabricated amperometric electrodes on a silicon substrate. After sample addition to the
cartridge, the detection antibody-ALP conjugates dissolve into the sample and are released from
the sensor. The capture antibodies immobilized on separate sensors on the chip capture the
antigens (GFAP and UCH-L1) present in the sample that have bound to the detection antibody-
ALP conjugate to form a sandwich (detection antibody-ALP conjugate/antigen/capture antibody)
during an incubation period of approximately 12 minutes. After a wash step to remove excess
labeling antibody conjugate and non-specifically bound proteins, the antigen is measured as
electrochemical signal generated through enzymatic conversion of the ALP substrate present in
the wash fluid. The current is proportional to the amount of labeled antigen (GFAP/UCH-L1
immobilized on the sensor. This electrical signal is converted into a quantitative measurement of
the whole blood concentration of GFAP and UCH-L1 reported in units of pg/mL.
The user interface includes a touch screen display, audible signals, and ability to input
information using a barcode reader and the touch screen. Based on the quantitative measurement
of the whole blood concentration of GFAP and UCH-L1 (pg/mL), an interpretation (semi-
quantitative result) is first displayed on the screen (“Elevated,” “Not Elevated,” or “Repeat
Test”). A second page displays the quantitative results of each test. The table below provides the
test interpretation matrix based on the GFAP and UCH-L1 assay results relative to cut-offs. The
assay cut-offs were established to be 65 pg/mL for GFAP and 360 pg/mL for UCH-L1.

quantitative result due to signals received from a particular sensor on the cartridge being detected as
uncharacteristic. Because the other assay provides a result at or above cut-off, a test interpretation can be
reported.
## Results are not available for either assay, or a result is available for one assay with the other assay providing a
result below cut-off. In these circumstances, an error code “QCF125” will be displayed with instruction to
repeat the test.
A “Not Elevated” test interpretation is associated with the absence of acute traumatic intracranial
lesions visualized on a head CT scan. An “Elevated” test interpretation suggests further
evaluation by head CT scan should be considered. A “Repeat Test” test interpretation indicates
suppressed (not reported) results for both assays or suppressed results (not reported) from one
assay and the other assay providing a result below cut-off. In these circumstances, an error code
(Quality Check Failure, or QCF) will be displayed with instruction for the end-user to repeat the
test (no more than once).

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
All results met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision studies were conducted based on the CLSI guideline EP05-A3. Samples in the
test panel evaluated in each precision study were generated to cover the measuring interval of
the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays. All studies except whole blood precision used plasma
samples as the protocol required testing over multiple days which is not possible with whole
blood samples. Pooled plasma samples were generated from whole blood collected in
K EDTA tubes from normal healthy donors. Plasma samples near GFAP and UCH-L1 cut-
2
offs were spiked with native antigen from plasma of subjects with traumatic brain injury
(TBI) to mimic clinical specimens more closely. Other samples evaluated in the study were
spiked with recombinant GFAP and UCH-L1.
a. Within-laboratory precision:
The study was conducted to evaluate within-laboratory precision of the GFAP and UCH-
L1 assays within the i-STAT TBI cartridge on the i-STAT Alinity Instrument using
plasma samples. The test panel consisted of five samples for GFAP and six samples for
UCH-L1. Each panel member was tested at a single site for at least 20 days, by at least
two operators, with two runs per day, two replicates per run, on three lots of i-STAT TBI
cartridges, using multiple i-STAT Alinity instruments, to generate a total of 240
replicates per panel member, respectively. Runs were separated by a minimum of 2
hours. Two levels of i-STAT TBI control material, L1 (i-STAT TBI Control Level 1) and
L2(i-STAT TBI Control Level 2), were also run in the study.
The data were analyzed in both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results are
summarized in the tables below for the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays.

The site-to-site reproducibility of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays within the i-STAT TBI
cartridge on the i-STAT Alinity instrument was evaluated using plasma samples at three
clinical sites. The medical facilities in the study were representative of the POC setting in
which the i-STAT TBI test is intended to be used and the two operators at each site, who
performed the testing, were representative of end-users of the i-STAT System. At each of
three sites, the test panel that included six GFAP samples and six UCH-L1 samples were
tested once per day for five days by two operators, with each operator using three i-STAT
TBI cartridges on three i-STAT Alinity instruments, to generate a total of 90 replicates
per sample. The data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The results are
summarized in the tables below for the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays.

d. Whole Blood precision study
The precision of GFAP and UCH-L1 assays within the i-STAT TBI cartridge on the i-
STAT Alinity instrument using whole blood was evaluated at three clinical POC sites
representative of the POC setting in which the i-STAT TBI test is intended to be used.
The two operators representing the end-users of the i-STAT System performed the testing
at each site. At each site, test samples were prepared by spiking prospectively collected
venous whole blood specimens with recombinant GFAP and/or UCH-L1 or human
plasma sample from TBI patients with native GFAP and UCH-L1. The whole blood test
samples included at least six samples of GFAP and six samples of UCH-L1 at each site to
evaluate the precision performance of each assay. At each site and for each level, a
minimum of one whole blood specimen was prepared and tested in three runs, by two

2. Linearity:
a. Linearity
The study was conducted to evaluate the linearity of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays within
the i-STAT TBI cartridge on the i-STAT Alinity instrument over the reportable range of each
assay per the CLSI guideline EP06-2nd Ed. Two studies for each assay were conducted in
parallel and the data from the studies were combined to evaluate the linearity for each assay.
One study used the native antigen, and the other study used the recombinant antigen at
concentrations that overlap with those of the native antigen. In each study, whole blood
samples of varying GFAP and UCH-L1 levels were prepared through proportional mixing of
low and high antigen concentration samples. The highest concentration sample with the
native antigen was created by spiking an aliquot of K EDTA whole blood with plasma (<5%
2
v/v) from a severe TBI patient exhibiting high levels of both GFAP and UCH-L1 antigens.
The highest concentration sample with the recombinant antigen was created by spiking whole
blood with recombinant GFAP and UCH-L1(<5% v/v) to target ranges. Samples with

intermediate levels of native and recombinant GFAP and UCH-L1 antigens were obtained
through a process of proportional mixing of low and high antigen concentration samples. For
evaluation of GFAP assay linearity, 10 sample levels of the native antigen samples and 17
sample levels of the recombinant antigen samples were generated. For evaluation of UCH-L1
assay linearity, 10 sample levels of the native antigen samples and 16 sample levels of the
recombinant antigen samples were generated. Ten replicates of each sample were tested in
the study, which was run over the course of a single day, using one cartridge lot and multiple
i-STAT Alinity instruments.
To evaluate linearity, weighted least squares regression analyses were performed using
replicates from all sample levels (native and recombinant) for both GFAP and UCH-L1
antigens, and an assessment of the deviation from linearity was determined for each sample
level for GFAP and UCH-L1. The results are summarized in the table below:
Test Range Slope Intercept R2
Assay % Deviation
(pg/mL) (95% CI) (95% CI) (95% CI)
1.0 -3.5 0.99
GFAP 17.6 -11303.9 8.0 to -13.4%
(0.99; 1.02) (-6.74; -0.23) (0.998; 1.000)
1.0 2.7 0.99
UCH-L1 86.4 - 3281.5 -0.8 to 2.6%
(0.96; 0.99) (-3.54; 8.86) (0.995; 0.999)
The study supports the linear range of 24.3 pg/mL to 11303.9 pg/mL for the GFAP and 86.4
pg/mL to 3281.5 pg/mL for the UCH-L1 assay with a deviation from linearity within 15%.
The results support the linearity throughout the reportable ranges of 65–10,000 pg/mL for
GFAP and 360–3200 pg/mL for UCH-LI.
b. Hook effect
To show that a clinical specimen with very high concentrations of antigen would not cause
false negative results (“Not Elevated” result) hook effect studies were performed. The testing
was conducted using one lot of i-STAT TBI cartridges, whole blood samples spiked to a high
antigen level for each assay (GFAP and UCH-L1), and multiple i-STAT Alinity instruments.
No hook effect was observed for the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays within the i-STAT TBI
cartridge using whole blood samples with antigen concentrations exceeding 100,000 pg/mL
GFAP and 100,000 pg/mL UCH-L1, respectively, when tested on the i-STAT Alinity
instrument.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Studies to evaluate the analytical specificity/interference were conducted using four lots of i-
STAT TBI cartridges and multiple i-STAT Alinity instruments. Two levels of GFAP and
UCH-L1 samples were evaluated in the studies: low (98–130 pg/mL) and high (585–715
pg/mL) GFAP, and low (540–720 pg/mL) and high (1440–2160 pg/mL) UCH-L1. Venous
whole blood samples collected in K EDTA anticoagulant from normal healthy donors was
2
used to create low-positive (low) and moderate-positive (high) GFAP and UCH-L1 base
pools for the preparation of the control samples and the potentially interfering test samples.
Recombinant GFAP and UCH-L1 was added to achieve the targeted GFAP and UCH-L1
concentrations.

a. Endogenous and exogenous interference
Each potentially interfering substance was tested at the toxic/pathological concentration
based on CLSI guideline EP37 Ed1, as applicable, and indicated in the tables below. The
effect of each substance at each level of GFAP and UCH-L1 was evaluated by comparing the
test results from a control sample, spiked with the appropriate solvent used to prepare the
stock solution of the potentially interfering substance, with the test results from a sample
spiked with a solution containing the potentially interfering substance as per CLSI guideline
EP07 Ed3. Each test and control sample were evaluated with at least 15 replicates for each
potentially interfering substance. A substance was identified as an interferent if the difference
in the means between the control and test samples was not within: ± 13 pg/mL or 10% of the
control sample mean for GFAP, and ± the greater of 40 pg/mL or 10% of the control sample
mean for UCH-L1. For any substances identified as an interferent at the initial concentration
tested, a dose response analysis was performed.
Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) were also evaluated as
potentially interfering endogenous substances. The low- and high-level GFAP and UCH-L1
samples were initially evaluated with screening concentrations of >160X HAMA and 1000
IU/mL RF, which are the concentrations of these substances evaluated in DEN170045.
Multiple test and control samples were generated for both the low- and high-level GFAP and
UCH-L1 samples, and at least 15 replicates of each sample were evaluated.

Among the endogenous substances, only albumin and RF were found to interfere with the
UCH-L1 assay and none of the endogenous substances interfered with the GFAP assay.
Among the exogenous substances, amphetamine, methadone, and d-methamphetamine were
found to interfere with the GFAP assay while cocaine, metoprolol, and propoxyphene
interfered with the UCH-LI assay. A dose-response study was performed to determine the
highest test concentrations of these exogenous and endogenous interferents at which no
interference could be demonstrated with the GFAP and UCH-L1 assay using samples with
high and low levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 and the results are summarized in the tables
below.

b. Cross-reactivity
A panel comprised of proteins that have significant homology to either GFAP or UCH-L1
was evaluated for cross-reactivity. The study was conducted using one lot of i-STAT TBI
cartridge, venous whole blood samples collected in K EDTA anticoagulant from healthy
2
donor spiked with either recombinant GFAP and/or UCH-L1 to achieve the targeted
concentrations of GFAP (98–130 pg/mL) and UCH-L1 (540–720 pg/mL), and multiple i-
STAT Alinity instruments. The concentrations of GFAP and UCH-L1 selected were
representative of a low positive concentration (low-positive defined as 1.5 – 2x the decision
level), for each assay, to provide insight into the potential for the cross-reactant substance to
affect medical decisions. Each potential cross-reacting substance was tested at a
concentration that corresponds to its highest reported physiological level reported in
circulation according to literature, as applicable, indicated in the table below, and as per
DEN170045. The effect of each potential cross-reactant was evaluated by comparing the test
results from a control sample, spiked with the appropriate solvent used to create the stock
solution of the potential cross-reactant, with the test results from a sample spiked with the
potentially cross-reacting substance as per CLSI guideline EP07 Ed3. Each test and control
sample were evaluated with a similar number of replicates, with at least 20 replicates
evaluated for each potentially cross-reacting substance.
Results as summarized in the table below demonstrate that none of the potentially cross-
reacting substances tested were found to interfere with the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays.

c. Cross-talk
The study was conducted to evaluate the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays within the i-STAT TBI
cartridge on the i-STAT Alinity instrument for potential cross-talk. Cross-talk is the potential
for high levels of the antigen (GFAP or UCH-L1) of one assay to impact the result of the
other assay. The study was conducted using one lot of i-STAT TBI cartridges, venous whole
blood collected in K EDTA anticoagulant from healthy donors and spiked to low and high
2
GFAP and UCH-L1 levels, and multiple i-STAT Alinity instruments. Two levels (low
positive and moderate positive) for both GFAP (98–130 pg/mL and 585–715 pg/mL) and
UCH-L1 (540–720 pg/mL and 1440–2160 pg/mL) were tested in the absence (control
sample) and presence (test sample) of a single high-level concentration of the other antigen
(at 100,000 pg/mL) for potential crosstalk. The potential for cross-talk was evaluated by
comparing the result from the control sample with the result from the corresponding test
sample containing the high level of the other antigen. Cross-talk is a subset of cross-
reactivity and, therefore, % cross-talk is based on the measure of % cross-reactivity described
in CLSI guideline EP07 Ed3. Results summarized in the table below show no cross-talk
effect was observed between the GFAP and UCH-L1 antigens.

Assay results are preceded by the symbol for greater than (>) or less than (<) if the result is

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a. Traceability: There are no internationally recognized standard reference materials
available for GFAP or UCH-L1. The traceability of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays within
the i-STAT TBI cartridge has been established against reference material created using
recombinant GFAP and UCH-L1 antigens that are expressed in and purified from
Escherichia coli. The reference materials are divided into aliquots and stored frozen at
-80°C.
b. i-STAT Cartridge Stability: A real-time shelf-life stability study performed on three lots
of i-STAT TBI cartridges support shelf-life claims of 6 months when stored at
refrigerated temperatures (2–8°C) and 14-days when stored at room temperature (18–
30°C).
c. Sample Stability and Storage: In order to evaluate fresh venous whole blood stability,
samples targeting three levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 that covered the reportable ranges
of the antigens were evaluated. Venous whole blood collected in K EDTA from 27
2
apparently healthy donors were each spiked with antigen (from either pooled TBI patient
samples or spinal cord lysate) to the three targeted concentration levels of GFAP and
UCH-L1, thereby generating a total of 30 samples total or 10 unique samples for each
GFAP and UCH-L1 level. The results for the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays in the i-STAT
TBI cartridge when tested on the i-STAT Alinity System demonstrated that whole blood
samples collected with EDTA anticoagulant are stable up to 60 minutes at room
temperature (18–30oC).
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the
GFAP and UCH-L1 assays in the i-STAT TBI cartridge on the i-STAT Alinity System were
determined based on CLSI EP17-A2.
For LoB, the study was conducted over four days, using three cartridge lots and fresh whole
blood samples from 16 apparently healthy donors altered to achieve blank GFAP and UCH-
L1 levels. The blank sample results were evaluated for each cartridge lot, and the final LoB
was determined as the greater of the LoB values obtained for each of the three cartridge lots.
For LoD, the study was conducted over four days, using three cartridge lots and fresh whole
blood samples from 18 apparently healthy donors altered to achieve low GFAP and UCH-L1
levels. The low-level sample results were evaluated for each cartridge lot, and the final LoD
was determined as the greater of the LoD values obtained for each of the three cartridge lots.
For LoQ, the study was conducted over six days, using three cartridge lots and fresh whole
blood from 12 apparently healthy donors altered to achieve 11 low-level samples of GFAP
and 12 low level samples of UCH-L1. The low-level sample results were evaluated for each
cartridge lot, and the final LoQ were determined as the greater of the LoQ results obtained
for each of the three cartridge lots at a precision limit of 20 %CV.

The result for the analytical sensitivity is presented in the table below:
Lower Limit of
LoB LoD LoQ Claimed LoQ

(pg/mL)
GFAP 13 27 47 47 65
UCH-L1 0 32 32* 87 360
* The estimated LoQ for the UCH-L1 assay of 30 pg/mL was lower than the estimated LoD. Due to this, the
recommended reportable LoQ for UCH-L1 assay will be the same as the LoD estimate of 32 pg/mL as per
CLSI EP17-A2. The linearity study results support LoQ for UCH-L1 to be 87 pg/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:

The cut-off for UCH-L1: 360 pg/mL

2. Matrix Comparison:
i. Plasma versus Whole Blood
The matrix equivalency between plasma and whole blood samples collected with
K EDTA (dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) anticoagulant was evaluated with
2
the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays in the i-STAT TBI cartridge on the i-STAT Alinity
System according to the study design recommended in CLSI EP35. The study was
conducted using three lots of i-STAT TBI cartridges and paired whole blood (primary
specimen type) and plasma (candidate specimen type) samples with K EDTA
2
anticoagulant representing levels across the reportable range of the GFAP and UCH-L1
assays. Venous whole blood was collected without anticoagulant and used to prepare
samples for each assay (GFAP and UCH-L1) across the reportable range. Each donor
specimen was used to prepare samples at five concentration levels of GFAP and five
concentration levels of UCH-L1 across the reportable range to generate a total of 67
paired specimens for GFAP and 70 paired specimens for UCH-L1. The prepared whole
blood samples were dispensed into K EDTA tubes, split for whole blood sample (primary
2
specimen type) testing, and centrifuged to separate plasma samples (candidate specimen
type) for testing. Each paired sample was tested in duplicate on the same day and the first
valid replicate GFAP or UCH-L1 result of the plasma sample was compared to the first
valid replicate GFAP or UCH-L1 result of the whole blood sample by Passing-Bablok
regression. The results are summarized in the table below.

TBI cartridges and paired whole blood samples in K EDTA (primary specimen type) and
2
K EDTA (candidate specimen type) representing levels across the reportable range of the
3
GFAP and UCH-L1 assays. Venous whole blood was collected without anticoagulant and
used to prepare samples for each assay (GFAP and UCH-L1) across the reportable range to
generate a total of 67 paired specimens for GFAP and 70 paired specimens for UCH-L1. The
prepared whole blood samples were transferred to tubes containing K EDTA and K EDTA
2 3
anticoagulant. Each paired sample was tested in duplicate on the same day and the first valid
replicate GFAP or UCH-L1 result of K EDTA whole blood sample was compared to the first
2
valid replicate GFAP or UCH-L1 result of the K EDTA whole blood sample by Passing-
3
Bablok regression. The slope, intercept, correlation coefficient (r), and their respective 95%
confidence intervals for both assays are summarized in the table below.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical Specificity:
A prospective, multi-center, observational study was conducted to evaluate the clinical
performance of the i-STAT TBI cartridge in classifying intended use population subjects
with suspected mild TBI for the likely absence of acute intracranial lesions visualized by a
head CT scan. Venous whole blood specimens were collected in EDTA within 24 hours of
the head injury from prospectively enrolled subjects, 18 years of age or older, who had
experienced a head injury and presented to the health care facility or the emergency
department (ED) with suspected mild TBI, with a GCS score of 13–15; and who had a head
CT scan ordered as part of their standard of clinical care. Each specimen was tested for
GFAP and UCH-L1 using two i-STAT TBI cartridges and two i-STAT Alinity instruments.
Testing was performed at 20 external point of care clinical sites across the United States. CT

scans were performed in accordance with the clinical site’s standard of care. Images were
transmitted to a central data capture system. Images were interpreted by at least two
neuroradiologists who were masked to other clinical and laboratory data; procedures for
scoring images were established before conducting image review. The clinical outcome was
based on the consensus interpretation of a subject’s CT scan between two neurologists.
Outcomes were classified as positive or negative as defined by the presence or absence of
acute traumatic intracranial lesions, respectively. Acute intracranial lesion was defined as any
trauma induced or related finding visualized upon head CT scan. A total of 970 specimens
were included in the study. The demographic characteristics of the enrolled subjects represented
in the performance analysis are summarized in the table below.

Of the 283 subjects with CT scan positive results, 10 subjects had an i-STAT TBI test
interpretation that was ‘Not Elevated’. The rate of false negative (FN) results was 3.5%
(10/283). None of these 10 subjects with false negative results required surgical intervention
related to their head injury as no neurosurgical lesions were identified by CT scan in these
subjects. Fourteen (14) subjects were identified with a lesion requiring neurosurgical
intervention and all these subjects were correctly classified as elevated (true positive) with i-
STAT TBI test interpretation. Of the 687 subjects associated with negative CT scan results,
the rate of false positive (FP) results by the i-STAT TBI was 59.6% (410/687). Of these, 277
subjects were associated with negative CT scan results. The negative predictive value (NPV)
of the assay was 96.5% (277/287) with prevalence of 29.2%. The potential benefit of the
assay would be a reduction in unnecessary CT scans by 40.3% (277 of 687 subjects had true
negative assay results). The positive predictive value (PPV) of the assay was 40% (273/683).
Adjusted NPV and PPV based on 6% CT scan positive prevalence rate are 99.4% (95% CI:
99.0%; 99.7%) and 9.4% (95% CI: 8.8%; 9.9%), showing the equivalent clinical
performance of the i-STAT TBI cartridge to the predicate device.
Analyses of assay performance by gender and time from injury relative to blood draw are
shown in the table below. The adjudicated head CT scan classification for each evaluable
subject and the first valid i-STAT TBI test interpretation obtained from blood drawn within
0–24 hours of injury were used to establish clinical performance. If results for time point T2
were not available for a subject, then the results from the blood draw within 12 hours of
injury (T1) were used in lieu of the T2 result. Of the 970 subjects, the T2 result was used for
350 subjects and the T1 result was used for the remaining 620 subjects.

* For ‘Gender Unspecified/ Not Reported’: Because of the small sample size of this group, some of the values
were 'not calculable' and were reported as N/A.
^ For sections “Time from injury to blood draw (T1)” and “Time from injury to blood draw (T2)”, each
timeframe incorporated the first valid result from all specimens collected in that timeframe, and each subject
result was represented only once per timeframe. Since several subjects had both T1 and T2 specimen results,
the sum of the subjects represented in these timeframes will be greater than the total number of evaluable
subjects (N=970).
The data showed little variation in NPV and PPV between males and females and with
increasing time from injury, indicating that gender differences and differences between head
injury characteristics did not translate into statistically significant differences in assay
performance.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Refer to Assay Cut-Off.
E Reference Range:
The expected values from 150 self-declared apparently healthy donors ranging in age from 18 to
79 (with mean age of 45.6 years) in the U.S. population who did not have acute injury to the
head (or history of neurological disease or disorder, neurosurgery, or motor vehicle accident or
injury requiring medical attention for head/neck/spine within the last one year) were determined

in accordance with CSLI guideline EP28-A3c. Data analysis was performed separately for the
GFAP and UCH-L1 assays in the i-STAT TBI Cartridge on the i-STAT Alinity System. The
2.5th and 97.5th percentiles (95% reference interval) and their respective 95% confidence intervals
for both biomarkers were calculated non-parametrically. The results are summarized in the table
below.
Reference Interval
Assay N
(2.5th to 97.5th percentile)
GFAP 150 < 47 – 53 pg/mL
UCH-L1 150 < 87 – 251 pg/mL
No subjects in the reference interval study were elevated for both GFAP and UCH-L1. One
subject had an elevated GFAP result, and no subjects had an elevated UCH-L1 result for the data
included in the 95% reference interval determination. There is little to no effect of age on the
biomarker positivity.
F Other Supporting Studies
i. Temperature Operating Range Study
The performance of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays in the i-STAT TBI cartridge using i-STAT
Alinity System across its temperature operating range (16.0°C to 30.0°C) was evaluated. Whole
blood samples from six apparently healthy donors were altered to target three GFAP (cut-off,
moderate-positive, and high-range) and three UCH-L1 (cut-off, low -positive, and high-range)
levels across the reportable range of each respective assay. Testing was performed in a controlled
temperature chamber below (16.0°C) and above (30.0°C) room temperature (referred to as test
condition) alongside testing in a location at controlled room temperature (21.0–25.0°C) (referred
to as control condition). The GFAP and UCH-L1 assays in the i-STAT TBI cartridge with the i-
STAT Alinity System demonstrated acceptable performance across the operating temperature
range of 16.0°C to 30.0°C for all GFAP and UCH-L1 levels tested.
ii. Cleaning Robustness
The robustness of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays (amperometric sensors) to cleaning and
disinfection was previously demonstrated using the predicate i-STAT TBI Plasma cartridge
(K201778). Based on commonality in design features to the predicate device, the previously
provided studies also support the robustness of subject i-STAT TBI cartridge.
iii. Altitude Effect
The performance of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays in the i-STAT TBI cartridge on the i-STAT
Alinity System at an altitude of approximately 7,500 feet (ft) above sea level using whole blood
specimens was evaluated across the reportable range of each assay. A barometric chamber was
used to simulate an altitude of approximately 7,500 feet above sea level (target altitude as the test
condition) and outside the chamber was used for sea level (approximately 403 feet elevation for
Dallas, Texas) (as the control condition). Based on guidance from EP09c, a Passing-Bablok
regression analysis and a predicted bias evaluation at the assay cut-offs between the two
conditions were performed. The results of the study for the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays in the i-
STAT TBI cartridge demonstrate equivalent performance between sea level (control condition)
and at an altitude of approximately 7,500 feet (ft) above sea level (test condition) when evaluated
with the i-STAT Alinity System.

iv. Tilting Study
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the robustness of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays in the
i-STAT TBI cartridge on the i-STAT Alinity System when the instrument is placed at a non-
level angle during a cartridge test cycle. The study was conducted using one lot of i-STAT TBI
cartridges and 30 i-STAT Alinity instruments. A whole blood sample from one donor was
collected in K EDTA anticoagulant and altered to target three GFAP and UCH-L1 levels across
2
the reportable range of each assay. Each sample was evaluated at five tilt angles, with a level
surface 0o as a control condition and -31o, -14o, 14o, and 31o as test conditions. The instruments
were tilted by inclining (screen angled towards sky) or declining (screen angled towards ground)
along the longitudinal axis. The impact of instrument tilt angle during testing was assessed by
comparing the GFAP and UCH-L1 results collected at the tilt angles (test conditions) to the
results collected on a level surface (control condition). The results demonstrated the robustness
of the fail-safe mechanism (quality check failure/QCF) that prevents erroneous results for the
GFAP and UCH-L1 assays from being reported when the i-STAT TBI cartridge is tested on the
i-STAT Alinity System at tilt angles of -31o, -14o, 14o, and 31o.
v. Vibration Study
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the robustness of the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays in the
i-STAT TBI cartridge on the i-STAT Alinity System when the instrument is exposed to vibration
during a cartridge test cycle. The study was conducted using one lot of i-STAT TBI cartridges
and six i-STAT Alinity instruments and a panel of frozen spiked plasma samples consisting of
three levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 across the reportable range for each assay. Each sample was
evaluated at three vibration levels, with no vibration as a control condition and 4.8 mm/s and 15
mm/s as test conditions. The impact of vibration during testing was assessed by comparing the
GFAP and UCH-L1 results collected in the presence of vibration (test conditions) to the results
collected with no vibration (control condition). The results of the study demonstrated that the
GFAP and UCH-L1 assays in the i-STAT TBI cartridge when tested on the i-STAT Alinity
System are insensitive to vibration up to 15 mm/s across the range of GFAP and UCH-L1 levels
tested.
vi. Hematocrit Sensitivity
The effect of hematocrit on the GFAP and UCH-L1 assays in the i-STAT TBI cartridge was
assessed across a hematocrit (HCT) range of 15–60% packed cell volume (PCV). The study was
conducted using two lots of i-STAT TBI cartridges and i-STAT Alinity instruments. Whole
blood samples from six donors were altered to target three GFAP and UCH-L1 levels (low,
moderate, and high) across the reportable range for each respective assay. Each sample was
evaluated at three HCT levels, with the nominal HCT level as control condition and low and high
HCT levels as test conditions. The HCT sensitivity at each GFAP and UCH-L1 level was
assessed by comparing the results at the low and high HCT levels (test conditions) to the nominal
HCT level (control condition). Imprecision (%CV) and bias exceeding 10% were observed for
low level GFAP samples with hematocrit levels above 56% PCV.
