III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
ACESO Early Pregnancy Test is intended for the qualitative detection of human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) in urine, as an aid in early detection of pregnancy, in some cases as early as
five (5) days before the expected period, i.e., as early as six (6) days before the day of the missed
period.
Important note regarding positive results:
Because this test detects low levels of hCG, it is possible that this test may give positive results
even if you are not pregnant. All results should be confirmed by your healthcare provider,
especially when making decisions about future medical care.
This device is intended for home-use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
Because this test detects low levels of hCG, it is possible that this test may give positive results
even if you are not pregnant. All results should be confirmed by your healthcare provider,
especially when making decisions about future medical care.
The device is intended for home-use only and not intended for clinical-care settings.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ACESO Early Pregnancy Test consists of a single test strip assembled in a plastic housing,
with an absorbent tip and is designed to be tested in dip or instream mode. The test is packaged
sealed with a desiccant and instructions for use. The result is displayed within the test window by
two distinct colored lines, one control line and one test line.
B Principle of Operation:
The ACESO Early Pregnancy Test is a qualitative, lateral flow immunoassay used for in vitro
qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. When the absorbent end
is exposed to a sample, the sample is absorbed into the device by capillary action and mixes with
the antibody-dye conjugate (mouse anti-beta hCG monoclonal antibody), flowing across the pre-
coated membrane, which is coated with goat anti-hCG polyclonal antibody. During the test, hCG
in the urine specimen reacts with the dye conjugate and forms a complex. The complex migrates
along the membrane to the hCG antibody line (T) and remains captured in the T line. The test
K234152 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
result is shown in the test window and read visually between 3 and 10 minutes of urine
application. A red colored band develops in the T line, indicating a positive result. If there is no
hCG or levels are below the cut-off in the urine, there is no red band in the test zone, indicating a
negative result. The Control line should develop in the control zone regardless of the test result.
Absence of a control line, even in the presence of a colored T line, indicates an invalid test result.

Because the device detects low levels of hCG that could be found in some non-pregnant women,
the sponsor included a limitation in the labeling (see Section III.C. above).
2. Linearity:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative device.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference from Endogenous and Exogenous Substances
To evaluate potential interference, a urine pool from non-pregnant healthy females was used
to prepare samples with hCG concentrations of 0, 3 and 10 mIU/mL, which were then spiked
with potentially interfering exogenous and endogenous substances at the concentrations listed
in the table below. Samples were tested in replicates of 3 by 3 operators using 3 lots of the
candidate device. No interference was observed at the concentrations shown in the table
below:

Cross-Reactivity of structurally-related compounds
To evaluate cross-reactivity, urine samples were spiked to hCG concentrations of 3 mIU/mL
and 10mIU/mL and then spiked with the following potential cross reactants: follicle-
stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH). Samples were tested in replicates of 3 by 3 operators using 3 lots of candidate device.
The results demonstrated no cross-reactivity from potential cross-reactants up to 1000
mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL FSH, 1 mIU/mL TSH in either samples at the claimed cutoff (10
mIU/mL) or below the claimed cutoff (3 mIU/mL).
Effects of hCG β-core (hCGβcf) fragment:
Interference testing was performed to evaluate whether high levels of β-core (hCGβcf)
fragment interfere with device performance. Negative urine samples (0 mIU/mL) and
negative samples spiked with hCG levels of 3 mIU/mL, 10 mIU/mL, and 20,000 mIU/mL
hCG were then spiked with hCGβcf at concentrations of 50,000 pmol/L, 125,000 pmol/L,
250,000 pmol/L and 500,000 pmol/L. Samples were tested in replicates of 5 by 3 operators
using 3 lots of the candidate device. The results show that the performance of the candidate
device is not affected by hCGβcf concentrations up to 500,000 pmol/L.

Effects of urine pH:
A study was performed to evaluate the effects of pH on device performance. Negative urine
samples (0 mIU/mL) and negative samples spiked with hCG to levels of 3 mIU/mL and 10
mIU/mL were adjusted to have pH values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0. The hCG samples
with the different pH levels were test in 3 replicates by 3 operators using 3 lots of the device.
The results demonstrated that changes in pH ranging from 4.0 to 9.0 do not interfere with
either positive or negative results from the device.
Effects of urine specific gravity:
A study was performed to evaluate the effects of urine specific gravity on device
performance. Negative urine samples (0 mIU/mL) and negative samples spiked with hCG
levels of 3 mIU/mL and 10 mIU/mL were adjusted to specific gravities of 1.000, 1.009,
1.015, 1.017, 1.020, 1.022, 1.028, and 1.035. Samples were tested in 3 replicates by 3
different operators using 3 lots of the device. The results demonstrated that changes in
specific gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.035 do not interfere with either positive or negative
results from the device.
Effects of hook effect study:
Negative urine samples were spiked with hCG at concentrations of 6,250, 12,500, 25,000,
50,000, 100,000, 200,000, and 500,000 mIU/mL. Three lots of the device were tested by 3
different operators. The results demonstrated that no hook effect was observed at hCG
concentration up to 500,000 mIU/mL.

urine specimen. Fifty-five (55) lay users tested using the instream sampling method and 45
lay users tested using the dip sampling method. Each subject also provided a sample for
professional testing. Lay user results compared to clinical pregnancy status and professional user
results are shown below. The data demonstrated 100% agreement between lay-user and
professional results.

Ease of use of the device was also assessed and demonstrated that users found the test easy to
perform and that all of the lay persons carried out the test correctly.
Lay user spiked sample study:
In a separate study, a total of 100 lay users (58 using dip method) and (42 using instream
method) each tested four urine samples spiked with 3, 5, 8, and 10mIU/mL hCG. Samples
were blinded and the order of testing was randomized. Professionals also conducted testing
with the spiked urine samples. A comparison of lay user and professional results for each
urine sample and sampling method is shown below.

Testing of Non-Pregnant Women:
Urine samples from 100 non-pregnant women were tested from each of the following three
cohorts: pre-menopausal (ages 18~40 years old), peri-menopausal (41~55 years old) and
post-menopausal (>55 years old). Three lots of the device were used and the lay user
performed their own tests using both dip and instream sampling methods. Results of the
study are shown in the table below.
