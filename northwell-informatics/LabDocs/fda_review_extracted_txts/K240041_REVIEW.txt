III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The IVD CAPSULE PSP is a single-use, rapid in vitro diagnostic immunofluorescence assay for
the semi-quantitative determination of the concentration of pancreatic stone protein (PSP) in
human K2-EDTA (venous and arterial) and K3-EDTA (venous) whole blood.
The IVD CAPSULE PSP is to be used on the abioSCOPE in vitro diagnostic analyzer. This
diagnostic test is used in conjunction with other clinical assessments and laboratory findings to
aid in the early detection of sepsis manifesting within the first 3 days after testing. IVD
CAPSULE PSP generates PSP values that fall within one of three discrete Interpretation bands
based on increasing likelihood of sepsis.
The test is intended for professional use in clinical laboratory settings. It is indicated for use in
adult patients at high risk of sepsis presenting to intensive care units (ICUs).

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The IVD CAPSULE PSP is a sandwich immunofluorescence assay used on the abioSCOPE
instrument and is intended to measure the concentration of pancreatic stone protein (PSP) in human
K2-EDTA (venous and arterial) and K3-EDTA (venous) whole blood. The IVD CAPSULE PSP is a
single use test kit containing the following four components:
• The abioCAPSULE, a polystyrene plastic cartridge which consists of membranes that filter the
sample and drive the sample to the biosensors by capillary force. The abioCAPSULE also
includes an RFID tag containing relevant information of the test.
• The abioMIX, a screw-top microtube containing an antibody specific to human PSP in an
optimized buffered solution.
• An abioPIPETTE, used to mix 50 μL specimen with abioMIX and load the mixture on
abioCAPSULE.
• A desiccant, used to protect the contents of the sealed IVD CAPSULE from any potential
detrimental effects of ambient humidity during transportation and storage.
The abioSCOPE is a benchtop diagnostic device that measures analytes in biological samples. It is
composed of a fully automated fluorescence microscope and is operated through a high-resolution
touchscreen. The abioSCOPE uses a laser to excite the molecular complexes inside the biosensors
which leads to the emission of a fluorescence signal.
K240041 - Page 2 of 23

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
Test principle: The blood sample is mixed with a solution composed of a fluorescently labelled
monoclonal antibody specific to human PSP. The blood sample, now containing the PSP-antibody
complex, is loaded onto the capsule where it is drawn through the capsule by capillary action and
passes through a built-in separator that excludes particles from the measurement area. After passing
through the separator, the PSP-antibody complex is captured by anti-PSP monoclonal antibodies
immobilized within the read-out area of the capsule. The concentration of the captured PSP is
proportional to the fluorescence generated by the fluorophore conjugated to the detection antibody.
Test procedure: Briefly, 50 μL of patient blood sample is mixed with the provided reagent, abioMIX,
which contains fluorochrome labeled, mouse anti-human PSP antibody. The sample-reagent mixture
is then loaded into the port of the abioCAPSULE. Patient material is drawn through the capsule by
capillary action and passes through a built-in separator that excludes particles from the measurement
area. After passing through the separator, the PSP-antibody complex is bound by capture antibodies
(anti-human PSP) immobilized within the read-out area of the capsule. The abioCAPSULE is
inserted into the into the abioSCOPE to read the fluorescent signal. The concentration of the PSP in
the sample is proportional to the fluorescence generated by the abioSCOPE in the reading area. The
abioSCOPE uses the calibration information encoded in the abioSCOPE and in the capsule along
with the measured fluorescent signal to quantify the level of PSP in the patient’s blood sample and
express the PSP concentration in ng/mL.
The IVD CAPSULE PSP test results are interpreted using the following bin assignment indicating
level of sepsis risk for different PSP level ranges:
• PSP value ≥300 ng/ml: Increased risk of sepsis
• PSP value 100-299 ng/ml: Slightly increased risk of sepsis
• PSP value <100 ng/ml : Decreased risk of sepsis
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
abioSCOPE
2. Specimen Identification:
The IVD CAPSULE PSP to be used on the abioSCOPE in vitro diagnostic analyzer is
validated for use with human K2-EDTA (venous and arterial) and K3-EDTA (venous) whole
blood specimens. The whole blood specimen must be tested and analyzed within twenty-four
hours of blood draw.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The patient’s specimen is mixed with the provided abioMIX reagent and pipetted by the user
into the designated specimen loading port of the abioCAPSULE using the abioPIPETTE
provided with the kit. The users are instructed to pipette 50 μL of sample into the cartridge.
K240041 - Page 3 of 23

--- Page 4 ---
Each single-use kit package contains all necessary components for testing a single patient
specimen.
4. Calibration:
A calibration is unique to reagent and abioCAPSULE cartridge lot. The calibration process
assures that the unique characteristics of each device and the unique state of each cartridge
lot are accounted for in the calibration and that the concentration results are consistent and
accurate.
5. Quality Control:
The abioSCOPE evaluates internal quality controls at power-on and during measurement
after insertion of a capsule. If these internal controls fail, the abioSCOPE displays a specific
error message and the abioSCOPE user manual must be consulted.
Additionally, two quality control products (IVD CAPSULE Control PSP and abioSCOPE
Control) are available through Abionic SA. These quality controls can be used to verify that
both the IVD CAPSULE PSP and abioSCOPE, respectively, work properly. It is
recommended to use these quality controls:
- at least on a monthly basis;
- during training of new operators;
- anytime an unexpected test result with the IVD CAPSULE PSP kit is obtained;
- in compliance with the local regulatory requirements for quality control testing.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was conducted to evaluate between-operator, between-device and between
-lot precision of the device. The study evaluated five K3-EDTA plasma samples covering the
entire assay reportable range of the PSP assay (20 to 600 ng/ml). These samples were tested
in triplicate on two separate runs per day (morning and afternoon), separated by at least two
hours, for five non-consecutive days. The study included three operators, three abioSCOPE
devices and three kit lots. The test measurement procedure followed the instruction for use if
the product and the abioSCOPE. Equivalency between K3-EDTA plasma, K3-EDTA whole
blood, and K2-EDTA whole blood was established separately in a matrix equivalency study.
The study was designed and executed according to the guideline CLSI EP05-A3.

Given the automated nature of the test, site-to-site variability was expected to be minor. An
additional precision study was conducted at a different site to evaluate the between-
instrument and between-user components of precision with three K2-EDTA plasma samples
covering the entire assay reportable range of the IVD CAPSULE PSP product (20 to 600
ng/ml). These samples were tested in triplicate, in two runs per day (morning and afternoon)
separated by at least 2 hours, on 5 different (non-consecutive) days and on three abioSCOPE
2.0 devices. The observed between-user and between-instrument precision are summarized in
the table below.

A smaller study was performed to evaluate between-run variability with 23 K2-EDTA
anticoagulated whole blood samples spanning the assay reportable range (20 to 600 ng/ml).
Each sample was tested twelve times using 4 analyzers and multiple reagent lots during the
study. The variability (% CV) observed across the samples within the assay measuring range
was acceptable.
An additional 20-day precision study was performed to evaluate between day and between
run variability components of the within-laboratory precision by testing eight K3-EDTA
plasma samples covering the entire reportable range of the PSP assay (20 to 600 ng/ml).
These samples were tested in duplicate, in two runs per day (morning and afternoon)
separated by at least 2 hours, on 20 different (non-consecutive) days, on one abioSCOPE 2.0.

Overall, across all of the precision studies, less than 10% variability (%CV) was observed
between operators, between runs, between days, between instruments and between lots.
2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted evaluating a 13-level dilution series where a high PSP pool (S1)
sample was prepared by pooling three K3-EDTA plasma samples. The remaining 12 samples
were prepared by dilution of the S1 sample with the PSP-depleted K3-EDTA plasma.
Samples (7 replicates/ level) were supplemented with red blood cells to reach a 38% hematocrit (v/v)
before testing. Equivalency between K3-EDTA plasma, K3-EDTA whole blood and K2-
EDTA whole blood was established in a separate matrix equivalency study.

Though significant deviations were observed in S1 and S2 samples, these high concentrations
are well outside the assay’s claimed measuring range. A regression analysis was also
performed with the best fit line having a slope of 0.994 and an intercept of 0.0 ng/ml. The
data was found to be linear across the measuring range of the assay (20-600 ng/mL). The
percent deviation from expected PSP concentration was found to be within ±10% for all the
samples between the established measuring range (20-600 ng/mL).
3. High Dose Hook Effect
A high-dose hook effect study was conducted by evaluating samples spiked at three PSP
concentrations: 10,000 ng/mL, 5,000 ng/mL, and 250 ng/mL. Test results for samples
containing 5,000 ng/mL and 10,000 ng/mL indicated a PSP concentration that is above the
upper limit of the assay reportable range. Thus, no hook effect was observed for the IVD
CAPSULE PSP assay at high levels of PSP.
4. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To evaluate potential interference effects on the IVD CAPSULE PSP from both endogenous and
exogenous substances, eight endogenous serum substances and 29 exogenous substances were
evaluated. Testing utilized a total of six reagent lots and included four operators across five
devices. A substance was considered a potential interferent if the mean percent recovery of PSP
in the spiked sample compared to the control sample was greater or lesser than ±10%.
To test the endogenous and exogenous substances, three K3-EDTA anticoagulated plasma pools
were prepared containing low, moderate, and high concentrations of PSP (51 ng/mL, 187 ng/mL,
and 334 ng/mL, respectively). Aliquots of each plasma pool was prepared then stored at -80°C
until use. Each exogenous substance was diluted in an appropriate diluent (ultrapure water,
ethanol or DMSO) then spiked at the appropriate test concentration into a low, moderate, and
high PSP plasma pool. Each pool was evaluated in replicates of 13 and compared to results from
the control samples prepared with the corresponding diluent only.

During the initial interference testing, a bias of more than 10% was observed for Fentanyl (30.0
µg/dL) and total protein (15.0 g/dL). Therefore, additional interference testing was conducted by
evaluating serially diluted dose response of the interferants (n=10 replicates). No interference
was observed for Fentanyl at concentrations ≤ 7.50 µg/dL and total protein ≤ 7.13 g/dL.

5. Assay Reportable Range:
The measuring range of the IVD CAPSULE PSP test is between 20 and 600 ng/mL of PSP.
Assay results are intended to be interpreted with respect to three different risk bands for
sepsis: decreased risk (<100 ng/mL PSP), slightly increased risk (100-299 ng/mL PSP), and
increased risk (≥ 300 ng/mL PSP).
6. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Calibrator Traceability:
An international standard or reference material for PSP is not available. IVD CAPSULE PSP
is calibrated by the manufacturer using a purified preparation of recombinant human PSP
(purified from Pichia pastoris culture by HPLC cation exchange and gel filtration
chromatography) based on the mass (concentration) of the analyte present in K3-EDTA
anticoagulated venous whole blood matrix. Each batch of IVD CAPSULE PSP is calibrated
using a weighted 5 parameter logistic curve fit data reduction method. The instrument
automatically reads in the batch-specific calibration data that are embedded within the
capsule’s chip, eliminating the need for calibration by the user. PSP Values assigned to the
calibration materials are directly traceable to the master batch of calibrator (i.e., the primary
reference material).
Quality Controls:
The IVD CAPSULE Control PSP is a single use kit consisting of a control solution vial that
contains a known concentration of PSP that is used to perform a quality control of the IVD
CAPSULE PSP on the abioSCOPE device and ensuring the accurate quantification of PSP
by the user. The acceptable measurement range of the IVD CAPSULE Control PSP is
indicated on the label of the primary packaging. The measured value of the abioSCOPE is
compared to the lower and upper range limits. If the value is within the acceptable range, the
result is displayed as “passed”. If the control result is outside of the acceptable range, the
result will be displayed as “failed”, indicating that the test was not performed properly, or
that the test reagents are not functioning properly, or that the abioSCOPE test system is not
working properly. Laboratories should follow applicable regulations and guidelines regarding
quality control testing frequency.
The abioSCOPE Control is a quality control capsule developed with the objective of ensuring
adequate performance of the abioSCOPE instrument. The abioSCOPE Control is a capsule
similar to the IVD CAPSULE PSP test except that it is provided closed and with all
components already integrated within the capsule. As a self-contained capsule, the
abioSCOPE Control can be re-used several times up to a limit indicated on the capsule and
programmed in the RFID tag or until its expiration (also programmed in the RFID tag)
whichever comes first.
Specimen Stability:
A specimen stability study was conducted to identify appropriate handling conditions for the
blood samples before testing with the IVD CAPSULE PSP assay. Three unique K2-EDTA
whole blood specimens were collected from healthy donors. Two specimens were spiked
with recombinant PSP to obtain PSP concentrations around 200 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL while
the PSP concentration of the third sample was approximately 80 ng/mL. Single-use aliquots
were prepared and stored at 30°C to mimic ambient temperature conditions. The samples
K240041 - Page 11 of 23

--- Page 12 ---
were tested in duplicates using one lot of IVD CAPSULE PSP and three abioSCOPE 2.0
devices at 0 hr, 1 hr, 4 hr, 5 hr, 8 hr, 21 hr, 24 hr and 26 hr time points.

Percent recovery (%RE) at each time point was computed from the baseline value at T0. A
linear regression analysis of %RE versus time was then conducted, and the slope of
regression line evaluated for significance. If the slope was found to be statistically significant
(i.e., different from 0 with p<0.05), then the stability claim would be based on the
intersection of the 95% confidence interval of the curve with the acceptance limits (percent
recoveries of either 90% or 110%). Otherwise, the stability claim would be the penultimate
time point evaluated in the study. No significant slope was observed in the regression
analysis indicating no significant deterioration of analyte stability over the measured interval.
Thus, the data supports a stability claim of 24 hr at ambient temperature for whole blood
specimens. Equivalency between K2-EDTA and K3-EDTA whole blood specimen types was
established in a matrix equivalency study.
7. Detection Limit:
Limit of blank:
To identify the limit of blank for IVD CAPSULE PSP, K3-EDTA whole blood samples from
four healthy donors was collected, homogenized, and centrifuged as per the supplier’s
recommendations. Red blood cells were then discarded to collect the K3-EDTA
anticoagulated plasma fraction. At least 2 ml of each sample were then PSP-immunodepleted
and respectively renamed PS0.1, PS0.2, PS0.3 and PS0.4. After depletion, the PSP
concentration of each plasma sample was determined by using an ELISA method. The
plasma samples were supplemented with red blood cells to a hematocrit level of 38% (v/v)
and analyzed with the IVD CAPSULE PSP assay in duplicate. Measurements were also
taken for samples without red blood cells. PSP concentrations were found less than 0.1 ng/ml
(undetectable) for the four samples in both sample types, confirming the successful removal
of endogenous PSP to an acceptable level.
Thereafter, the samples were tested for 3 days, 5 replicates per day, using 2 lots of IVD
CAPSULE PSP, yielding a total of 120 measurements. the rank position corresponding to the
95th percentile for the distribution of blank samples was determined as the highest LoB value

from the two lots tested rounded up to the closed single digit number. Based on the study
results, the LoB of the IVD CAPSULE PSP was identified as 2.6 ng/mL of PSP.
Limit of detection:
Five K3-EDTA plasma samples containing low concentrations of PSP supplemented with red
blood cells to reach a 38% hematocrit level (v/v) were tested for 3 days, 5 replicates per day,
on the abioSCOPE using two lots of IVD CAPSULE PSP. Among the 160 results, ten were
excluded as invalid due to a human error (the wrong lot of IVD CAPSULE PSP was used).
The limit of detection for the IVD CAPSULE PSP assay was calculated based on the
remaining 150 valid results following a parametric analysis approach. The highest LoD value
between the two lots tested was considered and rounded up to the closed single digit number.
Thus, the LoD of the IVD CAPSULE PSP assay was calculated as 9.4 ng/mL.
Limit of quantitation:
Two K3-EDTA anticoagulated PSP-immunodepleted (‘blank’) plasma lots were spiked with
recombinant PSP to five levels spanning a concentration range of 12 to 23 ng/mL. The ten
spiked panels were supplemented with red blood cells to reach a 38% hematocrit level (v/v)
and were run in replicates of five, with one run per day, for five days, using three lots of IVD
CAPSULE PSP, and two calibrator lots across two analyzers.
As the IVD CAPSULE PSP lots were calibrated with two batches of calibrators, two sets of
calibration parameters were available: the results obtained during the study were back-
calculated directly by the abioSCOPE 2.0 onto calibration parameters of the first lot of
calibrator. For the other lot, the raw data of the measurements were extracted from the
abioSCOPE and back calculated using the parameters of the calibration fit. The mean PSP
concentrations and imprecision (%CV) were computed for each PSP concentration level and
per lots of IVD CAPSULE PSP. The %CV were then plotted against the mean PSP
concentrations with a fitted line to determine the PSP concentration where the upper 95%
confidence level crosses the %CV = 20 limit. As described in the CLSI guideline EP17-A2,
the LoQ of the IVD CAPSULE PSP was determined as the highest % CV among the three
reagent lots, which is 17 ng/mL.
8. Assay Cut-Off:
See section VII.D Clinical Cut-off below.
9. Carry-Over:
Samples containing two different PSP concentrations (Low: approximately 100 ng/mL; High:
approximately 450 ng/mL) were prepared by spiking human recombinant PSP in PSP-
depleted K3-EDTA anticoagulated plasma. The samples were tested on a single IVD
CAPSULE PSP lot and on 3 different abioSCOPE devices. For each abioSCOPE instrument,
the first run was performed where both doses were measured one after the other in 10
consecutive replicates. Then, a second run was performed where both doses were re-
measured in 10 replicates in an alternating manner to detect potential sample carryover
issues. All measurements on each abioSCOPE were performed by the same operator and on
the same day. The test measurement procedure followed the instructions for use of the IVD
CAPSULE PSP product and the abioSCOPE 2.0.

For both runs evaluated, no significant difference was observed in PSP measurements for
either the high or low PSP specimens. These data support that no carry over occurs in the
abioSCOPE instrument with the IVD CAPSULE PSP assay cartridges.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not applicable.
2. Matrix Comparison:
A study was conducted to establish equivalent performance of IVD CAPSULE PSP assay
with venous K2-EDTA whole blood, K3-EDTA whole blood and K3-EDTA plasma
specimen types. This study supported the use of alternative sample matrices in some
analytical studies. Fifty-one unique matched venous K2-EDTA and K3-EDTA whole blood
specimens were collected for this study. An aliquot of each K3-EDTA whole blood specimen
was also used to isolate matched K3-EDTA plasma specimens. The samples from each donor
were tested in duplicates on the same day as the respective blood collections using one lot of
IVD CAPSULE PSP reagents and three abioSCOPE 2.0 devices.

Figure 1: Regression analysis Scatter plot for different matrices in comparison to
venous K2-EDTA whole blood
Potential differences in assay measurements across different matrices were assessed by
Passing/Bablok regression analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficient for K3-EDTA whole
blood when compared to K2-EDTA whole blood was 0.92 with a slope of 1.0 (95% CI:
0.92-1.17) and intercept of 0.68 (95% CI: -16.73 – 12.99). The Pearson correlation
coefficient of K3-EDTA plasma when compared to K2-EDTA whole blood was 0.91 with a
slope of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.84-1.16) and intercept of 26.6 (95% CI: -10.73 – 54.82).
Another study was conducted to establish equivalent performance of IVD CAPSULE PSP
assay for both venous and arterial K2-EDTA whole blood sample types. Matched venous and
arterial K2-EDTA whole blood sample pairs were collected from 33 patients. The samples
from each donor were tested in triplicate using one lot of IVD CAPSULE PSP and four
abioSCOPE 2.0 devices. The Pearson correlation coefficient for arterial K3-EDTA whole
blood was found to be 0.99 (slope = 1.04 (95% CI: 0.98-1.14); Intercept = 0.33 (95% CI: -
11.82 – 8.59)) in comparison to venous K3-EDTA whole blood.
Overall, the data from the matrix equivalency studies was found acceptable to support
equivalent performance of claimed sample types (i.e., use of venous and arterial K2-EDTA
anticoagulant whole blood samples and venous K3-EDTA anticoagulant whole blood
samples).
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the IVD CAPSULE PSP assay was evaluated in a multicenter,
blinded, observational, prospective clinical study (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier:
NCT04105699) across 6 different sites in the U.S. The primary objective of this study was to
validate the ability of the IVD CAPSULE PSP assay when performed on the first day of a
participant’s ICU admission to correctly identify those with sepsis, manifesting within the
first three days of testing. For the comparator, patients were identified as having sepsis based
on external independent review committee (EIRC) assessment (i.e., physician adjudication).
In this analysis, experts were blinded to procalcitonin (PCT) values.

A total of 497 patients admitted to the ICU were enrolled in the study based on the following
inclusion and exclusion criteria:
Study inclusion criteria were as follows:
1. Provision and understanding of signed and dated written informed consent by patient
or legally designated representative prior to any mandatory study-specific procedures,
sample collection, or analysis.
2. Male or female, aged ≥ 18 years
3. Admitted to ICU on the day of screening, with expectation that patient will require
ICU management for a minimum of 24 hours.
Study exclusion criteria were as follows:
1. Expected to die within 24 hours no matter what therapy is given, from the time of
screening.
2. Suffering on ICU admission or study entry from or known acute or chronic
pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer.
3. Admitted to ICU due to elective cardiac surgery with an uncomplicated stay
anticipated.
4. Patients having a valid Do Not Resuscitate order.
5. Previous ICU admission during this hospital stay.
6. Confirmed COVID-19 as reason for ICU admission.
Tables 8 and 9 below summarize the subject demographics of the study population (N =
497). Of the 497 subjects in the study, 220 (44.3%%) were females and 277 (55.7%) were
males. The mean age of subjects was 59.7±16.38 and ranged between 18 and 100 years. Most
subjects were white (83.3%), followed by black or African American (11.3%). The most
common reason for ICU admission was observed to be respiratory failure (16.3%). Based on
the comparator of physician adjudication, 241 (48.5%) of subjects were diagnosed with
sepsis. Age, sex and race were comparable between those adjudicated with sepsis and those
without sepsis.

The clinical study results indicate a statistically significant association between the IVD
CAPSULE PSP assay result and the increasing probability of sepsis across each PSP
concentration bin. The Likelihood Ratios (LR) in were calculated using the standard
definition where LR equals the probability that an individual at risk of developing sepsis has
the test result divided by the probability that an individual without the risk of developing
sepsis has the test result. This formula was applied to each PSP concentration bin separately.
The predictive values of IVD CAPSULE PSP test results depend upon the prevalence of
sepsis in the patient population. Laboratories and other users should establish their own

7. Clinical Specificity:
See Section VII.C Clinical Sensitivity above.
8. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
A generally healthy adult population including 211 subjects representative of the U.S.
demographics was enrolled in a study to determine the reference range interval of PSP values
measured using the IVD CAPSULE PSP assay(Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04409561
and NCT05849935). The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the prospective study are listed
below:
Study inclusion criteria were as follows:
1. Male or female, aged ≥ 18 years.
2. Apparently healthy as determined by a subject questionnaire.
Note: there were no special preanalytical factors to consider before the study
procedure (i.e., no need of fasting or rest period before sample collection).
Study exclusion criteria were as follows:
1. Current diagnosis, or history, of any underlying major medical condition determined
by the investigator, including but not limited to:
a. renal disease
b. Stroke
c. Liver disease
d. Pancreatic disease (including diabetes)
e. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder
f. Hypercalcitoninemia
g. HIV AIDS
h. Receiving antibiotic therapy
i. Suspected infection
j. Immunosuppression
k. Heart disease
l. Heart failure
m. Bleeding disorders
2. Underwent procedures related to sepsis, or diagnosed with sepsis, within the last 12
months
3. Current diagnosis of uncontrolled:
a. Hypertension,
b. Hypotension, or
c. Diabetes
4. Diagnosis of bacterial, fungal, or malaria infection within the last 3 months that
required antimicrobial treatment
5. Experienced severe trauma, surgery, cardiac arrest, or severe burn within the previous
3 months requiring medical care
6. Diagnosis of cancer within the last 12 months
7. Received immunotherapy to stimulate or inhibit cytokines within the last 12 months
8. Hospitalization for more than 24 hours within the last 1-3 months
K240041 - Page 19 of 23

--- Page 20 ---
9. Reported as currently pregnant or nursing a child
10. Unable or unwilling to provide the required blood sample for testing
11. Any other criteria that, in the opinion of the investigator, would render the participant
unsuitable for inclusion in the trial. For instance, if the investigator did not consider
the patient as relatively healthy.

*Subjects could report more than one race so numbers may be greater than the total.
According to the CLSI guideline EP28, lower limit of the reference interval corresponds to
the 2.5th percentile and the upper limit corresponds to the 97.5th percentile. The reference
interval for the PSP concentration in blood samples of generally healthy adults representative
of the U.S. population was found to be 28.7 ng/mL (90% CI: 25.8 - 31.9) and the upper limit
of the reference interval was found to be 228.3 ng/mL (90% CI: 204.7 - 255.4), with mean
and median values of 96.8 ng/mL and 81.0 ng/mL, respectively.
Overall, PSP values exhibited a variability of less than 10% across different ethnicities and
genders, suggesting that these factors did not significantly contribute to differences between
subgroups. However, when considering age, PSP values were higher in the 60+ age group
compared to the younger age group (median PSP value ≥ 60 Years of Age: 93.5 ng/ml vs
Median PSP value < 60 Years of Age: 69.0 ng/ml).
