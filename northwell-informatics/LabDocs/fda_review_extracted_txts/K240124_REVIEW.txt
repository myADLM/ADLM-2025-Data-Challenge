A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
BioSieve™ Fentanyl FIA Test Kit is a fluorescence immunoassay (FIA) for the qualitative
determination of fentanyl in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 1.0 ng/mL. The assay is
intended for use with BioSieve™ ToxiSmart FIA Reader.
It is for in vitro diagnostic use only. It is intended for prescription use.
The tests provide only preliminary results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be
used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
(GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug test result,
particularly when the preliminary test result is positive.
BioSieve™ ToxiSmart FIA Reader is a portable fluorescence instrument for in vitro diagnostic
use only. The Reader is designed to perform in vitro diagnostic tests on urine specimens. This
Reader can be used in a laboratory or in a point-of-care setting.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Strips are not for visual read.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
BioSieve™ ToxiSmart FIA Reader
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The assay consists of a test strip enclosed in a plastic cassette, a dropper, the BioSieve ToxiSmart
FIA Reader, and associated labeling. External quality control materials are recommended but not
included.
B Principle of Operation:
The BioSieve™ Fentanyl FIA Test Kit uses the principle of competitive and fluorescence
immunochromatography. The nitrocellulose membrane test area (T) of the test strip is coated
K240124 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
with fentanyl-bovine serum albumin conjugate, and the quality control area (C) is coated with
goat anti-rabbit lgG polyclonal antibody. Both Fentanyl monoclonal antibody and rabbit lgG
polyclonal antibody labeled with fluorescent microspheres are embedded on the conjugate pad.
The labeled antibody will flow forward with the sample when the urine sample is applied to the
sample well of the test device. When the concentration of fentanyl in the sample is higher than or
equal to the cut-off of the product, it will compete with the corresponding conjugate coated on
the test area (T) to bind to the fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody. Thus, fluorescence
signal rendering of the test line is inhibited and the result is positive. If the sample does not
contain fentanyl or its concentration is lower than the cut-off of the product, the corresponding
conjugate on the test line reacts with sufficient fluorescently-labeled monoclonal antibodies.
Thus, the test line will develop a fluorescence signal and the result is negative. The quality
control area (C) will also develop a fluorescence signal, indicating that the testing has been
performed correctly.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
BioSieve ToxiSmart FIA Reader
2. Specimen Identification:
Sample identification numbers must be entered manually by the user.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen collection, preparation, and handling conditions are described in the package insert
of the assay.
4. Calibration:
The analyzer is factory calibrated and does not need to be recalibrated by the operator.
5. Quality Control:
Quality control materials are recommended but not provided.
6. Operation Instruction:
BioSieve ToxiSmart FIA Reader provides two test modes: Standard and Quick.
Before the start of each mode, the reagent ID chip is inserted and the operator selects the
sample type and test item. The test card is then removed from the protective pouch and
placed on a horizontal flat surface.
• Under the standard test mode, the sample is dropped into a sample well using the
provided dropper. The test card with the sample is then placed into the instrument and
the operator starts the test by pressing the “Start test” button on the instrument which
K240124 - Page 3 of 11

--- Page 4 ---
automatically starts a timer. At the end of the incubation period, the instrument will
record the test results and the result will be available for reading and printing to the
operator.
• Under the quick test mode, the sample is dropped into a sample well using the
provided dropper. The test card with the sample is kept on a flat surface outside of the
instrument and manually incubated using a timer. At the end of the incubation period,
the test card with the patient sample is inserted into the instrument and the operator
starts the test by pressing the “Start test” button on the instrument. The instrument
will record the test results and the result will be available for reading and printing to
the operator.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cutoff, -75%
cutoff, -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff, cutoff, +25% cutoff, +50% cutoff, +75% cutoff and +100%
cutoff for fentanyl cut off concentration of 1 ng/mL. Samples with concentration of -100%
cutoff were drug-free urines samples. Other samples were prepared by spiking target drug
fentanyl in drug-free urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC-MS/MS.
All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples but didn’t
take part in the sample testing. A sequential randomization algorithm was applied to assign
the prepared samples to an arbitrary number.
The precision data was collected using three lots of reagent, three analyzers, and three sites,
with one replicate per run per lot, with two runs per day collected over 10 days.
Each study site has at least one test operator to perform the test. There are six tests per day
per concentration at each site (2 runs per day × 3 lots × 9 concentrations) for a total 54 tests
per day per site. Results are summarized in the table below:

2. Linearity:
Not applicable, this device is intended for qualitative use only
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Specificity Using Drug Free Samples:
The sponsor performed a specificity study to demonstrate negative results on drug-free
samples using the BioSieve™ Fentanyl FIA Test Kit. In the study, 30 drug-free urine
samples were collected. The concentration of these samples were tested and confirmed by
LC-MS. The test was performed using three (3) analyzers, three (3) lots and three (3)
operators. All tested samples had the expected negative result.
Cross Reactivity:
The sponsor performed a study to verify potential cross-reactants using the target drug, drug
metabolites and other related compounds.
Target drugs, drug metabolites and other components that are likely to interfere in urine
samples were added to drug-free urine at different concentrations of compounds and tested
using three (3) different instruments, three (3) different lots, and three (3) operators. The
lowest concentration that caused a positive result for each compound are listed below.
Percent cross reactivity of a compound is calculated by dividing the cutoff concentration by
the minimum concentration required to obtain a positive result and then multiplying by
100%. The results are listed in the table below:

Interference:
1. Interference Study on the Effect of Specific Gravity and pH:
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples with
specific gravity of 1.000 to 1.035 and urine samples with a pH of 4 to 9, in 1 pH unit
increments, were spiked with target fentanyl at 50% below and 50% above cutoff
levels. These samples were tested using three (3) lots of device, three (3) instruments
and three (3) different operators. Results were all positive for samples at +50% cutoff
and all negative for samples at and below -50% cutoff. The results demonstrate that
varying ranges of specific gravity and pH do not interfere with the BioSieve™
Fentanyl Test Kit (FIA).
2. Interfering Substances
Potential interfering substances found in human urine of physiological or pathological
conditions were added at a concentration of 100 μg/mL or as specified in the table
below.
The potential interferents were added to drug-free urine spiked with fentanyl to
concentrations at 50% below and 50% above cutoff levels. These urine samples were

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A comparison study between BioSieve™ Fentanyl Test Kit (FIA) and LC-MS/MS method
was conducted in three different testing sites including two POC sites (physician’s offices).
This study was a randomized and blinded accuracy study.
Clinical samples included a total of 80 urine samples (40 Negative and 40 positive). The
clinical samples were labeled using randomized numbers by the person who prepares
samples and did not perform the actual testing. Sample concentrations of fentanyl were
confirmed by LC-MS/MS prior to testing on the candidate device.
The study was performed using three reagent lots and three analyzers, and by three operators.
