III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access EPO assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of erythropoietin levels in human serum and plasma (heparin) using
the Access Immunoassay Systems. This assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of anemias
and polycythemias.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (K221225)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Access EPO assay consists of the reagent pack and calibrators. The reagent pack consists of
three specific reagents:
• Paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-mouse IgG: mouse anti-recombinant human
EPO monoclonal antibody, bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% sodium azide and 0.17%
ProClin 300.
• Chicken anti-recombinant mouse EPO alkaline phosphatase (bovine) conjugate, BSA, 0.1%
sodium azide and 0.17% ProClin 300.
• TRIS saline buffer containing BSA, proteins (chicken, bovine, mouse), <0.1% sodium azide
and 0.17% ProClin 300.
Each Access EPO reagent kit contains two packs, 50 tests per pack, for one hundred assay
determinations.
Other items needed but not supplied with reagent kit include:
Access EPO Calibrators: at zero and approximately 5, 25, 125, 375 and 750 mIU/mL
Quality Control (QC) materials: commercial control material
Substrate: Lumi-Phos PRO
UniCel DxI Wash Buffer II
Access Sample Diluent A (optional)
K240182 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
The modification of the Access EPO assay includes:
• to replace the substrate (Lumi-Phos 5530) of the Access EPO with a new substrate (Lumi-
Phos PRO) and
• to run the assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access EPO assay is a two-step “sandwich” assay, where a sample is added to a reaction
vessel along with the paramagnetic particles coated with mouse monoclonal anti-EPO, blocking
reagent and the alkaline phosphatase conjugate. After incubation, materials bound to the solid
phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate is added to the reaction vessel and light generated by the reaction is
measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration
of the analyte in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically determined from a stored
calibration.

All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a. Within-Laboratory Precision
Precision studies were performed at a single site on three DxI 9000 Immunoassay
analyzers using three reagent lots and three calibrator lots based on CLSI EP 05-A3. Five
samples were run in duplicate, two runs per day over 20 or more days. The five samples
tested were one sample pool of native and stripped serum sample, two samples were a
pool of native serum samples, and two samples were a pool of serum spiked with purified
EPO antigen. Repeatability (within-run), between-run, between-day, between-
lot/instrument and within-laboratory were evaluated. The mean (mIU/mL), standard
deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation (%CV) are summarized below.

b. Instrument-to-Instrument Reproducibility
Reproducibility was performed based on CLSI EP05-A3. Five samples at different
concentrations were run on three analyzers across three reagent lots and one calibrator lot
on each instrument with five replicates per run and one run per day over five days. The
five samples were prepared as follows: Sample 1 is a pool of two individual native serum
samples and one ultrafiltered sample, Sample 2 is a pool of two individual native serum
samples of similar concentration, Sample 3 is a pool of individual native serum samples,
Sample 4 and Sample 5 are both a pool of two individual native serum samples
supplemented with purified recombinant human EPO antigen. The data was used to
calculate between-run, between-day, between-lot, between-instrument, and
reproducibility (total precision). The mean (mIU/mL), standard deviation (SD) and
percent coefficient of variation (%CV) are summarized below.

native samples at additional concentrations spanning the assay analytical measuring
range. A panel of three individual native serum samples, a native serum pool of
individual samples of similar concentrations (sample 4) and a native serum pool
supplemented with EPO antigen (sample 5) were tested. The study was run on three

c. Lot-to-lot Calibrator Precision
The study was performed with a panel of three native serum samples at concentrations
spanning the Access EPO analytical measuring range. All samples were tested on one
DxI 9000 instrument, across three Access EPO calibrator lots, and one Access EPO
reagent lot. Three calibrations were performed on each calibrator lot. Each sample was
tested in replicates of two per run with two runs per day over 15 days. Three quality
controls were run in duplicate on each day to ensure systems were in control.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was performed based on CLSI EP06, 2nd Edition. A low sample was
obtained from a single native sample that was specifically depleted of EPO antigen using
paramagnetic particles. A high sample consisting of a pool of seven native serum samples
with similar concentration was prepared to represent the upper end of the measuring interval.
A panel of seven samples were prepared using the high and low samples. The low sample
was run in replicates of eight, all other samples were run in replicates of four. The study was
run on one analyzer using one reagent lot and one calibrator lot. Three quality controls were
run in replicates of two.
An additional verification study was performed to evaluate linearity of the low end of the
measuring range. A low sample was obtained from a single native sample that was
specifically depleted of EPO antigen using paramagnetic particles. A high individual native
sample at a concentration of approximately 100 mIU/mL was also acquired. Eight samples
were prepared for testing. The low sample was run in replicates of eight, all other samples
were run in replicated of four.
Linearity was established for the analytical measuring interval of 0.6–750 mIU/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Refer to K052223.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
0.6–750 mIU/mL
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability and stability of Access EPO were established in K052223.
The shelf-life claims and on-board (DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay analyzer) stability claims
of Lumi-Phos PRO substrate were established in K221225.

6. Detection Limit:
CLSI guideline EP17-A2 was followed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of
Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the Access EPO.
LoB: Samples were run on two analyzers with two reagent lots and one calibrator lot. Five
unique individual native serum samples from which EPO antigen was depleted using
paramagnetic particles were tested over three days, one run per day, five replicates per run,
for each pack lot. Three QC samples in replicates of two were run each day. The LoB was
calculated for each reagent lot based on a non-parametric approach. The claimed LoB for the
Access EPO assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay analyzer is 0.6 mIU/mL.
LoD: Samples were run on three analyzers with three reagent lots and one calibrator lot. Six
serum samples containing low levels of EPO analyte were tested over five days with one run
per day and nine replicates per run for each pack lot. The claimed LoD for the Access EPO
assay on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer in 0.6 mIU/mL.
LoQ: Samples were run on three analyzers with three reagent lots and one calibrator lot.
Thirteen serum samples containing low levels of EPO analyte were measured. Samples were
testing in replicates of nine per run with one run per day and five total days on each pack lot
and instrument. The claimed LoQ for the Access EPO assay on DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.6 mIU/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison study was performed to compare the Access EPO assay on the DxI
9000 Immunoassay analyzer to the predicate device, the Access EPO assay on the Access 2
Immunoassay System. A total of 152 samples were evaluated, of which 133 were native
serum samples, 8 were pools of native serum samples, and 11 were native serum samples
supplemented with EPO antigen. The study was run on three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
analyzers and three Access 2 analyzers with three reagent pack lots and three calibrator lots.
Two commercial quality controls were run in duplicate each day. The comparison between
paired measurements was analyzed using Passing-Bablok method. The study met pre-defined
acceptance criteria.
