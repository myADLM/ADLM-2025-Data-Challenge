B Principle of Operation:
The candidate device, “OmniTrans Transport System,” is intended for the collection and transport of
clinical specimens containing viruses, chlamydiae, mycoplasma or ureaplasma from the collection
site to the testing laboratory. The device contains the OmniTrans Transport Medium that is packaged
alone or with swabs. Each of the swabs may be used for specimen collection from different anatomical
locations. Use of the OmniTrans Transport System is by prescription only, and sample collection is
intended to be performed by health care professionals only. Following collection, the specimen is
placed into a Transport Medium tube. The candidate device is designed for storage of specimens in
the cold (2–8℃) or at controlled room temperatures (20–25℃) for up to 48h. The medium is non-
toxic to mammalian host cells or cell lines commonly used for culturing the virus and chlamydiae
tested. The system carrying the specimen can be processed using standard clinical laboratory
operating procedures for culture of clinical specimens.

6. Shelf-life Stability:
Stability studies were performed in real time with OmniTrans Transport Medium to determine if any
quality changes of the transport media occur when stored for extended periods under specified storage
conditions (i.e., 2–25oC). At both cold (2–8oC) and controlled room temperature (20–25oC), transport
media stability was assessed with serial evaluation of physical, physicochemical, and microbiological
characteristics (e.g., medium appearance, net volumetric content; pH; sterility of medium in tube) at
media lot production (i.e., time 0) and then at 6, 12, 18 months, and beyond. Further, microbial stasis
in medium was compared between a newly produced lot (age 2 months at test) and an older lot (age
>18 months at test).
A. Appearance, Net Volumetric Content, and pH:
Random tubes from three (3) medium lots were assessed qualitatively for appearance (color and
clarity) and quantitatively through estimation of net volumetric content and pH measurement at time
0 (i.e., 0–2 days after production at ambient temperatures, 20–25oC) and then serially at 6, 12, 18, and
>18 months following storage in the cold (2–8oC) or at controlled room temperatures (20–25oC).
Additionally, the results from the oldest lots (>18 months of age at test) were compared with those of
random tubes from a newly manufactured (day of production) lot. There was no appreciable change
in appearance, net volumetric content, or pH of the media in tubes at either temperature range. Further,
all pH measurements were within the predefined range (7.3 ± 0.2, i.e., pH 7.1–7.5). Therefore, the
predefined acceptance criteria for these physical and physicochemical characteristics were met during
storage of the OmniTrans Transport Media for up to 18 months under pre-set storage conditions.
B. Sterility assessment:
The OmniTrans Transport System is not claimed to be sterile nor is it intended to be sterilized by the
end user. To decrease the chances of contamination, the screw-capped tubes are separately sterilized
with electron beam (e-beam) radiation prior to aseptic filling with transport media under controlled
conditions. Using medium lots of serial post-production ages (0, 6, 12, 18, and >18 months), aseptic
status of transport media in tubes from these lots was confirmed by observation of no microbial
growth after 14 days of incubation of transport medium aliquots in fluid thioglycolate medium at 30–
35oC and trypticase soy broth at 20–25oC. The swabs provided with the OmniTrans Transport System
are individually packaged and are sold as sterile.
C. Cytotoxicity assessment:
The OmniTrans Transport Medium does not come into contact with patient tissue. However, at the
destination laboratory, the specimens transported in the medium may be placed in contact with
K240235 – Page 5 of 10

--- Page 6 ---
mammalian cell lines used for viral and chlamydial culture. Therefore, an in vitro cytotoxicity assay
was conducted for the transport medium with MRC-5, a human fetal lung fibroblast cell-line. Cell
viability under test conditions was >70% and the medium did not demonstrate appreciable cytopathic
effects on the assayed cells. The assay results were comparable between the oldest (age >18 months)
and a newly manufactured (1 month at test) medium lots.
D. Microbial stasis assessment:
Microbial stasis studies were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the antimicrobial components
of the OmniTrans Transport Medium. An old (>18 months at test) and a new (<3 months) lot of the
medium were tested with one type-culture each of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and
Candida albicans. Briefly, each microorganism strain was inoculated in the transport medium to a
final concentration of 105–106 CFU/mL, incubated at 37℃ for 0–48 hours, and plated for counting
on trypticase soy agar (for bacteria) or Sabouraud’s dextrose agar (for Candida albicans). The
OmniTrans Transport Medium had no increase in microbial counts under the test conditions at 48
hours, and both tested medium lots passed the criteria for microbial stasis.
Conclusions: The collective observations for medium characteristics (i.e., appearance, net volume,
pH, sterility in tube, and microbial stasis) in timed studies with variously aged lots support the claim
for 18 months of shelf-life stability for the transport medium when stored in the cold (2–8oC) and at
controlled room temperatures (20–25oC). Therefore, the shelf life of the OmniTrans Transport System
was determined to be 18 months from the date of manufacture when stored at temperatures 2–25°C.
7. Performance: Specimen Stability:
Viral and Bacterial recovery studies
Microorganism recovery studies in appropriate negative clinical matrices were conducted with
thirteen (13) different representative viruses and bacteria using the OmniTrans Transport Medium
lots of various post-production ages, including:
• Old (16–18, or >18 months at the time of use in tests),
• Middle-aged (age 9–10 months at test), and
• New, including <1 week (i.e., newly produced lot) to <3 months of age at test.
Table 1 below summarizes the specimen stability study methodologies and acceptance criteria used
for microbial recovery studies. Table 2 summarizes the negative clinical matrices used to demonstrate
the specimen stability. The contrived samples using negative clinical matrix for virus or bacteria in
OmniTrans Transport System were stored in the cold (2–8oC) or at room temperatures (20–25oC).
Microbial recovery studies used media from variously aged lots spanning the claimed shelf life. The
recovery study data are summarized in Tables 3–6 below.

Conclusions: The primary criterion for acceptance of recovery studies (as indicated in Table 1) was
pre-set at recovered numbers (Fluorescent Foci counts or CFUs, as applicable) being within 1 Log
10
(i.e., ±90%) of the enumeration at time 0. As observed in the recovery studies using OmniTrans
Transport Medium lots of post-production age up to 18 months, all the viral and bacterial recovery
counts at 48 hours satisfied this criterion. Therefore, during transport in the OmniTrans Transport
System when stored at 2–25oC, the specimen stability claim of microbial recovery for up to 48 hours
is acceptable.
