IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The test comes in three test formats (strip, cassette, and midstream) named HCG Home Use
Pregnancy Test Strip (Colloidal Gold), HCG Home Use Pregnancy Test Cassette (Colloidal
Gold) and HCG Home Use Pregnancy Test Midstream (Colloidal Gold), respectively. The test
strip format is packaged as a single test strip sealed in a desiccated aluminum pouch with
instructions for use. The midstream format is a test strip assembled in a plastic housing with an
absorbent tip and is packaged as a single test sealed in a desiccated aluminum pouch with
instructions for use. The cassette format is the test strip assembled in a plastic cassette and is
packaged as a single test with a dropper, a collection container, and instructions for use.
B Principle of Operation:
HCG Home Use Pregnancy Test Strip (Colloidal Gold), HCG Home Use Pregnancy Test
Cassette (Colloidal Gold) and HCG Home Use Pregnancy Test Midstream (Colloidal Gold) are
qualitative, lateral flow sandwich immunochromatographic assays for the in vitro detection of
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. Each test reagent strip consists of an anti-rat-α-
hCG monoclonal antibody coated test line on the nitrocellulose membrane and a dried glass fiber
membrane pad containing an anti-rat-β-hCG monoclonal antibody labeled with gold nanoparticle
conjugate. The control antibodies are goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody coated at the quality
control region on the nitrocellulose membrane.
To use the strip format of the test, the user dips the sample pad into urine collected in a collection
cup for at least 10 seconds. To use the cassette format, the user applies 3 full drops of urine
specimen to the specimen well on the cassette. To use the midstream format, the user applies a
specimen by keeping the absorbent tip in a urine midstream for at least five (5) seconds.
After application of the urine specimen, the test result is shown in the result window and read
visually after 5 minutes of urine application. Two distinct colored lines, one in the test zone and
another in the control zone indicate a positive test result (pregnant). Absence of a colored line in
the test zone and only a colored line in the control zone indicates a negative test result (not
pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the control zone, even in the presence of a colored line in
the test zone, indicates an invalid test result.

A lay user study was conducted at 3 sites with 300 volunteers with diverse educational and
occupational backgrounds who were between the age of 18 and 48. This included 100 lay
users using the HCG Home Use Pregnancy Test Cassette (Colloidal Gold) at site 1, 100 lay-
users using the HCG Home Use Pregnancy Test Strip (Colloidal Gold) at site 2, and 100 lay-
users using the HCG Home Use Pregnancy Test Midstream (Colloidal Gold) at site 3. Lay
users collected their own sample, and these samples were split into two groups, one group
was for the lay-user testing, and the other was for the professional testing. All samples were
masked and randomized prior to professional testing. Each lay user tested her own urine
sample with only one test method on the candidate device following the instructions on the
package insert. The same sample was tested by the professional using the predicate device.
Then the results of lay-user tests were compared to results reported by a laboratory
professional. The data shows that the agreement between lay-user results and professional
results was 100% (below):
