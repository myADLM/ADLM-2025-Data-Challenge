DxH 690T Coulter Cellular Analysis System
The DxH 690T Coulter Cellular Analysis System consists of a stand-alone tabletop DxH 690T
instrument with same detection capabilities, technology, software and analytes as the DxH 900
instrument. The DxH 690T cannot be configured as a workcell.
B Principle of Operation:
The UniCel DxH 900/DxH 690T Coulter Cellular Analysis System is based on the Coulter
Principle. The Coulter Principle accurately counts and sizes cells by detecting and measuring
changes in electrical resistance when a particle (such as a cell) in a conductive liquid passes
through a small aperture. Each cell suspended in a conductive liquid (diluent) acts as an
insulator. As each cell goes through the aperture, it momentarily increases the resistance of the
electrical path between the submerged electrodes on either side of the aperture. This causes a
measurable electronic pulse. For counting, the vacuum used to pull the diluted suspension of
cells through the aperture must be at a regulated volume. While the number of pulses indicates
particle count, the size of the electrical pulse is proportional to the cell volume. All pulses
generated by the apertures are collected and sent to the Signal Conditioner Analyzer Card for
analog to digital conversion. The process provides the following raw counts and digital
measurements to the System Manager for processing by the algorithms where the reported
parameter values, flags and histograms are generated.
The complete blood count (CBC) is the fundamental analytical test that evaluates the three main
cellular components: white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Sample preparation and
data collection occur in the Sample Aspiration Module (SAM) and Complete Blood Count
(CBC) modules on the UniCel DxH 900/DxH 690T Coulter Cellular Analysis System.
K240252 - Page 3 of 27

The lytic reagent for WBC is used to prepare the blood so the system can count leukocytes and
measure the amount of hemoglobin. The lytic reagent rapidly and simultaneously destroys the
erythrocytes and converts a substantial proportion of the hemoglobin to a stable pigment while it
leaves leukocyte nuclei intact. The absorbance of the pigment is directly proportional to the
hemoglobin concentration of the sample. Hemoglobin (HGB) is measured photometrically at 525
nm using the sample from the WBC analysis. A blank is introduced into the cuvette during each
operating cycle. The HGB blank provides a reference to which the sample signal is compared.
The COULTER VCSn technology is used to determine the white cell differential, nucleated red
blood cell and reticulocyte parameters along with associated flags, messages, histograms and
data plots. As the particles pass through the sensing zone, a diode laser illuminates the particles.
The flow cell measures volume, conductivity, multiple angles of light scatter, and axial light loss.
• For the WBC differential, sample preparation occurs at the Diff mix chamber where sample
and reagents are added in the following order: Diff Lyse, blood, additional Diff Lyse
followed by an air mix. Next, Diff preservative is added, followed by a second air mix, and
an incubation period. The prepared sample is transferred to the module where cells are
counted in an isometric sample stream. The algorithm separates the WBC into five major
populations.
• For NRBC, sample preparation occurs at the NRBC Diff mix chamber where sample and
reagents are added in the following order: Diluent, blood, additional Diluent followed by an
air mix. Next, DxH Cell Lyse is added, followed by a second air mix, and an incubation
period. The prepared sample is transferred to the module where cells are counted in an
isometric sample stream. The algorithm separates NRBC from WBC.
• Reticulocytes are immature, non-nucleated erythrocytes retaining a small network of
basophilic organelles, consisting of RNA and protoporphyrin. The enumeration of
reticulocytes provides a simple, effective means to determine red cell production and
regeneration. Reticulocyte immaturity is related to cell volume and light scatter. Since more
immature reticulocytes are larger, contain more RNA and cause increased light scatter, the
cell volume and light scatter will increase with immaturity of the cell.
The data collected during each of the analytical processes is transferred to the System Manager
where the digital raw values are processed by the algorithm using mathematical approaches
designed for finding optimal separation between clusters of data. The identified clusters are used
to calculate the frequency of cells within each population, generate parameter values, flags,
histograms and data plots.
The DxH Slidemaker Stainer II allows for adaptation of the smear appearance and stain
methodology. Blood smears produced by the Slidemaker portion of the DxH Slidemaker Stainer
II are moved to baskets for transfer to the Stainer portion by a robot for microscopic examination
of the stained blood smears.

Repeatability studies were performed at one testing site on the DxH 900−3S work cell
composed of three DxH 900 and one SMS II under repeatability mode using cassette
presentation and closed-vial sampling mode. Within run repeatability studies were performed
by using ten whole blood samples covering the analytical measuring interval (AMI) collected
in K2EDTA. Testing was performed randomly on one of the DxH 900 instrument of DxH
900−3S work cell. Within run imprecision (repeatability) was performed using ten
aspirations (replicates) of whole blood samples and replicate analysis of the specimens was
performed by using the Repeatability function. Control material was used for assaying

Reproducibility – Whole Blood
Reproducibility studies were performed at one testing site on one DxH 900−3S work cell
composed of three DxH 900 and one SMS II to evaluate the within-run, between-run,
between-day, between-instrument, and total reproducibility of the DxH 900. Testing was
performed using three levels of each whole blood control material (COULTER 6C Plus Cell
Control and COULTER Retic-X Cell Control). Each level was run in triplicates twice per
day per instrument with two hours apart for five days using a single lot of controls and
reagents across the three DxH 900−3S work cell. The mean, SD and CV% were reported for
each parameter and all parameters met the acceptance criteria. Results are summarized
below.

Body Fluid Studies
Method comparison studies were performed to assess the performance of the UniCel DxH
900 Coulter Cellular Analysis System to the predicate UniCel DxH 800 Coulter Cellular
Analysis System. The study was conducted at three sites with two sites using DxH 900
standalone instrument and one site using DxH 900−3 S. A total of 204 residual body fluid
samples (serous, synovial and diluted whole blood) collected from pediatric (≤21 years) and
adult subjects including a wide variety of disease states/clinical conditions were tested across
three clinical sites. Body fluids samples were stored at room temperature and tested in
random order on UniCel DxH 900 Coulter Cellular Analysis System and UniCel DxH 800
Coulter Cellular Analysis System within one hour of each other.
A Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed. Bias at medical decision points were
evaluated for all sites combined. All results were within the predefined acceptance criteria.
Overall, all body fluid tested on UniCel DxH 900 Coulter Analysis System demonstrated
comparable performance to the predicate device, UniCel DxH 800 Coulter Cellular Analysis
System.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Sensitivity study was conducted to evaluate the flagging capabilities of the UniCel DxH
900 Coulter Cellular Analysis System and compare with that of UniCel DxH 800 Coulter
Cellular Analysis System. The analysis was conducted using the flagging results from the
method comparison studies performed at three clinical sites, in accordance with CLSI H20-
A2 guideline. A total of 735 residual normal (no flags, marked as negative) and abnormal
(contained flags, marked as positive) whole blood samples were tested and compared to the
predicate. All the distributional cases described in CLSI H20-A2 including important
medical decision levels were analyzed for agreement analysis. The morphological
agreement was based on DxH 800 (predicate) flagging for immature granulocytes, variant
lymphocytes and left shift. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA), Negative Percent
Agreement (NPA) and Overall Percent Agreement (OPA) with the 95% confidence
intervals were calculated for all three sites combined.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Adult Whole Blood Reference Range
Studies to assess the adult reference range for whole blood samples were conducted on UniCel
DxH 900 Coulter Cellular Analysis System per CLSI EP28-A3c to verify the reference intervals
for male and female adults at one site. Forty whole-blood samples (male=20; female=20) were
collected in K2EDTA from normal donors and tested in one replicate on two standalone UniCel
DxH 900 Coulter Cellular Analysis Systems (DxH 900 instrument). The lower and upper limits
of the 95% reference intervals were determined based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of all
valid measurements for each sex group, respectively. 90% of the normal samples were within the
established reference ranges on the predicate device DxH 800. The data supports that the
