A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1) test is composed of two automated assays - VIDAS TBI
(GFAP) and VIDAS TBI (UCH-L1) - to be used on the VIDAS 3 instrument for the quantitative
measurement of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase
(UCH-L1) in human serum using the ELFA (Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay) technique. The
results of both assays are required to obtain an overall qualitative test interpretation.
The overall qualitative VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1) test result is used, in conjunction with
clinical information, to aid in the evaluation of patients (18 years of age or older), presenting
within 12 hours of suspected mild traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score 13-15), to
assist in determining the need for a Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the head. A negative
interpretation of VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1) test is associated with the absence of acute
intracranial lesions visualized on a head CT scan.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use
D Special Instrument Requirements:
VIDAS 3 instrument (K141133)
IV Device/System Characteristics:

specifications for assay calibration and concentration information of calibrator (S1) and control
(C1) for each assay.
Both assays are to be used on VIDAS 3 instrument.
B Principle of Operation:
The VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1) test is composed of two assays, VIDAS TBI (GFAP) and
VIDAS (UCH-L1). Each combines a three-step enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a
final fluorescent detection (ELFA). All the assay steps are performed automatically by the
VIDAS 3 instrument. The sample is transferred into the well containing sample diluent. The
sample/diluent mixture is cycled in and out of the Solid Phase Receptable (SPR) device several
times to allow the antigen (GFAP or UCH-L1) to bind with the immunoglobulins that are fixed
to the interior wall of the SPR device. The bounded complex is presented to antibodies labeled
with biotin (conjugate) to form a sandwich immunocomplex. For the third immunological step,
the complex is presented to anti-biotin antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase (tracer)
using the SPR and form the final immunological complex "Antibody-Analyte-Conjugate-
Tracer". Unbound tracer is eliminated during washing steps. During the final detection step, the
substrate (4-Methylumbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR device. The
conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-
umbelliferone), which is measured at 450 nm. The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to
the concentration of antigen in the sample. At the end of each assay, separate results of VIDAS
TBI (GFAP) and VIDAS TBI (UCH-L1) are automatically calculated by the instrument.
Final VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1) test interpretation is performed manually by the user. The
results interpretation is shown in the following table:
GFAP Assay Result UCH-L1 Assay Result VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1)
(relative to cut-off)A (relative to cut-off)B Interpretation
Negative Negative Negative
Negative, Invalid Positive Positive
Positive Negative, Invalid Positive
Positive Positive Positive
Invalid Negative Not ReportableC
Negative Invalid Not ReportableC
Invalid Invalid Not ReportableC
A “Positive” means the GFAP concentration is equal to or above the cut-off value of 22.0 pg/mL and “Negative”
means the GFAP concentration is below the cut-off value of 22.0 pg/mL.
B “Positive” means the UCH-L1 concentration is equal to or above the cut-off value of 327.0 pg/mL and “Negative”
means the UCH-L1 concentration is below the cut-off value of 327.0 pg/mL.
C Samples with “Invalid” results that yield a “Not Reportable” VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1) result may be
retested once to obtain a “Negative” or “Positive” result.

A positive clinical interpretation of VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1), in conjunction with clinical
assessment, can suggest and support the need for a head CT (Computed Tomography) scan. In
contrast, a negative clinical interpretation is associated with absence of acute intracranial lesions
visualized on a head CT scan.

A study was conducted per CLSI guideline EP05-A3 to evaluate the effects of site-to-site
variability. The same two sample panels evaluated in the within-laboratory precision
study were tested in triplicate, two runs per day with at least two hours between runs,
during five days in three different laboratories including two in the U.S. and one OUS.
One lot of the VIDAS TBI (GFAP) assay, one lot of the VIDAS TBI (UCH-L1) assay and
one VIDAS 3 instrument at each site was used. Combining all sites, a total of 90
replicates were obtained per panel member. The data were analyzed quantitively and
qualitatively. The results are summarized for each assay in the table below.

each assay. The High sample for each assay was generated by spiking positive serum sample
into a negative serum sample (for GFAP) or pools (for UCH-L1). The Low sample for each
assay was analyte depleted pooled serum. With the exception of the low concentration
sample pool, which was tested in eight replicates, all other sample pools in the dilution series
were tested in four replicates using two lots of each assay. The observed values were
evaluated against the expected values and weighted least squares linear regression was
performed. The %CV of the concentrations measured, the predicted values, deviations from
linearity, and % deviations from the regression line were calculated for each sample. The
results are summarized in the table below:
Test Range Slope Intercept
Assay Lot # R2 % Deviation
(pg/mL) (95% CI) (95% CI)
1.024 -0.716
GFAP 1 6.7 – 354.5 0.9988 -2.15 to 9.07%
[0.999; 1.050] [-1.722; 0.289]
1.023 -1.857
1 58.9 – 3034.0 0.9995 -6.23 to 1.72%
[1.006; 1.040] [-5.165; 1.452]
UCH-L1
0.980 6.818
2 40.2 – 2769.1 0.9990 -13.05 to 1.75%
[0.958; 1.002] [3.472; 10.164]
The study supports the linear range of 6.7–354.5 pg/mL for the GFAP assay and 58.9–2769.1
pg/mL for the UCH-L1 assay, with a deviation from linearity within 10% (except the Low
sample with the UCH-L1 value of 40.2 pg/mL has a deviation of -13.05% from linearity).
The results support the linearity throughout the reportable ranges of 10.0–320.0 pg/mL for
GFAP and 80.0 – 2560.0 pg/mL for UCH-LI.
Hook effect
The potential hook effect was evaluated. A serum sample spiked to a high antigen level was
used to prepare a dilution series with 12 samples. Each dilution was tested in triplicate for
each assay using one lot of VIDAS TBI (GFAP) and one lot of VIDAS TBI (UCH-L1) assay
on one VIDAS 3 instrument. No hook effect was observed for each assay using serum
samples with antigen concentrations exceeding 200,000 pg/mL GFAP and 400,000 pg/mL
UCH-L1, when tested on the VIDAS 3 instrument.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Studies to evaluate the analytical specificity/interference were conducted using at least one
lot of VIDAS TBI (GFAP) assay, one lot of VIDAS TBI (UCH-L1) assay and one VIDAS 3
instrument. Two levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 in pooled serum samples were evaluated in the
studies: low (17.0 ̶ 27.0 pg/mL) and high (180.0 ̶ 220.0 pg/mL) for GFAP, and low (300.0–
350.0 pg/mL) and high (1300.0–1700.0 pg/mL) for UCH-L1. The low GFAP and UCH-L1
level corresponds to the concentration close to the respective clinical decision threshold. The
high UCH-L1 serum sample was spiked with recombinant UCH-L1 to achieve the targeted
concentration.

Test samples were created by spiking the pooled serum samples with the potentially
interfering substances listed in the table below at test concentrations recommended in
CLSI EP37 Ed1. Control samples were spiked only with the appropriate solvent used to
prepare the stock solution of the potentially interfering substance. Each test and control
sample were evaluated with five to seven replicates in one assay run for each potentially
interfering substance. The %recovery was calculated by comparing measurements of the
test and control samples. A substance was identified as an interferent if the difference in
the means between the test and control samples was not within 10% of the control sample
mean for GFAP or UCH-L1. For any substances identified as an interferent at the initial
concentration tested, a dose response analysis was performed.

b. Cross-reactivity
For cross-reactivity, each potential cross-reacting substance was tested at a concentration
that corresponds to its highest reported physiological level reported in circulation
according to literature, as applicable, indicated in the table below. The effect of each
potential cross-reactant was evaluated by comparing the test results from a control
sample, spiked with the appropriate solvent used to create the stock solution of the
potential cross-reactant (Control Pool), with the test results from a sample spiked with the
potentially cross-reacting substance (Test Pool). Each test and control sample for each
potentially cross-reacting substance was evaluated with five replicates. The %recovery
was calculated by comparing measurements of the test and control samples. A substance
was identified as an interferent if the difference in the means between the test and control
samples was not within 10% of the control sample mean for GFAP or UCH-L1. None of
the tested cross-reacting substances were found to interfere with the VIDAS TBI (GFAP)
and VIDAS TBI (GFAP) assays.

outside of the reportable range.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a. Traceability
There are no internationally recognized reference standards for GFAP and UCH-L1.
Calibration of the VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1) assay is traceable to in-house reference
calibrators for each of the two proteins.
b. Kit Stability
Shelf-life stability: Reagent shelf-life of the VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1) was
determined on three VIDAS 3 instruments using three reagent lots of each assay. One kit
lot was exposed to a series of thermal shocks to simulate variations in temperature during
shipping. A panel of four pooled serum samples covering the respective AMIs of each
assay were tested. The mean value for each sample at T0, and sequent timepoints (3, 6, 9,
12 and 13 months) were determined in triplicate in three runs. The absolute and relative
recovery of the test samples with respect to the initial measurement at T0 was evaluated.
The results support that the VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1) is stable up to 8 months when
stored at 2–8°C.
In-use stability: Stability of the VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1) after first opening was
evaluated for kit components including SPR (storage pouch opened, then tightly closed),

Calibrator S1 and Control C1 (up to four cycles of successive opening and closing of the
vials) and the reagent kit (12 cycles of 70 minutes at 30°C ± 2°C). A panel of four pooled
serum samples covering the respective AMIs of each assay were tested in triplicate at test
timepoints. The results support the following in-use stability claims:
• SPRs were stable up to 8 months after first opening and stored at 2–8°C.
• Reagent kit was stable up to12 cycles of 70 minutes at 30°C and back to 2–8°C.
• Calibrator S1 and Control C1 were stable up to four cycles from 2–8°C to 25°C.
A study was also performed to determine the stability of each assay from storage at 2–
8°C or after subjecting to different temperature conditions before testing. The results
support that assay reagents could remain at 18–25°C for up to 4 hours before testing.
On-board stability: A study was performed to determine the stability of the reagents, i.e.,
SPR and strips, inside the VIDAS 3 instrument. A panel of four samples that includes
Calibrator S1, Control C1 and two samples, one with analyte concentration close to the
cut-off of the respective assay, was tested at the following time intervals using reagent
on-board: 0 min, 6 min ± 1, 22 min ± 1, and 32 min ± 2. The results support the stability
of the reagents in the VIDAS 3 instrument for up to 8 hours at 37°C and storage of
samples in the strip in the VIDAS 3 instrument up to 20 minutes at 37°C before assaying.
c. Sample Stability
A study was performed to evaluate the stability of fresh serum specimens in primary
tubes using one lot of the VIDAS TBI (GFAP) assay and one lot of the VIDAS TBI
(UCH-L1) assay on one VIDAS 3 instrument. Forty specimens with concentrations of
GFAP and UCH-L1 covering the respective assays were collected in serum tubes with
separator gel and coagulation activator SST II Advance (SST). All specimens were
centrifuged and then tested in duplicate with both assays at different timepoints under
storage conditions to mimic customer use. Passing and Bablok regression was used to
compare the result of the reference condition to the result of the other conditions. In
addition, stability of the sample under freeze/thaw cycles was also evaluated by testing 40
specimens collected in SST tubes using one lot of the VIDAS TBI (GFAP) assay and two
lots of the VIDAS TBI (UCH-L1) assay on two VIDAS 3 instruments.
The results support the sample is stable:
• up to three hours at 18–25°C after centrifugation
• up to 43 hours at 2–8°C in closed primary tubes
• for one free/thaw cycle (when stored at -19 to -31°C or -60°C for 5 months)
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI guideline EP17-A2. The studies evaluated
two lots of VIDAS TBI (GFAP) assay and two lots of VIDAS TBI (UCH-L1) assay on one
VIDAS 3 instrument.
K240279 - Page 15 of 24

--- Page 16 ---
For LoB, four blank samples corresponding to very low concentrations of native GFAP were
tested in duplicate over 8 days on one VIDAS 3 instrument using two reagent lots of the
VIDAS TBI (GFAP) assay. The five blank samples corresponding to very low
concentrations of native UCH-L1 were tested in duplicate over 8 days on one VIDAS 3
instrument using two reagent lots of the VIDAS TBI (UCH-L1) assay. The LoB was
evaluated for each lot of reagent and the final LoB was determined as the greater of the LoB
values obtained for each reagent lot for each assay.
For LoD, seven low-level of GFAP serum samples were tested in five replicates per day for
8 days using two lots of the VIDAS TBI (GFAP) assay on one VIDAS 3 instrument to
obtain 40 measurements for each sample, totaling 280 measurements per assay lot. The
sample protocol was used to test six low-level of UCH-L1 serum samples using two lots of
the VIDAS TBI (UCH-L1) assay, resulting a total of 240 measurements per assay lot. The
final LoD was determined as the greater of the LoD values obtained for each reagent lot for
each assay.
For LoQ, the data generated from the LoD study above was estimated based on the lowest
concentration quantifiable with an intermediate precision of ≤15% CV and ≥ LoD for each
assay.
The results are summarized in the table below:

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical Specificity:
The performance of the VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1) as an aid to assist physicians in
determining the need for a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was evaluated in two
studies: the first study used samples from the ALERT-TBI study, the second study used
samples from the BRAINI study.
Clinical study using samples from the ALERT-TBI study
The study was conducted by testing frozen serum specimens that were previously collected by
Banyan Biomarkers (San Diego, CA) from subjects participating in their prospective
multicenter study “A Prospective Clinical Evaluation of Biomarkers of Traumatic Brain
Injury” (ALERT-TBI, protocol ATO-06). This study enrolled subjects over the age of 18 who
presented to a health care facility (HCF) or emergency department (ED) with suspected head
injuries and had blood withdrawn within 12 hours of head injury. A total of 1911 frozen and
de-identified serum samples of the ALERT cohort were tested in singlicate at three clinical
sites (that include two in the U.S.) on the VIDAS 3 instrument, using three lots and two
calibrations per lot by operators representative of end-users of the VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-
L1) test. Each specimen was associated with a standard of care computed tomography (CT)
scan of the head from the same study subject. Under the ALERT-TBI study protocol, the CT
scans were independently reviewed by a panel of radiologists and a subject’s CT scan was

Of the 120 subjects with positive CT scan results, four had negative results from the VIDAS
TBI (GFAP UCH-L1) test. The rate of false negative (FN) results was 3.33% (4/120). None
of these four subjects were identified with a lesion requiring surgical intervention. Of the
1791 subjects with negative CT scan results, 738 had a negative VIDAS TBI (GFAP UCH-
L1) result (clinical specificity = 41.2%). The rate of False Positive (FP) results was 58.8%
(1053/1791). The Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the assay was 99.5% (738/742). The
results showed that the clinical performance of the VIDAS TBI (GFAP UCH-L1) test is
characterized by high clinical sensitivity and high NPV, comparable to that demonstrated by

There was little variation in NPV and PPV between males and females and with increasing
time from injury. However, the differences did not translate into statistically significant
differences in assay performance. The analysis by age shows that the clinical specificity is
lower in patients ≥ 65 years of age (13.8%) than in patients < 65 years of age (50.6%), and
conversely, the clinical sensitivity is higher in the older population (97.7% versus 96.1%),
respectively.
Clinical study using samples from the BRAINI study
A supplemental clinical validation of the GFAP and UCH-L1 cut-offs was performed with
serum samples from subjects participating in the multi-site study within 4 years after
collection and stored frozen at -60°C. The BRAINI study was designed following the main
inclusion and non-inclusion criteria defined for the ALERT-TBI cohort. Only the serum

intoxication etc.
C Dangerous mechanism of injury was pedestrian hit by a car.
The clinical performance of the VIDAS TBI (GFAP, UCH-L1) was evaluated by testing 562
serum specimens of this BRAINI sub-cohort at three clinical sites including two in the U.S.,
with operators of the test blinded to the CT results associated with the study subjects. The
intracranial lesions were defined as any trauma-induced or related finding visualized upon
head CT scan, and may have included acute epidural hematomas, acute subdural hematomas,
indeterminate extra-axial lesions, cortical contusions, parenchymal hematomas, non-
hemorrhagic contusions, ventricle compression, brain herniation, intraventricular
hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, petechial hemorrhage and global or focal brain
edema.

The expected values from 513 apparently healthy donors (53.8% male and 46.2% female)
ranging in age from 18 to 85 were determined in accordance with CLSI guideline C28-A3c. The
mean (SD) age was 47.3 (15.9) years. The races/ethnicity in the population is 25.2% Caucasian,
24.8% Hispanic, 25% Asian, and 25% African American. Data analysis was performed
separately for the GFAP and UCH-L1 biomarkers. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles for both
biomarkers were calculated non-parametrically. The results are shown below.
