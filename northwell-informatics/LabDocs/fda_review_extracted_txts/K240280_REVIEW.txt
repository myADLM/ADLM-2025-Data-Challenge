See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Nano-Check RSV Test is a rapid immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection
of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nucleoprotein antigen in anterior nasal swab specimens from
patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infections. This test is intended for in vitro
diagnostic use to aid in the diagnosis of RSV infections in infants and pediatric patients aged 6
months to 6 years old, and adults over 60 years of age.
Negative results do not preclude RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for
treatment or other management decisions. A negative test is presumptive. It is recommended that
negative test results be confirmed by viral cell culture or an alternative method, such as an FDA-
cleared molecular assay.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Nano-Check RSV Test is an immunochromatographic lateral flow assay for detection of
extracted RSV nucleoprotein antigens in human anterior nasal swab specimens. To initiate
testing, a flocked swab is used to collect anterior nasal swab specimens from both nostrils. The
patient swab sample is placed into a Reagent Tube containing extraction buffer. The buffer
disrupts the virus particles present in the sample, exposing the internal viral nucleoproteins. The
test device is comprised of a plastic cassette containing the test strip and the sample well (Figure
1). After the extraction step, the sample is dispensed into the sample well of the test device.
K240280 - Page 2 of 16

Figure 1: Test Device of Nano-Check RSV Test
The sample will migrate up the test strip via capillary action. If RSV nucleoprotein antigens are
present, they will bind to the colloidal gold particles coupled with monoclonal antibodies
specifically targeting the RSV nucleoprotein antigen. The antigen-conjugate immunocomplexes
migrate across the test strip and are captured at the test line (T) of the nitrocellulose membrane
forming a visible pinkish-red line. Sample continues to flow through the test device which also
contains a procedural control line (C) to assess adequate sample flow and functioning of the test
device. A visible pinkish-red line at the control line (C) should always appear if the assay is
performed correctly. If no visible signal appears on (C) line, the test result is invalid, and this
sample should be tested again with another test cassette. Test results are read 15 minutes after the
sample is added to the cassette.
The Nano-Check RSV Test kit contains reagents sufficient to run 20 tests and includes:
• 20 Test devices in sealed aluminum foil pouch with desiccant
• 20 Reagent tubes prefilled with 350 µL extraction buffer containing buffer with
detergents, antibiotics and sodium azide
• 20 Dropper tips
• 20 Individually packed sterile nasal swabs
• One Positive Control swab
• One Negative Control swab
• One Instructions for Use (IFU)
• One Quick Reference Instructions (QRI)
External positive control and negative control swabs are provided with each kit of Nano-Check
RSV Antigen Tests and are intended to be used as quality control samples to confirm that the
reagents are functional and the assay procedure is performed correctly.
B Principle of Operation:
The Nano-Check RSV Test employs lateral flow technology in a sandwich design to detect
nucleoprotein antigens from RSV in anterior nasal samples. Following sample collection, the
swab is placed in the reagent tube containing extraction buffer to lyse the sample and release
viral nucleoproteins. After lysis, two drops of the sample are loaded into the test cassette sample
well. The sample migrates across a pad containing colloidal gold-labelled monoclonal antibodies
to RSV nucleoprotein antigen. If RSV nucleoprotein antigens are present, they will bind to the
colloidal gold particles coupled with monoclonal antibodies specifically targeting the RSV
nucleoprotein antigen. The antigen-conjugate immunocomplexes migrate across the test strip and
are captured at the Test Line (T) of the nitrocellulose membrane forming a visible pinkish-red
line. Sample continues to flow through the test device which also contains a procedural Control
Line (C). A visible pinkish-red line at the Control Line should always appear if the assay is
performed correctly to verify proper liquid flow and capturing of gold particles in the test device.
K240280 - Page 3 of 16

--- Page 4 ---
Test results are read 15 minutes after the sample is added to the cassette. A pink-red line at the
Test Line and a pink-red line at the Control Line indicate a positive sample. A pink-red line at
the Control Line only indicates a negative sample. Any test without a visible line at the Control
Line should be interpreted as invalid and testing should be repeated with a new device.

a) Within Laboratory Precision
A precision study was conducted at one internal site, with two operators testing samples
twice daily over 12 days. Test samples were contrived in negative nasal clinical matrix
(NCM), spiked with RSV A Long strain to target concentrations. Four panel members
were prepared: true negative (NCM, unspiked), high negative (0.1x LoD), low positive
(1x LoD), and moderate positive (3x LoD). The test samples were prepared by coating
the viral solutions onto the swabs. The samples were randomized and blind-coded. Each
operator tested two replicates of each sample in each run (two runs per day), for a total of
96 replicates per panel member. Results are summarized below and in Table 1:

b) Reproducibility
Another study was conducted to evaluate the reproducibility of the Nano-Check RSV
Test at three external CLIA-waived sites with a total of seven untrained operators.
Samples were also tested at one internal site with three trained operators. A total of three
lots of test devices were used. Operators tested a randomized blind-coded panel of
contrived samples at four concentration levels (prepared in the same manner as above for
the precision study), with three replicates per level tested by each operator over five days.
Per concentration level, 150 replicates were tested (10 operators x 5 days of testing x 3
replicates per day) for a total of 600 results. No invalid test results were obtained during
the study. The results, stratified by site, are summarized below in Table 2. No significant
differences between sites, or between trained and untrained operators were observed.

a) Cross-Reactivity and Microbial Interference Study
Cross-reactivity and potential microbial interference were evaluated by testing various
bacteria, viruses and fungi with the Nano-Check RSV Test. Each organism was tested in
three replicates in the absence and presence of 3x LoD RSV in pooled negative clinical
nasal matrix using one lot of the kit reagents. The testing concentrations for potentially
interfering microorganisms were ≥105 units/mL for viruses and ≥106 units/mL for other
microorganisms, unless otherwise noted in the table below. None of the evaluated
organisms demonstrated cross-reactivity or interference with the assay at the tested
concentrations. Results are summarized in Table 3 below.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Internal Controls
The Nano-Check RSV Test has a built-in internal procedural control which monitors that
sufficient volume of the sample is added and the reagent flow across the membrane
occurred. Formation of a pinkish-red line in the control region on the strip confirms
proper sample application and that the reagents are functioning appropriately. If no
visible signal appears on the control line, the test result is invalid, and the operator is
instructed in the labelling to test the sample again with another test device.
b) External Controls
The Nano-Check RSV Test kit contains one positive external control swab and one
negative external control swab that allows for monitoring of the performance of the
assay. The positive control swab contains noninfectious RSV antigen and the negative
control swab contains noninfectious nasal clinical matrix.
Lot-to-lot precision of the external positive and negative control swabs was evaluated by
testing ten replicates each of three lots of the external controls. For each external control
lot, all positive and negative controls produced 100% agreement with the expected
results, as summarized in Table 5 below.

Negative Control
3 10/10 0/10 100%
c) Specimen Stability
Specimen stability was assessed using a negative sample (consisting of pooled negative
human nasal fluid) and a contrived low positive sample (containing RSV A Long strain at
2x LoD in the pooled negative human nasal fluid). Contrived samples on the swabs were
stored at ambient temperature (23.5°C), high room temperature (30°C), refrigerated (2-
8°C) and frozen conditions (-20°C) before extraction and tested at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48
hours. Five replicates of each concentration were tested in accordance with the package
insert at each timepoint for each condition. The results obtained in this study are
summarized below.

The results showed that the nasal swab samples were stable for up 48 hours under all
temperature conditions, ranging from -20°C to 30°C. These results support the specimen
stability claim of one hour after collection of the nasal swab when kept at room
temperature (15°C to 30°C), or within 24 hours when stored refrigerated (2°C to 8°C).
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of Nano-Check RSV Test was established for four RSV
strains. Contrived samples were prepared by spiking the two RSV A and two RSV B strains
into pooled negative nasal fluid confirmed negative for RSV. Initially 10-fold serial dilutions
of RSV strains in pooled negative nasal fluid were prepared and tested in triplicate to find the
lowest level detectable by the Nano-Check RSV Test. Further characterization was
performed using closely spaced 2-fold dilutions of RSV strains. The final LoD, a
concentration producing 95% positivity, was confirmed by testing thirty replicates of RSV
strains at the selected preliminary LoD. The results from these studies are summarized below
in Table 7.

7. High-dose Hook Effect Study
A high-dose hook effect study was conducted to determine if a Hook Effect would be
observed at high analyte concentration (i.e., a false negative at high concentrations of RSV).
Four different RSV strains (RSV A Long, RSV A2, RSV B 18537 and RSV B1) were diluted
to four or five different concentrations (see Table 8 below) in pooled negative nasal fluid
matrix and tested in three replicates on Nano-Check RSV Test. Concentrations ranged from
10,000x LoD (the maximum virus concentration possible, undiluted from the viral stock) to
1x LoD diluted in negative clinical matrix. All tested samples demonstrated 100% positivity,
as expected (Table 8). The Nano-Check RSV Test did not display a Hook Effect for the tested
RSV concentrations.

8. Inclusivity (Analytical Reactivity)
An inclusivity study was performed to demonstrate that the Nano-Check RSV Test can detect
a broad range of RSV strains. In addition to the strains evaluated in the LoD study, seven
strains of RSV A and two strains of RSV B were included in the study. Ten-fold dilutions of
virus stocks were prepared in pooled negative nasal fluid matrix and 50 tested in five
replicates in this study. The lowest concentration of each strain that resulted in 100%
detection (5/5) is presented in the table below.

2. Matrix Comparison:
The sponsor conducted a matrix equivalency study between clinical anterior nasal fluid and a
representative negative clinical matrix (nasal wash). Clinical nasal wash was used in some
analytical studies (reproducibility/precision, cross-reactivity, interference, and reagent/kit
storage). Equivalence was evaluated using one strain each for RSV A (Long strain) and RSV
B (B1 strain). Virus cultures were diluted into the matrices at three concentrations: 0.1x LoD,
1x LoD and 3x LoD and tested with 10 replicates for 3x LoD and 0.3x LoD and 20 replicates
for 1x LoD. Negativity of each of the matrices was determined by testing five replicates of
each of the matrices. The results obtained in this study are summarized below. The data
demonstrated equivalent performance of the test with all the three matrices.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of the Nano-Check RSV Test in detecting RSV nucleoprotein antigen was
evaluated in a multi-center, prospective study across six geographically diverse CLIA-
waived sites testing sites using anterior nasal (AN) swab samples collected from patients
with signs and symptoms consistent with respiratory tract infection. The study was conducted
between November 2023 to March 2024. Informed consent was obtained for all patients prior
to testing. Two AN swabs were collected sequentially from each subject. The first swab (for
comparator testing) was collected by the study operator from both sides of the nose and
placed into transport media for comparator testing. The second swab was collected by the
study operator from both sides of the nose and tested immediately with the Nano-Check RSV
Test at the site. The performance of the Nano-Check RSV Test with AN swabs was estimated
based on the comparison with results obtained with an FDA cleared molecular test for RSV
(positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA)).
A total of 886 patients were enrolled in the clinical study of which 68 were excluded due to
protocol deviations, leaving 818 specimens to be included in the calculations of estimates of
assay performance. Specimens were collected from pediatric patients between 6 months to 6
years of age and adult patients 60 years or older. Of those, 29% (237/818) were from subjects
6 months to 2 years old, 36.9% (302/818) were from patients 2 to 6 years of age and 34.1%

(279/818) were from patients 60 years or older. There were 52.4% (429/818) females and
47.6% (389/818) males.
The clinical performance of the Nano-Check RSV Test, expressed as PPA and NPA with the
comparator result, testing AN swab specimens from patients with symptoms of respiratory
tract infection, is shown in Table 11 below.

Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) = 99.6% (95% CI: 98.8% - 99.9%)
2. Clinical Specificity:
See section “Clinical sensitivity” above, including test specificity/negative percent agreement
(NPA). The NPA for the test is 99.6% (704/707; 95% CI: 98.8% - 99.9%).
D Clinical Cut-Off:
The Clinical Cut-off study is not applicable, as there is no clinical cutoff related to the presence
of RSV in patient samples.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The rate of positivity as determined by the Nano-Check RSV Test during the 2023-2024 clinical
study was 11.7% (96/818).
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
