B Measurand:
d-Amphetamine, d-Methamphetamine, Benzoylecgonine, Morphine, Phencyclidine and Delta-9-
Tetrahydrocannabinol
C Type of Test:
Qualitative, lateral flow immunoassay
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The LYHER® Oral fluid Multi-Drug Test Kit (Cube) is a rapid lateral flow immunoassay for the
qualitative detection of d-Amphetamine, d-Methamphetamine, Benzoylecgonine, Morphine,
Phencyclidine and Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol in human oral fluid. The test cut-off
concentrations and the compounds the tests are calibrated to are as follows:
Test Calibrator Cut-off (ng/ml)
Opiates(OPI) Morphine 40
Cocaine (COC) Benzoylecgonine 20
Amphetamine (AMP) d-Amphetamine 50
Marijuana (THC) Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol 40
Methamphetamine (MET) d-Methamphetamine 50
Phencyclidine (PCP) Phencyclidine 10
The tests provide only a preliminary result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be
used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical test result. Gas Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry (GC/MS), Liquid Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) and their tandem
mass-spectrometer versions are the preferred confirmatory methods. Careful consideration and
judgment should be applied to any drugs of abuse screen test result, particularly when evaluating
preliminary positive results.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

D Special Instrument Requirements:
None
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The LYHER® Oral fluid Multi-Drug Test Kit (Cube) is an immunochromatographic assay that
uses a lateral flow system for the qualitative detection of d-Amphetamine, d-Methamphetamine,
Benzoylecgonine, Morphine, Phencyclidine and Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol in human oral
fluid. The LYHER® Oral fluid Multi-Drug Test Kit (Cube) device consists of a cube device, an
oral fluid collection swab and a package insert.
B Principle of Operation:
Each device employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology and is based on the
principle of competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the cutoff level, will
not saturate the binding sites of the antibody coated particles on the drug specific test strips. The
goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-
specific conjugate. If the level of drug in the oral fluid specimen is below the cutoff
concentration, the T line appears as a visible burgundy line. If the level of drug in the oral fluid
specimen is above the cutoff, no T line develops. The control line (C line) serves as an internal
quality control. The control line should always appear as a burgundy-colored band regardless of
the presence of the drug, if enough sample volume has been added to the test and if the sample
has correctly migrated up the test strip.

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cut off, -75%
cut off, -50% cut off, -25% cut off, cut off, +25% cut off, +50% cut off , +75% cut off and
+100% cut off. These samples were prepared by spiking drug in negative oral fluid samples.
All drug concentration were confirmed by LC-MS/MS and all sample aliquots were blindly
labeled by the person who prepared the samples and didn’t take part in the sample testing.
Precision of the product was characterized at three different sites using 3 operators with 3
lots of cubes. For each concentration, two runs per day for 30 days per device lot were
performed in a randomized order. Results are summarized below.

Sample Volume:
A sample volume study was conducted to confirm the reproducibility of adequate sample volume
collection by the device. Operators collected samples at two sites from a total 150 subjects
(including drug users) following the device’s instructions for use. Operators swept the inside of
volunteer’s mouth (cheek, gums, and tongue), and then held the swab in the subject’s mouth for
3 minutes.
Mean volume collected by the swabs for cube format was 2.05 mL with a minimum volume of
1.6 mL, and a maximum volume of 2.5 mL.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Exogenous Interference: Potential interference from structurally unrelated compounds were
tested by spiking the potentially interfering compound at a concentration of 10 ug/mL into
drug free oral fluid or fluid containing the target drug with concentrations of 50% below and
50% above cutoff level. The following compounds were found not to interfere with test
results at a concentration of 10 ug/mL for all samples tested.

The following potential interference from substances commonly present in oral fluid were
evaluated by spiking into drug free oral fluid or oral fluid containing the target drug with
concentrations of 50% below and 50% above cutoff level to a concentration of 5%: alcohol,
baking soda, chewing gum, coffee, cola, cough syrup, cranberry juice, food coloring (blue,
green, and red), methanol cough drops, milk, mouthwash, monosodium glutamate (MSG),
orange juice, salt, sugar, tea, toothpaste, and tomatoes. None of these substances showed any
interference with any of the analytes in the candidate device.
Potential interference from cigarette smoking was evaluated by asking a participant to smoke
a cigarette, and after 15 minutes an oral fluid sample was collected and spiked with each drug
at concentrations of cutoff +/- 50%. No interference was seen with any of the analytes in the
candidate device.
Potential interference from Hemoglobin (blood) was evaluated by adding it to drug free oral
fluid and oral fluid containing the target drug with concentrations of 50% above and 50%
below cutoff level to a concentration of 100 ug/mL. No interference was seen with any of the
analytes in the candidate device.
Effect of oral fluid pH: To investigate the effect of oral fluid pH, oral fluid samples with pH
3 to 9 were spiked with target drugs at 50% below and 50% above Cut-Off levels. These
samples were tested using three lots of the device. Results were all positive for samples at
and above +50% Cut-Off and all negative for samples at and below -50% Cut-Off.
Cross-reactivity. To evaluate cross reactivity, drug metabolites and other components that
may be present in oral fluid samples were tested using three lots of the device. The following
are summaries of the cross-reactivities.

Volume:
A sample volume study was conducted to confirm that adequate sample volume could be
extracted from the device for confirmatory testing after collection and shipping. Operators
collected samples at two sites from a total 150 subjects (including drug users) following the
device’s instructions for use. Devices containing oral fluid samples were then sent to the
confirmation laboratory using overnight shipping. The sponsor reported that the confirmation
lab was able to extract sufficient sample volume for the confirmation testing of all six
analytes for all samples collected.

Analyte recovery:
In order to confirm that preliminary positive results can be adequately measured via
confirmation testing after being subject to the temperature conditions required for shipping
and storage, negative oral fluid samples in glass bottles were spiked with a single
analyte/bottle to concentrations approximately -50% and +50% of the cutoff. Samples were
spiked using known standards. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. The
samples were transferred to Lyher devices using the collection sponges. For each of 3
storage conditions (-20°C, 20-25°C, and 40°C), 12 devices were used (4 devices from each of
3 lots. For each device, drug was measured by LC-MS/MS at day 0 and the devices
containing the specimens were stored under the specified condition. Drug in the devices
stored at 20-25°C and 40°C was measured by LC-MS/MS at two (2) days, and drug in the
devices stored at -20°C was measured by LC-MS/MS at 90 days. The minimum and
maximum recovery across all lots per storage condition is shown below.

Results indicate that samples may be stored at room temperature for up to two days, elevated
temperature for up to two days (40 °C), and for up to 90 days at – 20 °C, prior to
confirmatory testing.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section VII A1 above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were performed at three testing sites A, B, and C with three
operators and two lots of the candidate device. One lot was used at site A and a second lot
was used at sites B and C. Subjects provided three independent samples, each to one of three
different operators. Operators tested all samples and compared to LC-MS/MS results. The
results are presented in the tables below:
