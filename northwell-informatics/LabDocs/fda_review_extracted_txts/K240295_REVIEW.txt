A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
InstaStrip Fentanyl Rapid Test (Urine) is intended for the qualitative detection of fentanyl in
human urine at the cutoff value of 1.0 ng/mL. The test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC)
use.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative chemical
method (e.g., gas or liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry) must be used in order to
obtain a confirmed analytical result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result is
positive.
The InstaStrip Fentanyl Dipstick Test (Urine) is intended for the qualitative detection of fentanyl
in human urine at the cutoff value of 1.0 ng/mL.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative chemical
method (e.g., gas or liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry) must be used in order to
obtain a confirmed analytical result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result is
positive.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
InstaStrip Fentanyl Rapid Test (Urine) and InstaStrip Fentanyl Dipstick Test (Urine) are an
immunoassay technique that is based on competitive lateral flow immunoassay intended for the
qualitative detection of fentanyl in human urine. The candidate devices consist of a urine cup,
test tube, dropper, test strip, tube stand, and package insert. Each test strip is sealed with sachets
of desiccant in an aluminum pouch.
B Principle of Operation:
The urine sample is added to a provided test tube containing dried rabbit monoclonal antibody-
gold nanoparticle (Ab-AuNP) conjugates. The test tube is shaken until the Ab-AuNP pellet is
dissolved and the sample turns pink. The test strip is then inserted into the test tube and the user
caps the test tube. The pre-immobilized fentanyl-BSA on the test line competes with fentanyl in
the urine sample for binding to the Ab-AuNPs. The device is designed so that when the fentanyl
concentration in the urine sample exceeds 1 ng/mL, the test line is no longer visible. The test line
K240295 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
will be visible and the result is negative when the fentanyl concentration in the urine sample is
less than 1 ng/mL. No matter whether the sample contains the corresponding analyte or not, the
quality control area (C) will develop a colored line, which is the criteria for judging whether the
chromatography process is normal or not.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies for InstaStrip Fentanyl Rapid Test (Urine) and InstaStrip Fentanyl Dipstick
Test (Urine) were carried out at one site. The randomized and blinded study was performed for
samples with concentrations of -100% cut-off, -75% cut-off, -50% cut-off, -25% cut-off, cut-off,
+25% cut-off, +50% cut-off, +75% cut-off and +100% cut-off where the fentanyl cut-off
concentration was 1 ng/mL. Samples with concentration of -100% cut-off were drug-free urine
samples. Other samples were prepared by spiking target drug fentanyl in drug-free urine
samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC/MS. The samples were tested by three
operators using three different device lots over a 10-day period, each operator tested a single lot.
Six tests per day per concentration per lot were tested for a total 54 tests per day per lot.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable, this device is intended for qualitative use only.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross- Reactivity:
To test specificity, similarly structured drug metabolites and other components that are likely to
interfere in urine samples were tested using three lots of device by three different operators.
Results are expressed as a minimum concentration of metabolite or compound required to
produce a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. The
percent cross reactivity of those compounds is listed below (if no cross reactivity was observed,
the highest concentration tested is shown as <0.01%):

Lay User Study:
A lay user was performed at three intended user sites with 140 lay persons. The lay users had
diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 18 to >50 years. Urine
samples were prepared at the following concentrations: -100%, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the
cut-off by spiking fentanyl into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the
samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers, blind-
labeled and randomized. Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled
sample and a device. A summary of the results is shown in the table below.
