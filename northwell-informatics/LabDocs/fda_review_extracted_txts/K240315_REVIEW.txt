IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
K240315 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
INNOVANCE Anti-Xa assay is a one stage chromogenic assay based on a synthetic
chromogenic substrate and on Factor Xa inactivation. The reagent kit consists of two
components. One component (Reagent) contains Xa, the other (Substrate) a chromogenic
substrate specific for Xa. The assay provides quantitative UFH/LMWH and apixaban results on
3.2% citrated human plasma when used with INNOVANCE Heparin Calibrator and
INNOVANCE Apixaban Standards.
For measuring apixaban:
INNOVANCE Apixaban Standards are lyophilized reagents of two levels (Standard 0 and 1).
They consist of human plasmas with either no apixaban (Standard 0) or a defined concentration
of apixaban calibrated against an apixaban reference preparation (Standard 1).
INNOVANCE Apixaban Controls are lyophilized reagents of two levels (Control 0 and 1). They
consist of human plasmas with defined concentrations of apixaban.
For measuring UFH/LMWH:
The INNOVANCE Heparin Calibrator consists of five calibrator levels. INNOVANCE Heparin
Calibrator 1 represents plasma containing no heparin. INNOVANCE Heparin Calibrators 2, 3, 4
and 5 are plasmas with defined activities of LMWH and are calibrated against the WHO (World
Health Organization) International Standards for UFH and LMWH.
The INNOVANCE Heparin Control consists of plasmas with defined activities of either UFH
(control 1 and 2) or LMWH (control 1 and 2).
B Principle of Operation
INNOVANCE Anti-Xa assay is one stage chromogenic assay. Upon mixing of INNOVANCE
Anti-Xa REAGENT and INNOVANCE Anti-Xa SUBSTRATE, Xa converts the chromogenic
substrate into two products, one of them is paranitroaniline. The formation of paranitroaniline
can be quantified by the coagulation analyzer employing light absorption at a specific
wavelength (405 nm).
In the presence of a heparin containing sample, the formation of paranitroaniline will be reduced
in a time dependent manner. This is due to inhibition of Xa by the heparin/AT complex. This
complex is formed in the patient's plasma and competes with the substrate conversion by Xa.
The concentration of the complex is not only dependent on the concentration of heparin but also
on the availability of the patient’s endogenous antithrombin. By comparison to a reference curve
the heparin activity of the sample can be quantified.
In the presence of an apixaban containing sample factor Xa is inhibited directly by this inhibitor.
Comparison to an inhibitor specific reference curve allows quantification of the inhibitor
concentration in the sample.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The study was conducted over 20 days with two runs per day and two replicates per run for a
total of 240 determinations (i.e., 80 determinations per reagent lot). This study was
performed at three (3) internal sites with one SYSMEX CS-2500 instrument per site, by
using five patient plasma pool samples and two QC materials with varying levels of
apixaban. For investigating different assay and standard lots, each sample was analyzed by:
1) three reagent lots combined with one standard lot, 2) three standard lots combined with
one reagent lot, 3) three control lots combined with one reagent and one standard lot.
Precision estimates were calculated for each of the following variance components:
repeatability (within-run), between-run, between-day, between-lot and total imprecision
(within-laboratory). The results are provided in the summary table below.

2. Linearity:
Linearity studies were performed using three reagent lots of INNOVANCE Anti-Xa on one
SYSMEX CS-2500 instrument. A dilution series of apixaban in plasma with assigned values
that were prepared by mixing blank (normal citrated pooled plasma containing no apixaban)
with a high pool (normal citrated plasma pool spiked with apixaban). A total of 11 samples
covering the range of 10.5 to 378 ng/mL apixaban were included in this study, with each
sample tested in four replicates. A dilution recovery study was conducted to establish extend
measuring interval. Samples with five different concentrations were prepared by spiking

apixaban. Each sample was separated in two aliquots, and each aliquot was manually diluted
two times using Standard Human Plasma. Each dilution was measured two times by two
operators so the total number of measurements per sample is eight.
Based on the results of the Linearity studies and Detection Limit studies, the claimed assay
reportable range is 20–700 ng/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were conducted based on the CLSI EP07, 3rd Edition. The study
evaluated potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances with one reagent lot
and one standard lot on one SYSMEX CS-2500 instrument using a dose-response method.
Potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances were spiked into low plasma
pool (containing 30–50 ng/mL apixaban) and high plasma pool (containing 280–350 ng/mL
apixaban) in nine dilution levels and each sample level were run in four replicates.
Apixaban results are not affected by the interferences up to the respective concentrations
listed in the table below:
Interfering Substances No interference up to
Hemoglobin 191 mg/dL
Bilirubin, conjugated 31 mg/dL
Bilirubin, unconjugated 17 mg/dL
Lipids 150 mg/dL
Rivaroxaban 5.3 ng/mL
Fondaparinux 60.0 ng/mL
Danaparoid sodium 0.05 U/mL
LMWH 0.07 IU/mL

A traceability and uncertainty of the analytical values for INNOVANCE Apixaban Standard
1 and Controls to purified apixaban reference material for the assay INNOVANCE Anti-Xa
was conducted on the Automated Blood Coagulation Analyzer CS-2500, to evaluate if
standards/controls can be related to stated references, usually national or international
standards, through an unbroken chain of comparisons all having stated uncertainties. Since
no international certified reference material for apixaban is available, the study was
performed with 11 plasmas spiked with “In house” reference material (a stock solution of
weighed apixaban) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and with values assigned to defined
concentrations of apixaban in plasma. Value assignments are traceable to purified apixaban
reference material.
Value assignment of the commercial INNOVANCE Apixaban Standards is performed on the
SYSMEX CS-2500 using a Master Standard lot which is traceable to the purified Reference
Material.
Apixaban Standard 0: 0 ng/mL
Apixaban Standard 1: 420 ng/mL
Value assignment of the commercial INNOVANCE Apixaban Controls is performed on the
SYSMEX CS-2500 using released INNOVANCE Apixaban Standards lots which are
calibrated against a Master Standards lot that is traceable to the purified Reference Material.
Apixaban Control 1: 77 ng/mL
Apixaban Control 2: 284 ng/mL
Reagent stability
The stability study results support the following claim:
The shelf-life for INNOVANCE Anti-Xa is 24 months when stored at 2–8°C. The shelf-life
for INNOVANCE Apixaban Standards and Controls is 30 months when stored at 2–8°C.
The in-use stability for INNOVANCE Anti-Xa is 8 weeks at 2–8°C. The in-use stability for
INNOVANCE Apixaban Standards is 40 hours at 2–8°C and up to 12 hours at 15–25°C. The
in-use stability for INNOVANCE Apixaban Controls is 48 hours at 2–8°C, up to 20 hours at
15–25°C and 4 weeks at ≤ -18°C.
The on-board stability for INNOVANCE Anti-Xa is 24 hours. The on-board stability for
INNOVANCE Apixaban Standards is 4 hours. The on-board stability for INNOVANCE
Apixaban Controls is 5 hours when transferred in Sample Cup and placed on the sample rack,
24 hours when transferred to SLD mini cup and placed on the reagent table.
Sample Stability
Sample stability studies were performed to support the recommended storage and handling
instructions found in the device labeling. Twenty nine citrated plasma samples (4 samples
with an apixaban concentration ≤ 50 ng/mL, 25 samples with an apixaban concentration ≥ 50
ng/mL) were tested after storage in the following temperature ranges: at 2 to 8°C in primary
tube (plasma stored over cells) and in secondary tube (plasma siphoned from cells), at 15 to
25°C in primary tube and in secondary tube, at ≤ -18°C in secondary tube, at ≤ -70°C in
secondary tube and at ≤ -70°C (one frozen thaw cycle). The study was performed using one
reagent lot, one standard lot, and one control lot, with four replicate measurements at each
time point for each sample. The study data demonstrate that apixaban in citrated plasma
samples can be stored at 15–25°C in primary tube (plasma stored over cells) and in

secondary tube (plasma siphoned from cells) for 4 hours; stored in secondary tube at ≤ -18°C
for one month; stored in secondary tube at ≤ -74°C for 5 months.
6. Detection Limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) for the
test system was determined following the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline. Each study design
included two reagent lots on one SYSMEX CS-2500 instrument.
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined using five independent analyte-free samples tested
with four replicates per sample, two reagent lots and two standard lots over three days on one
system, with a total of 60 determinations per reagent lot. The LoB was determined to be 1.0
ng/mL.
Limit of detection (LoD) was determined using five low analyte samples prepared by spiking
platelet-poor plasma from five donors containing no apixaban, tested with four replicates per
sample, with total 60 determinations per reagent lot. The LoD was determined to be 3.3
ng/mL.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined using five low analyte samples prepared by
spiking platelet-poor plasma from five donors containing no apixaban, tested with four
replicates per sample, with total 60 determinations per reagent lot. The LoQ was determined
to be 15.8 ng/mL.
