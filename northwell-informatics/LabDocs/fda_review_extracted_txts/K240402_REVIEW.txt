(PLT), hemoglobin concentration (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), and mean corpuscular volume
(MCV);
- 5-Part WBC Differential (WBC Diff): neutrophil count and percentage (NEUT and NEUT%),
lymphocyte count and percentage (LYMPH and LYMPH%), monocyte count and percentage
(MONO and MONO%), eosinophil count and percentage (EO and EO%), basophil count and
percentage (BASO and BASO%).
It is not indicated for use in diagnosing or monitoring of oncology patients, critically ill patients,
or children under the age of 2 years.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The CytoChip Cito CBC System is an automated hematology analyzer that is intended to analyze
K EDTA venous human whole blood, and report results of 16 hematology parameters (WBC,
2
RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, MCV, LYMPH #/%, NEUT #/%, MONO #/%, EO #/%, and BASO
#/%). The system is comprised of an automated benchtop reader instrument (Cito CBC
Analyzer), accessories, and disposable Cito CBC test kits. Each test kit includes 25 individually
packaged test cartridges, alcohol wipes, a sample dispensing tips, one sealing card and package
insert.
The Cito CBC Analyzer contains the essential hardware and software to perform a test with a
disposable cartridge. It consists of 1) pneumatic module to actuate fluid transfer in the cartridge,
2) optical module to detect signals from the cartridge, 3) heating module to accelerate the
K240402 - Page 2 of 21

--- Page 3 ---
chemistry reaction in the cartridge, 4) control and signal board; 5) on-board computer for results
computation and user interface. All reagents, sample and bio-waste are self-contained in the
cartridge and has no physical contact with the analyzer.
B Principle of Operation:
The Cito CBC system uses two detection modules in the reader instrument for measurement of a
test run: fluorescent flow cytometry and photometry. The Cito CBC system utilizes the principle
of fluorescent flow cytometry for cell count and cell classification. A laser is used as the light
source, and fluorescence and light scattering signals are detected for the measurements. For
fluorescent labeling, blood cells are treated with a fluorescent dye that has high affinity binding
to nucleic acid. Additionally, the analyzer utilizes the principle of two-wavelength photometry
for the measurement of the hemoglobin. Blood cells are lysed to release hemoglobin. Meanwhile,
the light scattering signal measured from the flow cytometry and the light absorption signals
measured from the photometry are both used to quantify the hematocrit and the mean cell
volume.
The Cito CBC Cartridge contains all the reagents needed for performing the test, including:
- A first reagent. It consists of a salt-based buffer solution to dilute a blood sample, which
is used for downstream analysis and HGB/HCT testing.
- A second reagent. It consists of surfactants to lyse RBCs and release hemoglobin. It also
contains a fluorescent dye to label the nucleic acids in the cells. This reagent mixes with a
portion of the diluted blood to form a sample mixture for WBC, WBC Diff, and
HGB/HCT testing.
- A third reagent. It consists of a salt-based buffer solution to further dilute the blood. It
also contains a dye to label the nucleic acids in the cells. This reagent mixes with a
portion of the diluted blood to form a sample mixture for RBC and PLT testing.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Cito CBC Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Barcode scanner or manual entry
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Venous whole blood is collected in vacutainer tube with K EDTA anticoagulant as test
2
specimen. The tube is inverted at least ten times to mix the sample before testing. A
dispenser tip is inserted into the tube cap, and pressed against the inlet port of the test
cartridge to dispense blood. The dispensed blood is drawn into the test cartridge by capillary
force. Blood residue on the inlet port is wiped away with an alcohol pad, and the cartridge
inlet seal is manually closed. The test cartridge is then inserted to the analyzer to complete
the automatic measurement, and the result will be reported.

4. Calibration:
The Cito CBC System is factory calibrated. No user calibration is required.
5. Quality Control:
The system performance is evaluated using a commercial QC kit, Cito CBC Control. The QC
materials are a tri-level (low, normal, high) whole blood control that contains human cells,
mammalian cells and microspheres suspended in a plasma-like fluid with preservatives. The
system guides users to test each level of the QC material in sequence, and determine
automatically whether the QC test is passed or failed. If QC fails, the system software will
deactivate the user access to perform a sample test. QC test is recommended: 1) when using
the Cito CBC Analyzer for the first time; 2) with each new shipment of test kits; 2) when
new operator to perform testing; 3) anytime an unexpected issue is encountered; 4) at least
every 30 days.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a) Repeatability with whole blood samples
Venous whole blood (K EDTA anticoagulated) was used to evaluate the precision of
2
reported CBC parameters, including 5-part differential. Three CLIA-waived sites participated
in this study, and each site used one analyzer and three untrained operators, totaling three
analyzers and nine untrained operators overall. For the three sites, in total 45 blood samples
were tested to cover the three sub-ranges (low, medium, high), including MDLs, for WBC,
K240402 - Page 7 of 21

--- Page 8 ---
RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT and MCV. Ten (10) consecutive tests were performed for each
sample. The study calculates the SD (standard deviation) and %CV (coefficient of variation)
for each reported parameter. The study results pool the SD and %CV together across the
three sites, following the protocol of CLSI document EP05-A3. The pooled SD and pooled
%CV meet the acceptance criteria for all reported parameters in the three sub-ranges (low,
medium, high), as shown below.

b) Cartridge lot-to-lot Precision
A study was performed to evaluate the lot-to-lot variability of the test cartridge. Three
cartridge lots were used in the study, and venous whole blood (K EDTA anticoagulated) was
2
tested to assess the between-lot component. A total of 19 samples were tested in this study.
For each sample, 5 replicate tests were performed for each cartridge lot (15 tests for three
lots). ANOVA analysis was performed according to CLSI EP05-A3 to calculate the between-
lot %CV and total %CV, which meet the acceptance criteria, as shown below.

c) Reproducibility
The reproducibility performance was evaluated by testing QC materials. Three CLIA-waived
sites participated in this study, and each site used one analyzer and at least two untrained
operators. At each site, the study was performed for 5 days. In each day, 2 test runs were
performed with 3 replicates per run. One lot of the QC materials (three levels: low, normal,
and high) was used and a total of 90 replicates were performed for each control level over the
study duration (3 sites×5 days×2 test runs×3 replicates per run). ANOVA analysis was
performed according to CLSI EP05-A3 to calculate the SD and %CV for within-run
(repeatability), between-run, between-day, between-site, and total precision for each control
level. The total %CV of all parameters met the acceptance criteria, as shown below.

HGB: 6.0 to 25.0 g/dL
HCT: 24.0% to 70.0%
MCV: 65.0 to 115.0 fL
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
A study was conducted to determine the interference level for the following interfering
substances: conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, intralipid, chyle, K EDTA, and
2
hemolytic hemoglobin. The interference levels were evaluated by testing fresh whole blood
(venous blood anticoagulated with K EDTA) spiked with the interferent at study
2
concentration levels. For each interferent, blood samples were spiked with the interferent,
and five replicate tests were performed with both control group (no spiking) and test group
(with spiking) for comparison. A total of three blood samples were tested for each interferent.
The non-significant %Interferences were defined as %Interferences within ±10%. The results
of the interference study demonstrated that:
There was no significant conjugated bilirubin interference up to a concentration of 40
o
mg/dL for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, and MCV.
There was no significant unconjugated bilirubin interference up to a concentration of
o
40 mg/dL for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, and MCV.
There was no significant intralipid interference up to a concentration of 2000 mg/dL
o
for WBC, PLT, and HGB, and up to a concentration of 500 mg/dL for RBC, HCT,
and MCV. Samples with intralipid > 500 mg/dL are alerted by fail-alert mechanism
and the impacted results (RBC, HCT, and MCV) are automatically suppressed.
There was no significant chyle interference up to a concentration of 2524 FTU for
o
WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, and MCV.
There was no significant hemolytic hemoglobin interference up to a concentration of
o
1.0 g/dL for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, and MCV; and up to a concentration of 0.5
g/dL for HCT.
There was no significant K EDTA interference up to a concentration of 8 mg/mL for
o 2
WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT, and MCV.
4. Reportable Range:
The measuring ranges for WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, HCT and MCV are determined from the
Linearity and the LoQ study results. After establishing the measuring ranges, the reportable
ranges are chosen to be equal to or narrower than the measuring ranges, by applying a set of
suppression levels for CLIA waived setting. After applying the suppression levels to the
measuring ranges, the reportable ranges (with suppression) are established. Refer to
submission CW240006 for detailed reportable range values for each parameter of this device.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Sample Stability
Sample stability of venous whole blood (K EDTA anticoagulated) was determined with 6
2
normal samples and 4 abnormal samples. The blood samples were stored at room
temperature (15-25°C). At time zero (0 hour), the samples were tested in triplicates to
establish the baseline. These samples were tested again in duplicate at the following time
K240402 - Page 13 of 21

--- Page 14 ---
points: 4.5 hours, 6.5 hours, and 8.5 hours. For each time point, the results were compared to
the baseline results, and the mean percentage difference was calculated to meet the
predefined acceptance criteria. The results support an 8-hour blood sample stability duration.
b) Cartridge Stability
A real-time stability study was conducted to establish shelf-life stability for the Cito CBC
system cartridge when stored at the recommended storage conditions. Three lots of cartridges
were tested. Each cartridge lot was stored at room temperature and tested at defined time
points, and then evaluated using venous whole blood samples. Based on the results of this
study, the Cito CBC cartridge shelf-life stability is 294 days at room temperature (15–25°C).
6. Detection Limit:
Four venous whole blood samples were diluted with homologous plasma to make low-level
samples and were used in this study to evaluate LoQ of WBC, RBC, PLT, HGB, and HCT.
One sample was tested on each day, and the LoQ study was conducted for four consecutive
days. For each sample, 9 replicate tests were performed with each cartridge lot, and two
cartridge lots were used to capture the reagent variability (in total 18 tests for each sample).
For the four samples, a total of 72 tests were performed, with 36 tests for each cartridge lot.
The LoQ was determined individually for two cartridge lots, and the greater LoQ between
the two cartridge lots was taken as the LoQ for each parameter.
Parameter LoQ
WBC 1.79 ×103/μL
RBC 1.68 ×106/μL
PLT 44 ×103/μL

A method comparison study was performed across three CLIA-waived testing sites (with
nine untrained operators in total) to evaluate the performance of the Cito CBC System
compared to the comparative method, Sysmex XN Automated Hematology Analyzer. A total
of 481 subjects were included in the study (117 enrolled at the CW sites and 346 residual
clinical samples). Of the 481 subjects, there were 197 female (41%) and 284 male (59%).
One K EDTA venous whole blood sample was collected from each subject. Statistical
2
analyses for the method comparison were performed based on correlation plots with Deming
regression and difference plots for bias. For each reported parameter, the slope, intercept, and
correlation coefficient from the Deming fittings, are shown in the table below.

3. Flagging Study:
A flagging study was performed across five CLIA-waived testing sites and one point-of-care
site to evaluate the flagging agreement between Cito CBC System and the comparative
method, Sysmex XN Automated Hematology Analyzer. Five hundred five (505) subjects
were included in the study (247 male and 258 female), which consists of 74 children (≥2 to
<12 years old), 77 adolescents (≥12 to <21 years old), and 354 adults (≥21 years old). One
K EDTA venous whole blood sample was collected from each subject. Additionally, 577
2
leftover samples (K EDTA venous whole blood) were selected from a clinical lab and
2
included in this study for increased coverage of abnormal samples. In total, 1082 samples
were tested for the flagging comparison. Based on the reported flags, each sample was
categorized as either Negative (no sample abnormalities) or Positive (with sample
abnormalities). The positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement and overall
agreement were calculated, and the results successfully met the acceptance criteria, as shown
below.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A reference interval study was performed to determine the reference intervals of adults and
pediatrics on the Cito CBC System. Healthy subjects were enrolled at four CLIA-waived sites
for the study, including 253 adults over 21 years old (127 male, 126 female), 46 adolescents
between 12–21 years old (21 male, 25 female), and 41 children between 2–12 years old (20
male, 21 female). One K EDTA venous whole blood sample was collected from each subject and
2
tested. For the adult group (over 21 years old), reference intervals are established by non-
parametric method following CLSI EP28-A3c. For the adolescent group (12–21 years old) and
the children group (2–12 years old), the reference intervals published in Pediatric Reference
Intervals, AACC Press, Soldin, Brugnara and Wong, 8th edition 2021, were verified on the Cito
CBC System.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
In 2008 and 2009, the Hematology and Pathology Devices Panel of the Medical Devices
Advisory Committee met to provide recommendations to the FDA regarding the CLIA waiver
application of an automated WBC analyzer. The panel expressed several concerns. Below is a
list of the panel concerns and the solutions implemented by CytoChip to mitigate these concerns.
