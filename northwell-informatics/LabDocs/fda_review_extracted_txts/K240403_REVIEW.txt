III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access BR Monitor assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for
the quantitative determination of CA 15-3 antigen levels in human serum and plasma (heparin)
using the Access Immunoassay Systems. This device is indicated for use in the measurement of
CA 15-3 antigen to aid in the management of breast cancer patients. Serial testing for CA 15-3
antigen concentrations should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods for monitoring
breast cancer.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The Instructions for Use of the device contains the following warnings:
The concentration of CA 15-3 antigen in a given specimen determined with assays from different
manufacturers can vary due to differences in assay methods and reagent specificity. The results
reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the CA 15-3 antigen
assay used. Values obtained with different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably. If, in
the course of monitoring a patient, the assay method used for determining CA 15-3 antigen
values is changed, additional sequential testing should be carried out to confirm baseline values.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (refer to K221225)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Each Access BR Monitor reagent kit contains two reagent packs (50 tests/pack). Each pack
contains the following:
• Solid phase (R1a): Paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-biotin antibodies,
biotinylated anti-CA 15-3 antigen mouse monoclonal antibodies, bovine serum albumin, <
0.1% sodium azide and 0.1% ProClin 300.
• Conjugate (R1b): Mouse monoclonal anti-CA 15-3 antigen-alkaline phosphatase (bovine)
conjugate, bovine serum albumin, < 0.1% sodium azide, 0.25% ProClin 300.
• Diluent (R1c): Buffered protein solution (bovine, goat, mouse), < 0.1% sodium azide, 0.1%
ProClin 300.
K240403 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
Materials needed but not supplied with reagent kit
• Access BR Monitor Calibrators (approximately 0, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000 U/mL)
• Quality Control (QC) materials: commercial control material
• Lumi-Phos PRO (substrate)
• UniCel DxI Wash Buffer II
• Access Sample Diluent A (optional)
The modification of the Access BR Monitor is:
(a) to replace substrate (Lumi-Phos 530) of the Access BR Monitor with a new substrate
(Lumi-Phos PRO)
(b) to run on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer with an updated the analytical
measuring interval of 0.8 – 1,000 U/mL.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access BR Monitor assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic “sandwich” assay. A sample is
added to a reaction vessel along with mouse monoclonal anti-CA 15-3 antigen alkaline
phosphatase conjugate and paramagnetic particles coated with a second mouse monoclonal anti-
CA 15-3 antigen antibody. The CA 15-3 antigen in the sample binds to the immobilized
monoclonal anti-CA 15-3 antigen on the solid phase, while the conjugate antibody reacts with a
different antigenic site on the CA 15-3 antigen molecule. After incubation, materials bound to
the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured
with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte
in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically determined from a stored calibration.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the modified Access BR Monitor on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
Analyzer was performed in accordance with CLSI guideline EP06, 2nd Edition. Two series of
samples were prepared: one series with 10 samples for the low end of the analytical
measuring interval (AMI) of the assay, the second series with nine samples for covering the
entire AMI. Each dilution series were prepared by mixing one High sample with a Low
sample. The Low sample was obtained from a native serum sample that was specifically
depleted of CA 15-3 antigen using paramagnetic particles. The High sample used for the first
series was a pool of two native serum samples with CA 15-3 at 155 U/mL and the High
sample for the second series was a pool of two native serum samples with CA 15-3 at 1186
U/mL The Low sample was run in replicates of eight, and all other samples were run in
replicates of four, and the mean (U/mL) of each dilution level was compared to its predicted

The data support the linearity interval from 0.4 to 1186 U/mL with the deviations from
linearity within ±10%. The study results support the linearity of the claimed analytical
measuring interval (AMI): 0.8 – 1,000 U/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Refer to K072612
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range is the same as the claimed measuring range: 0.8 – 1,000 U/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability
The traceability was established in K072612.
b) Stability:
The Access BR Monitor Reagent kit and the Lumi-Phos PRO substrate are packaged
separately. The stability of the Access BR Monitor Reagent kit was established in
K072612. The proposed change is to replace substrate (Lumi-Phos 530) of the Access BR
Monitor with a new substrate (Lumi-Phos PRO). The shelf-life claims and on-board
stability claims of Lumi-Phos PRO substrate were established in K221225.
6. Detection Limit:
CLSI guideline EP17-A2 was followed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of
Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the modified Access BR Monitor on
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer.
To determine LoB, the study was conducted on two DxI 9000 Immunoassay Systems with
two modified Access BR Monitor reagent lots. Five analyte depleted samples (prepared from
five individual native serum samples from which CA15-3 antigen was specifically depleted)
were tested in five replicates per run, one run per day over three days, resulting in 75

replicates for each reagent lot and each instrument. LoB was determined as 0.1 U/mL for
each of the two reagent lots based on the 95% non-parametric percentile. The claimed LoB
for the modified Access BR Monitor on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.4
U/mL.
To determine the LoD, 10 serum samples containing low levels of CA 15-3 were run in nine
replicates per run, one run per day over five days using three lots of the modified Access BR
Monitor on three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers. LoD was calculated from LoB +
“SD multiplied by the 95th percentile of the standard normal distribution” and resulted in 0.3
U/mL for each reagent lot. The claimed LoD for the modified Access BR Monitor on DxI
9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.5 U/mL.
To determine the LoQ, 12 serum samples containing low levels of CA 15-3 were run in nine
replicates per run, one run per day over five days using three lots of the modified Access BR
Monitor on three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers. A variance components model
was used to estimate the within-run and within-laboratory (total) %CV for each sample on
each instrument and reagent lot combination. The estimated LoQ of the modified Access BR
Monitor was set to be the CA 15-3 concentration which met the within-laboratory
imprecision of 20% CV. The claimed LoQ for the modified Access BR Monitor on DxI 9000
Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.8 U/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
CLSI guideline EP09c 3rd Edition was followed to compare the modified Access BR Monitor
on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer to the predicate device, the Access BR Monitor
on the Access 2 Immunoassay System. Patient samples falling within the analytical
measuring interval of both Access BR Monitor assays were evaluated. A total of 163 serum
samples (141 native samples from individual patients, 14 sample pools, and 8 samples spiked
with antigen) were evaluated with three lots of the modified Access BR Monitor on three DxI
9000 instruments and with predicate device on three Access 2 instruments. The comparison
between paired measurements was analyzed using Passing-Bablok method by fitting the
observed values with the modified Access BR Monitor assay on DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer (y, candidate) into a linear regression model, with the observed
values from the predicate (x, predicate). The results are summarized in the following table:
