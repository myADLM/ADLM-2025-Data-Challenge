B Indication(s) for Use:
The BD Vacutainer Citrate Blood Collection Tube (0.109M buffered sodium citrate) is a sterile,
single use tube used for the collection, containment, transport, and centrifugation of venous
blood specimens to obtain plasma for in vitro diagnostic testing. It is used in settings where a
venous blood sample is collected by a trained healthcare worker. The BD Vacutainer Citrate
Blood Collection Tube is used for clinical laboratory testing in coagulation.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
BD Vacutainer Citrate Blood Collection Tubes (BD Citrate Tubes) are for collection,
containment, transport, and centrifugation of venous blood. The blood collection tube consists of
a closure assembly (BD Hemogard Closure), a plastic configuration and a liquid additive (0.109
M buffered sodium citrate). The BD Citrate tubes are available with Hemogard Closure
Assembly which consists of a rubber stopper and protective plastic shield to reduce user
exposure to blood. The buffered sodium citrate solution prevents specimen coagulation. The
tubes are compatible with the BD Vacutainer Blood Collection Needles, Blood Collection Sets,
Transfer Devices, Holders, and Adaptors.

B Principle of Operation:
The BD Vacutainer Citrate Tubes are plastic, evacuated, and sterile (1.8 mL or 2.7 mL) tubes.
The tubes contain a buffered sodium citrate used to anti-coagulate whole blood for hematological
investigations. It acts as an extracorporeal anticoagulant by binding free calcium in the blood
which is a necessary co-factor to several steps in the clotting/coagulation cascade.
Anticoagulation with buffered sodium citrate is reversible with the addition of excess calcium.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
The study was conducted to evaluate the clinical performance of BD Vacutainer Citrate
Tubes (2.7 mL) for repeatability (within-tube), lot-to-lot and tube-to-tube variation in
comparison with Greiner Bio-One Vacuette Citrate Tubes (2.7 mL) for selected coagulation
parameters (PT, INR, aPTT, D-Dimer, and Anti-Factor Xa). Blood from sixty-five subjects
was collected into the study tubes, which consisted of three lots of each tube type. Samples
were tested for the coagulation parameters within 4 hours of collection at room temperature
on the STA Compact Max, Sysmex CS-2500 and Instrumentation Laboratory ACL TOP 750.
Performance of the BD Vacutainer Citrate Tubes for between-lot variation and between-tube
variation showed non inferiority for all tube comparisons for the coagulation parameters
tested on instrument platforms when compared with the comparator device.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Shelf-Life Stability
Shelf-life stability studies were conducted by using BD Vacutainer Citrate Tubes at 7 months
for 1.8 mL BD Citrate Tubes and at 10 months for 2.7 mL BD Citrate Tubes, respectively,
comparing with BD Vacutainer Citrate Tubes that were near manufacture date (<30 days).
The studies were conducted by testing selected routine coagulation parameters. Sixty-nine
normal and abnormal samples (on anticoagulants) were included in this study. The results
showed that the shelf-life for BD Citrate Tubes is 6 months (1.8 mL) and 9 months (2.7 mL)
when stored at 4–25 °C.
Within-Tube Stability
Within-tube stability was evaluated by using BD Vacutainer Citrate Tubes stored at room
temperature for routine coagulation parameters PT/INR, aPTT, Anti-Factor Xa and D-Dimer.
Sixty normal and abnormal (on anticoagulants) samples were tested at time zero (t0), 4 hours,
8 hours measuring Anti-Factor Xa, D-Dimer, PT/INR, and aPTT; Sixty-eight normal and
abnormal (on anticoagulants) samples were tested at 0, 16, and 24 hours measuring D-Dimer,
INR, and PT. The BD Vacutainer Citrate Tubes results showed clinical equivalence of
within-tube stability for PT/INR at 24 hours, D-Dimer at 16 hours, and aPTT, Anti-Factor Xa
at 8 hours. All analytes tested at every time point were tested at room temperature (15-25
°C).

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison study was conducted at five clinical sites including 219 participants
with 18 years of age or older. Fresh venous whole blood was collected into BD Vacutainer
Citrate Tubes (BD Citrate) and Greiner Bio-One Vacuette Citrated Tubes (Greiner Citrate).
Samples were tested for representative tests including, Prothrombin Time with International
Normalized Ratio (PT/INR), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT), D-Dimer, and
Anti-Factor Xa. An additional tube (Greiner K2EDTA) for hematocrit was drawn for study
eligibility. Participant populations included healthy/normal participants, patients on oral
anticoagulant therapy, and patients on unfractionated heparin. The study was tested on two
platforms (Diagnostica Stago STA Compact Max and Instrumentation Laboratory ACL
TOP). For each analyte on each platform, Deming or Passing-Bablok regression was used to
estimate average differences between the evaluation tube (BD Citrate) and comparator
(Greiner Citrate) tubes at the medically relevant points for each analyte on each platform.
The results are summarized in the following table:

A. Draw Volume Performance
The draw volume study is conducted to demonstrate functional draw volume
performance of BD Vacutainer Citrate tube products to confirm retention of vacuum by
comparing the results from the control at time zero (t0) to time points over the claimed
shelf-life. A sample size of n=90, evenly divided between each of the three product lots,
was collected at each test interval for each sterilization dose and storage condition. The
results showed that the BD Vacutainer Citrate Tubes (2.7 mL and 1.8 mL) met the draw
volume acceptance criteria for all intervals of accelerated aging to support a shelf life of 6
months (1.8 mL) and 9 months (2.7 mL).
B. Breakage Resistance During Drop and Centrifugation Testing
This study is conducted to demonstrate functional breakage resistance performance
during drop testing for plastic tubes and during centrifugation for plastic tubes.
Drop Breakage Resistance: The test article is filled, centrifuged, stored at frozen and
refrigerated temperatures, and then dropped from a set height. Samples are subsequently
inspected for breakage and leakage. A sample size of n=183, evenly divided between
each of the three (3) product lots, was collected at each test interval for each sterilization
dose and storage condition.

Centrifugation Breakage Resistance: The test article is filled, centrifuged, and
subsequently inspected for breakage and leakage. A sample size of n=300, evenly divided
between each of the three (3) product lots, was collected at each test interval for each
sterilization dose and storage condition.
The results showed that the BD Vacutainer Citrate Blood Collection tubes (1.8 mL and 2.7
mL) met the drop and centrifugation breakage acceptance criteria to support the current
claimed shelf life of 9 months for the BD Vacutainer 2.7 mL Citrate Blood Collection and 6
months for the BD Vacutainer 1.8 mL Citrate Blood Collection tube.
C. Stopper Pullout
Stopper Pullout testing is to demonstrate functional stopper performance in the event that
the stopper is removed from the tube to access the sample and then reinserted. 90 samples
were measured for First Stopper Pullout Force, and n=90 samples were measured for
Needle Withdrawal Force. Results demonstrate that the force holding the stopper in the
tube is greater than the force required to remove the collection needle from the stopper
during sample collection. Second Stopper Pullout testing is to demonstrate functional
stopper performance in the event that the stopper is removed from the tube to access the
sample and then reinserted. The tests confirmed the acceptance criteria was met.
D. Ship Testing
Ship testing was performed to evaluate packaging efficacy and safety during simulated
shipping and handling conditions. Shipping and handling were simulated for temperature
fluctuations, vibrations during shipping, and dropping. A sample size of at least n=30
shelf packs, evenly divided between each of the three (3) product lots, was collected. The
result demonstrated that all tubes (1.8 mL and 2.7 mL) met the Ship Testing acceptance
criteria. Results indicated no occurrence of damage from Ship Testing.
