III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
The Access TPO Antibody assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for
the quantitative determination of thyroperoxidase antibody (TPOAb) levels in human serum and
plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems.
The detection of TPOAb is an aid in the diagnosis of thyroid autoimmune disorders.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as Intended Use.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (K221225)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Each Access TPO Antibody reagent kit contains two reagent packs (50 tests/pack). Each pack
contains the following:
• R1a (3.25 mL): Dynabeads paramagnetic particles coated with streptavidin and coupled
to biotinylated human recombinant TPO in N-(2-acetamido)-2-
aminoethanesulfonic acid (ACES) buffer with protein (bovine) and
preservatives
• R1b (9.60 mL): Recombinant Protein A-alkaline phosphatase (bovine) conjugate in 2-
Morpholinoethanesulphonic acid (MES) buffer with protein (bovine)
and preservatives
• R1c (3.10 mL): TRIS buffer with protein (bovine) and preservatives
Materials needed but not supplied:
• Access TPO Antibody Calibrators: Six levels (0, 5, 20, 75, 300, and 1,000 IU/mL)
• Quality Control (QC) materials: commercial control material
• Substrate: Lumi-Phos PRO
• Unicel DxI Wash Buffer II
• Access Sample Diluent A (optional)
K240469 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
The modification of the Access TPO Antibody is to replace substrate (Lumi-Phos 530) of the
Access TPO Antibody with a new substrate (Lumi-Phos PRO) on the DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer.
B Principle of Operation:
The modified Access TPO Antibody assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic
(“sandwich”) assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel with paramagnetic particles coated
with human recombinant thyroperoxidase protein. The TPO antibody in serum or plasma binds
to thyroperoxidase on the solid phase. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to
the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate (Lumi-Phos PRO) is added to the vessel and light generated by the
reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the
concentration of TPO antibody in the sample. The amount of analyte concentration is
automatically determined from a stored calibration.

replicates per run, two runs per day for 20 days, resulting in 80 datapoints for each
sample per reagent lot per instrument. The data were analyzed for repeatability (within-

2. Linearity:
A linearity study of the modified Access TPO Antibody assay on the DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer was performed in accordance with CLSI EP06-Ed2. Five linearity
dilution series were prepared by mixing High and Low native serum samples. All dilution
series included nine dilution samples covering the ranges shown in the table below. For all
five series, the lowest samples were tested in replicates of eight, while all other samples were
tested in replicates of four on one DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer using one
modified Access TPO Antibody reagent lot. For each level, the mean of the measured values,
predicted value and the percent deviation from linearity were calculated. The data sets from
the five series were also combined for a single linearity analysis. The results are summarized
in the table below.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay reportable range for the Access TPO Antibody is the same as the claimed AMI:
0.25–1000 IU/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability:
The traceability was established in K061382. There is no change to the traceability of the
modified Access TPO Antibody.
b) Stability:
The Access TPO Antibody reagent kit and the Lumi-Phos PRO substrate are packaged
separately. Access TPO Antibody reagent kit stability was established in K061382. The
proposed change is to replace the substrate (Lumi-Phos 530) with a new substrate (Lumi-
Phos PRO) for the assay run on DxI Access Immunoassay Analyzer. The shelf-life claims
and on-board stability claims of Lumi-Phos PRO substrate were established in K221225.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the
modified Access TPO Antibody on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer were
determined based on the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
a) LoB:
The LoB was determined by testing five TPO antibody-depleted individual native serum
samples using two modified Access TPO Antibody reagent lots on two DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzers. Samples were run in five replicates per run, one run per day, for
three days on one DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer, resulting in 75 replicates for
one reagent lot on each instrument. LoB was defined as the value corresponding to the
95th percentile of the rank position of the distribution of values. This resulted in the LoB
values of 0.19 IU/mL and 0.14 IU/mL for two reagent lots. The claimed LoB for the
modified Access TPO Antibody on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.19
IU/mL.
b) LoD:
The LoD was determined by testing a minimum of five low level serum samples using
three modified Access TPO Antibody reagent lots on three DxI Access 9000
Immunoassay Analyzers. Samples were run in nine replicates per run, one run per day,
for five days for each reagent lot on each DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. The
LoD was calculated for each reagent lot based on LoB + “SD was multiplied by the 95th
percentile of the standard normal distribution” per CLSI EP17-A2. This resulted in LoD
values of 0.21, 0.21, and 0.23 IU/mL for three reagent lots. The claimed LoD for the
K240469 - Page 7 of 9

--- Page 8 ---
modified Access TPO Antibody assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is
0.23 IU/mL.
c) LoQ:
The LoQ was determined by testing a minimum of 13 low level serum samples using
three modified Access TPO Antibody reagent lots on three DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzers. Samples were run a minimum of nine replicates per run, one
run per day, for five days for each reagent lot on each DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
Analyzer. The estimated LoQ of the modified Access TPO antibody was set to be the
TPO antibody concentration which met the within-laboratory imprecision of 20%CV. The
claimed LoQ for the modified Access TPO Antibody assay on the DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.25 IU/mL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
An assay cut-off of 9 IU/mL was established in K061382.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
CLSI guideline EP09c, 3rd Edition was followed to compare the modified Access TPO
Antibody assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer to the predicate device, the
Access TPO Antibody assay on the Access 2 Immunoassay Analyzer. Samples falling within
the analytical measuring interval of both assays were evaluated. A total of 219 serum samples
(192 were native individual serum samples, 27 samples were pools of individual native
serum samples) were tested with six modified Access TPO Antibody reagent pack lots on six
DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzers (candidate), and six Access TPO Antibody reagent pack
lots on four Access 2 instruments (predicate). The comparison between paired measurements
was analyzed using Passing-Bablok method by fitting the observed modified Access TPO
Antibody on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (y) into a linear regression model,
with the observed value from the predicate (x). The results are summarized in the following
table:
