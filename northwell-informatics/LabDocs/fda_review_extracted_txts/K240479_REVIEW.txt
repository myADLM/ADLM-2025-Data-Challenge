See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access OV Monitor assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for
the quantitative determination of CA 125 antigen levels in human serum and plasma using the
Access Immunoassay Systems. This device is indicated for use in the measurement of CA 125
antigen to aid in the management of ovarian cancer patients. Serial testing for patient CA 125
antigen concentrations should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods used for
monitoring ovarian cancer.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
The Instruction for Use of the device contains the following warnings:
The concentration of CA 125 antigen in a given specimen determined with assays from different
manufacturers can vary due to differences in assay methods and reagent specificity. The results
reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the CA 125 antigen assay
used. Values obtained with different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably. If, in the
course of monitoring a patient, the assay method used for determining CA 125 antigen values is
changed, additional sequential testing should be carried out to confirm baseline values.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (K221225)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Each Access OV Monitor Reagent Pack contains two reagent packs (50 tests/pack). Each pack
contains the following:
• Paramagnetic particles, coated with goat anti-biotin antibodies, biotinylated anti CA 125
antigen mouse monoclonal antibodies, bovine serum albumin, < 0.1% sodium azide, and
0.1% ProClin 300.
• Mouse monoclonal anti-CA 125 antigen-alkaline phosphatase (bovine) conjugate, bovine
serum albumin, < 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.1% ProClin 300.
• Buffered protein solution (bovine, goat, mouse), < 0.1% sodium azide and 0.1% ProClin
300.
Materials needed but not supplied with reagent kit:
• Access OV Monitor Calibrators: at approximately 0, 25, 100, 500, 2,000 and 5,000 U/mL
• Quality Control (QC) materials: commercial control material
• Substrate: Lumi-Phos PRO
K240479 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
• UniCel DxI Wash Buffer II
• Access Sample Diluent A (optional)
The modification of the Access OV Monitor includes:
(a) a new substrate replacement (Lumi-Phos PRO)
(b) run on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer with updated analytical measuring interval
of 2.0 – 5,000 U/mL
B Principle of Operation:
The Access OV Monitor assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A sample is
added to a reaction vessel along with mouse monoclonal anti-CA 125 antigen alkaline
phosphatase conjugate and paramagnetic particles coated with a second mouse monoclonal anti-
CA 125 antigen antibody. The CA 125 antigen in the sample binds to the immobilized
monoclonal anti-CA 125 antigen on the solid phase, while the conjugate antibody reacts with a
different antigenic site on the CA 125 antigen molecule. After incubation, materials bound to the
solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured
with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte
in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically determined from a stored calibration.

2. Linearity:
a) Linearity studies:
Linearity of the modified Access OV Monitor was performed in accordance with CLSI
guideline EP06 2nd Edition. Two series of High samples were prepared by pooling human
serum samples to achieve CA 125 concentrations of 360 U/mL (Sample-1) and 6,162
U/mL (Sample-2). Low sample was obtained from a single human serum sample that was
specifically stripped of CA 125 antigen using paramagnetic particles to achieve a
concentration below the low end of the AMI of the assay. The low sample in the two
series was run in replicates of eight, and all other dilution levels were run in replicates of
four, and the ‘measured value’ (mean CA 125 U/mL) was compared to its predicted value
for deviation percentage using a weighted linear regression analysis. This deviation was
then compared to the allowable deviation from linearity (ADL). The results are
summarized in table below.

* Combined from Sample 1 and 2
** % Deviation from Linearity for concentrations > 15 U/mL
The data support the linearity interval from 0.5 to 6,162 U/mL with the deviations from
linearity within ±10%. The study results support the linearity of the claimed analytical
measuring interval (AMI): 2.0 – 5,000 U/mL.

b) Extended Measuring Interval (Auto Dilution):
Extended measuring range study was conducted in accordance with CLSI guideline
EP34, 1st Edition. A total of five individual human serum samples spiked with antigen to
achieve doses within the extended measuring interval (EMI) of the assay concentrations
between 8,000 U/mL and 100,000 U/mL. Two operators each prepared two independent
1:20 manual dilutions for each sample. Manual dilutions and dilutions performed by two
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers were done with one Access OV Monitor
reagent lot. Recovery results for dilution factor at 1:20 for samples with concentrations
between 8,015 U/mL up to 83,361 U/mL are between 94% and 99%. These results
showed that the dilution at 1:20 performed by the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
Analyzer are consistent with manual dilutions.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a) Endogenous/Exogenous Substance Interference
Refer to K023597
b) Carryover
Carryover was established in K221225.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range is the same as the claimed analytical measuring interval (AMI): 2.0 –
5,000 U/mL. The device allows auto-dilution of samples—the extended measuring interval
(EMI) ‘upper limit of quantitation’ (ULOQ to the maximum dilution concentration) is
100,000 U/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability:
The traceability was established in K023597.
b) Stability:
The Access OV Monitor Reagent kit and the Lumi-Phos PRO substrate are packaged
separately. Access OV Monitor Reagent kit stability was established in K023597. The
proposed change is to replace substrate (Lumi-Phos 530) of the modified Access OV
Monitor with a new substrate (Lumi-Phos PRO). The shelf-life claims and on-board
stability claims of Lumi-Phos PRO substrate were established in K221225.

6. Detection Capability:
CLSI guideline EP17-A2 was followed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of
Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the modified Access OV Monitor on
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer.
a) LoB:
Five blank samples (individual native serum samples from which CA 125 was
specifically depleted) were tested in five replicates per run, one run per day over three
days using two modified Access OV Monitor reagent lots (N = 75 replicates for each lot)
on two DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers. The LoB for each reagent lot was
calculated using the non-parametric approach and the maximum observed LoB is taken as
the reported value for the measurement procedure. LoB determined using the 95% non-
parametric percentile of the replicates for each of the two reagent lots was 0.2 U/mL. The
claimed LoB for the modified Access OV Monitor on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
Analyzer is 0.5 U/mL.
b) LoD:
Seven serum samples containing low levels of CA 125 were run in eight to nine
replicates per run, one run per day over five days using three modified Access OV
Monitor reagent lots (N = minimum 280 replicates for each lot) on two DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzers. The LoD was determined by fitting the precision profile model
between within-laboratory SD and concentration. LoD calculated from LoB + “SD
multiplied by the 95th percentile of the standard normal distribution” resulted in 0.3
U/mL for each reagent lot. The claimed LoD for the modified Access OV Monitor on
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.7 U/mL.
c) LoQ:
A minimum of 13 serum samples containing low levels of CA 125 were run in nine
replicates of per run, one run per day over five days using three modified Access OV
Monitor reagent lots (N=minimum 585 replicates for each lot) on three DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzers. A variance components model was used to estimate the within-
run and within-laboratory (total) %CV for each sample on each instrument and reagent
lot combination. The estimated LoQ of the modified Access OV Monitor within-
laboratory imprecision of 20% CV resulted in 0.3 U/mL. The claimed LoQ for the
modified Access OV Monitor on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 2.0 U/mL.

CLSI guideline EP09c 3rd Edition was followed to compare the modified Access OV Monitor
on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer to the predicate device, the Access OV Monitor
on the Access 2 Immunoassay System. Patient samples falling within the analytical
measuring interval of the Access OV Monitor assay were evaluated. A total of 152 serum
samples were tested with three Access OV Monitor reagent lots and three calibrator lots, on
three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers (candidate) and three Access 2 instruments
(predicate). Three commercial quality controls were run in duplicate each day to verify the
systems were in control. The comparison between paired measurements was analyzed using
Passing-Bablok method by fitting the observed modified Access OV Monitor Assay on DxI
9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (dependent variable, y) into a linear regression model,
with the observed values from the predicate (x, predicate). The results are summarized in the
