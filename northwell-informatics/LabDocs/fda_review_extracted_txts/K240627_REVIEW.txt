C Type of Test:
A multiplexed nucleic acid test intended for use with the automated LIAISON PLEX instrument
for the qualitative in vitro detection and identification of nucleic acid from yeast in a positive
blood culture media sample that demonstrates the presence of fungi as determined by Gram
stain.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The LIAISON PLEX Yeast Blood Culture (BCY) Assay is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex in
vitro diagnostic test intended for use on the LIAISON PLEX System for simultaneous detection
and identification of multiple potentially pathogenic fungal organisms in positive blood culture.
The LIAISON PLEX BCY Assay is performed directly on blood culture samples identified as
positive by a continuous monitoring blood culture system and which contain fungal organisms as
determined by Gram Stain.
The LIAISON PLEX BCY Assay detects and identifies the following fungal organisms:
Candida albicans
Candida auris
Candida dubliniensis
Candida famata
Candida glabrata
Candida guilliermondii
Candida kefyr
Candida krusei
Candida lipolytica
Candida lusitaniae
Candida parapsilosis
Candida tropicalis
Candida haemulonii / duobushaemulonii
Cryptococcus neoformans / gattii
The detection and identification of specific fungal nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs
and/or symptoms of bloodstream infection aids in the diagnosis of bloodstream infection when
used in conjunction with other clinical information. The results from LIAISON PLEX BCY
Assay are intended to be interpreted in conjunction with Gram stain results and should not be
used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.
Negative results in the setting of a suspected bloodstream infection may be due to infection with
pathogens that are not detected by this test. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with
other organisms; the organism(s) detected by LIAISON PLEX BCY Assay may not be the
definite cause of disease. Additional laboratory testing (e.g. sub-culturing of positive blood
cultures for identification of organisms not detected by LIAISON PLEX BCY Assay,
susceptibility testing and differentiation of mixed growth) and clinical presentation must be taken
into consideration in the final diagnosis of bloodstream infection.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The LIAISON PLEX Yeast Blood Assay (BCY Assay) is an automated test for the detection and
identification of nucleic acids from yeast in a positive blood culture media sample. The
LIAISON PLEX BCY Assay is performed directly on blood culture media using blood culture
bottles identified as positive by a continuous monitoring blood culture system, and which contain
a fungal organism, as determined by Gram stain. The LIAISON PLEX BCY Assay is performed
on the LIAISON PLEX System. The LIAISON PLEX System is a fully automated, benchtop
device that performs sample preparation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and microarray-
based hybridization for the detection of target-specific nucleic acids. The LIAISON PLEX BCY
Assay components required to perform the test include the following single-use, disposables:
• LIAISON PLEX BCY Assay Test Cartridge
• LIAISON PLEX BCY Assay Transfer Pipettes (or equivalent)
The test reagents are supplied in a single, disposable test cartridge. The LIAISON PLEX BCY
Assay has 14 different reportable targets. Reporting of these targets is based on detection of one
or more of the nucleic acid targets. Results can be:
• reviewed by the user on the touch screen,
• exported to a USB flash drive,
• printed, or submitted to a Laboratory Information System (LIS) for reporting.
The LIAISON PLEX System automates the BCY Assay sample analysis through the following
steps: 1) Sample Preparation, 2) Amplification, and 3) Hybridization., and 4) Signal Analysis.
The image analysis of the microarray provides light signal intensities from the target-specific
capture spots, as well as the negative control, background, and imaging control spots.
B Principle of Operation:
The assay workflow is as follows:
1. The user adds the sample into the cartridge via a pipette and closes the cartridge sample port.
2. The user creates a new order and scans or manually enters the sample ID.
3. The user scans the assay cartridge barcode with the hand-held barcode reader.
K240627 - Page 3 of 45

--- Page 4 ---
4. The user inserts the assay cartridge into the open bay that the instrument identifies based on
the number of runs, and then initiates the run.
5. This is repeated, as needed, for up to six cartridges.
6. Next, the system scans the barcode located on the top of the cartridge and automatically
configures to perform the appropriate assay based on the unique barcode on the cartridge.
The following steps take place within the closed cartridge:
1. Sample Preparation - The sample is mixed with reagents and nucleic acid extraction occurs
via mechanical and chemical cell lysis and magnetic bead-based nucleic acid isolation. The
sample then goes through a series of washes to capture and purify the nucleic acid. The
nucleic acid is then transferred into the PCR module.
2. Amplification - The LIAISON PLEX System initiates an amplification process, which heats
and cools the PCR tubes for replication of the extracted nucleic acid to generate target
specific amplicons.
3. Hybridization - Nucleic acid is transferred by the LIAISON PLEX System to the
hybridization unit. Here, amplified DNA hybridizes to specific capture DNA arrayed on a
glass slide in a microarray format and the bound target DNA, in turn, hybridizes with
mediator and gold-nanoparticle probes. An image of the hybridization unit is taken and the
LIAISON PLEX Software performs data analysis.
4. Signal Analysis - Gold nanoparticle probes bound specifically to target-containing spots in
the microarray are silver-enhanced, and light scatter from the spots is measured and further
analyzed to determine the presence (Detected) or absence (Not Detected) of a target.
The system completes all necessary steps for the assay. No user intervention is necessary once
the run is initiated. Once the run is complete, the user removes the cartridge(s) and disposes of
them in the appropriate waste container.
Following a series of quality control checks a final call is made for the Target: Detected if the
Target signal is above threshold and Not Detected otherwise. Failure of any quality control
checks results in a “No Call” result.

VII Performance Characteristics:
A Analytical Performance:
1. Reproducibility/Precision:
a. Site-to-Site Reproducibility
Reproducibility of the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay was evaluated at three different sites
(one internal, two external) using replicates of four blinded panels (Table 1) representing
a subset of targets detected by the assay. The four panels consisted of a negative sample,
a negative sample contrived with an off-panel organism, a multi-analyte panel of targets
at ring positive low positive concentrations, and a multi-analyte panel of targets at ring
positive plus 8 hour blood culture moderate positive concentrations. “Ring Positive”
represents when a blood culture bottle is indicated as positive when incubating in an
automated blood culture system. “Ring Positive + 8 hour” represents when a blood
culture bottle is allowed to incubate in an automated blood culture system for at least 8
hours beyond ring positivity (See Growth and Detection Study for more information). All
panels were diluted into negative blood matrix. Negative blood matrix is media from a
blood culture bottle spiked with whole blood and incubated for at least five days in an
automated blood culture system and confirmed to be negative by the absence of growth
on an appropriate nutrient agar plate. The study incorporated potential sources of
variation introduced by site, day, and operator. Three replicates of each panel were
evaluated once per day over five non-consecutive days for a total of 90 replicates per
panel member (3 sites x 5 days x 2 Operators x 3 replicates = 90 replicates). A single lot

evaluated organisms. The Ring Positive concentration gave expected results 100% of the
time for Candida tropicalis and Candida neoformans and 98.9% of the time for Candida
albicans. The Ring Positive + 8 hour concentration yielded expected results 100% of the
tested organisms. The results of the reproducibility study are acceptable.
b. Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility
Lot-to-lot reproducibility of the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay was evaluated using one
operator at a single site testing three unique lots over five non-consecutive days. The
same four panels used to evaluate site-to-site reproducibility were used in the lot-to-lot
reproducibility assessments. Each panel member was tested in triplicate once per day on
five different days generating a total of 45 replicates per panel member (1 Site x 1

Lot-to-lot Reproducibility testing demonstrated 100% positive agreement with expected
results for evaluated LIAISON PLEX BCY assay targets (Candida albicans, Candida
tropicalis, and Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii) at ring positivity and ring positivity + 8
hours, as well as 100% negative agreement with expected results for the negative sample
with no spiked organism (i.e., negative blood matrix) and the contrived negative sample
containing an off-panel analyte (i.e., Escherichia coli). The results of these studies are
acceptable.
c. Within-Laboratory Precision
The within-laboratory precision/repeatability of the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay was
assessed using two operators, two instruments, and a single lot of reagents over five non-
consecutive days. The sample panel members described in the site-to-site reproducibility
section above were used. Data from this study are presented in Table 4.

Within-laboratory precision/repeatability testing demonstrated 100% positive agreement
with expected results for the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay targets evaluated (Candida
albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii) at ring positivity and
ring positivity + 8 hours, as well as 100% negative agreement with expected results for
the unspiked negative sample (i.e. negative blood matrix) in addition to the contrived
negative sample containing off-panel analytes (i.e. Escherichia coli). The results of these
studies are acceptable.
2. Linearity:
Not applicable, the assay is qualitative.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a. Analytical Specificity (Cross-Reactivity)
i. Laboratory Testing
This study evaluated the analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) of the LIAISON
PLEX BCY assay in the presence of non-targeted microorganisms that may be
found in clinical blood culture samples. A total of 77 off-panel organisms (40 off-
panel bacterial species and 37 off-panel yeast species) were evaluated in the
study. The potentially cross-reacting organisms were spiked into negative blood
matrix for all targets on the assay and tested in triplicate in triplicate in the
absence of the target organisms. Bacterial organisms were tested at concentrations
≥ 1.00E+08 CFU/mL (or equivalent) and yeast organisms were tested at ≥
1.00E+07 CFU/mL (or equivalent), or the highest available concentration. Of the
40 bacterial species tested no cross-reactivity was observed at the concentrations
tested (Table 5). One of three replicates was positive for the on-panel organisms

Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis when the bacterium Klebsiella
pneumoniae (ATCC-BAA 2146) was present. Additional testing with six
replicates of Klebsiella pneumoniae did not result in any positive results which
resulted in 11% positivity (1/9 total replicates) of K. pneumoniae at a
concentration of 1.0E+08 CFU/mL.
Of the 37 yeast species tested, 35 organisms had no cross-reactivity with on-panel
organisms (Table 6). Trichosporon asteroides (CBS-KNAW) generated positive
results for on-panel organisms Candida glabrata (3/3 replicates) and Candida
haemulonii/duobushaemulonii (2/3 replicates) during initial testing. Root cause
analysis determined the stock material used to prepare the T. asteroides samples
were contaminated with C. glabrata and C. haemulonii/duobushaemulonii, and
additional testing with 3 replicates from a freshly prepared stock of T. asteroides
did not produce any positive results. Yarrowia deformans (NRRL Y-63659)
cross-reacted and had 100% detection for the BCY target Candida lipolytica
when tested at a concentration of 1.0E+07 CFU/mL. The concentration of Y.
deformans was lowered to 1.0E+04 CFU/mL and tested, cross-reactivity was not
observed at this lower concentration. Candida pseudohaemulonii (CBS-KNAW
10004) cross-reacted and had 100% detection for the BCY target Candida
haemulonii/duobushaemulonii when tested at 1.0E+07 CFU/mL. Six additional
replicates of C. pseudohaemulonii were tested and demonstrated 100% detection
of the on-panel target C. haemulonii/duobushaemulonii. The concentration of C.
pseudohaemulonii was lowered to 1.0E+02 CFU/mL and tested, cross-reactivity
was not observed at this lower concentration. During the first round of retesting of
C. pseudohaemulonii 1/6 replicates was positive for the on-panel target Candida
lusitaniae. Root cause analysis determined the use of C. lusitaniae prior to testing
in the same area contributed to the positive result. Cross-reactive organisms
identified in this assessment are noted in the device labeling.

ii. In silico Testing
In silico analysis of assay specificity/exclusivity was performed by conducting a
BLAST comparison of assay oligo sequences to the GenBank nt sequence
database, as of December 28, 2023. Sequences for the organisms listed in Table 7
were evaluated for potential cross-reactivity. Sequences for all on-panel
organisms were included to evaluate intra-panel cross-reactivity. In silico
exclusivity analysis of potential non-specific amplification and detection indicates
the following potential cross-reactivity against organisms listed in Table 7:
• The Candida lipolytica oligo designs are predicted to detect Yarrowia
deformans strains resulting in false positive results.
• The Candida haemulonii/duobushamulonii oligo designs are predicted to
detect Candida pseudohaemulonii strains resulting in false positive results.

Organisms in bold were cross reactive with on-panel targets during laboratory exclusivity testing.
Cross-reactivity of Y. deformans and C. pseudohaemulonii with LIAISON PLEX BCY
assay target oligos identified in the in silico analyses was confirmed by wet testing in the
Analytical Specificity study and identified cross-reactive organisms are noted in the
device labeling.
b. Microbial Interference/Competitive Inhibition
To determine if non-target organisms can interfere with detection of on-panel organisms
in the same sample, a microbial interference study was conducted. To simulate co-
infection the study evaluated 33 pair-wise combinations of a low concentration (ring
positive) on-panel target and potentially interfering off-panel organisms at high

concentration (1.0E+08 CFU/mL). To evaluate competitive inhibition pair-wise
combinations of a low-concentration on-panel target and a second on-panel target at high
concentration (ring positive + 8 hours) were also evaluated. The three on-panel targets
selected for these evaluations are representative of the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay
targets and chosen based on global prevalence. Off-panel organisms were also selected
for their clinical prevalence and likelihood of being present in blood samples. Testing for
all studies was performed in triplicate and results of the microbial interference study and
competitive inhibition study are presented in Tables 8 and 9, respectively. Competitive
Inhibition was not observed for the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay when low concentration
on-panel organisms are tested in the presence of high concentration interfering microbes
and other on-panel organisms and the results are acceptable.

c. Interfering Substances
An analytical study was performed to assess the potential inhibitory effects of 18
exogenous and endogenous substances that may be commonly found in blood samples
(Table 10). Representative target organisms (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus
neoformans, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida guilliermondii, and
Candida kefyr) were tested at ring positive concentrations in negative blood matrix. A
panel containing negative blood matrix was also tested to assess the risk of false positive
results in the presence of potentially interfering substances. All organisms were tested
using five replicates. No interference was observed except for the C.
albicans/Fluconazole 25 mg/L combination. During initial testing of Fluconazole one
replicate (1/5) did not detect Candida albicans. Dilution of Fluconazole from 25 mg/L to
8.3 mg/L resulted in 100% detection of C. albicans. Potential LIAISON PLEX BCY
assay interference by Fluconazole at 25 mg/L is noted in the device labeling. These
results from the interfering substances study are acceptable.

i. Internal Controls:
Each BCY Assay cartridge includes internal controls that monitor performance of
each step of the testing process, including sample preparation, amplification, and
detection of targets. The internal control is added to the sample automatically
prior to initiation of sample preparation. A post-amplification hybridization
control serves as a proxy for hybridization success. Internal control results are
reported as Pass or Fail on printed result reports (Table 11).

ii. Recommended External Control:
External controls are not provided with the BCY Assay but are recommended in
the package insert. Positive and negative external controls should be tested with
each new lot of reagents or monthly, whichever occurs first. Blood culture
medium can be used as the negative control. Previously characterized positive
samples or blood culture medium spiked with well characterized organisms can
be used as the external positive control. External controls should be run in
accordance with laboratory protocols and accrediting organizations, as applicable.
b. Sample Stability
A sample stability study was performed to establish the recommended storage conditions
for positive blood cultures prior to testing with the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay. Two
representative panels, each containing three LIAISON PLEX BCY assay target
organisms (Panel A - Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida
tropicalis and Panel B - Candida glabrata, Candida guilliermondii, and Candida kefyr)
were prepared at concentrations approximating ring positivity and were stored at -80
±15°C, 2-8°C, and 33-37°C temperature over various time points (Table 12).
Additionally, sample stability was compared at ring positivity and 12 hours after ring
positivity. Panel organisms were selected to represent both genera of yeast detected by
the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay and a diverse fungal target panel. Twenty replicates
were tested at the beginning of the study using freshly made panels (time point T0). Ten
replicates were tested for each subsequent temperature and time point. The results of the
stability study are presented in Tables 13-16 below.

positive + 8 hours, and six replicates at ring positive -10-fold dilution (representative of a
near-LoD sample concentration). Representative organisms were selected to encompass
all three PCR pools of the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay cartridge and represented the
majority of the reportable targets detectable by the assay. Each target organism was
evaluated at three conditions, fresh, first freeze thaw, and second freeze thaw. The
positive agreement with the fresh condition at each freeze-thaw cycle demonstrated 100%
positive agreement at each condition (Table 17).

Results from the freeze-thaw study are acceptable and demonstrate that the LIAISON
PLEX BCY assay can detect organisms in samples that have been frozen and thawed up
to two times.
d. Carryover
An analytical study was performed to assess potential carryover or cross-contamination
in the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay by testing high positive and negative samples in an
alternating pattern on the LIAISON PLEX instrument. The high positive sample
consisted of Candida lusitaniae grown to ring positive + eight hours at a concentration of
1.3E+08 CFU/mL; the negative control samples were negative blood matrix. The study
was performed by two operators, each using one of two LIAISON PLEX instruments,
each containing six modules. Alternating high positive and negative samples were
evaluated per the format summarized in Table 18. A total of 30 high positive and 30
negative samples were evaluated. All high positive samples produced positive results,
while all negative samples were negative. These results support there is no evidence of
carryover from samples tested with the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay.

6. Detection Limit:
a. Limit of Detection
A limit of detection (LoD) study was performed to assess the analytical sensitivity of the
LIAISON PLEX BCY assay. Two strains for each of the 14 target organisms were
evaluated in negative blood matrix. The preliminary LoD for each strain was determined
using a 6-point 3-fold dilution series and four replicates of each dilution. The preliminary
LoD for each target was defined as the lowest concentration at which 100% of replicates
were positive for the intended target. The LoD was confirmed using 20 replicates of a 3-
point 3-fold dilution series around the preliminary LoD for each strain. The confirmed
LoD was defined as the lowest concentration at which ≥95% (19/20) of replicates tested
positive for the intended reportable target. If ≥95% (19/20) of replicates at a particular
concentration tested positive, a sample dilution with a three-fold lower concentration was
tested until the detection rate was <95%. The confirmed LoDs for the LIAISON PLEX
BCY assay targets are presented in Table 19.

b. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
The inclusivity of the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay was evaluated using contrived
samples containing fungal isolates that were selected to represent phylogenetic,
geographic, and temporal diversity of the organisms detected by the panel. The
inclusivity panel was comprised of 80 strains representing all 14 reportable targets. Assay
performance at bacterial concentrations representative of bottle positivity (ring positive)
was assessed with five strains. Bottle positivity concentrations for each strain were
determined in the Growth & Detection study (see section 6.d.). The inclusivity panel
strains and the concentration for which they were detected are presented in Table 20.

1Debaryomyces hansenii is a synonymous taxon name for Candida famata.
2 The stock concentration of Clavispora lusitaniae (Zeptometrix 801603) was not concentrated enough to
achieve the representative bottle positivity concentration. This preparation was prepared as stock material diluted
1:1 in negative blood matrix which is allowed per protocol directive.
The results from this study demonstrate the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay is capable of
detecting multiple clinically relevant strains of each target organism.

c. In silico Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
The inclusivity of the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay was further assessed using in silico
analysis of the oligonucleotides (i.e., forward primer(s), reverse primer(s), capture and
mediator probe(s)) for all assay targets in relation to sequences available in the NCBI
GenBank nt database. Sequence alignments were generated using a publicly available
sequence alignment program. The in silico analysis determined the percent homology of
each oligo sequence to its binding region on each target sequence retrieved from public
databases. A match (i.e., predicted reactivity) was based on the following criteria, >90%
homology between the oligo and reference sequences. To determine oligo homology, the
highest percent homology of each oligo in the same component was assessed and then the
lowest percent identity of the four components (forward primer, reverse primer, mediator,
and capture) was used to characterize the inclusivity of the sequence. A summary of in-
silico analysis results is provided below in Table 21.

d. Growth and Detection Study
A growth and detection study was conducted to establish the range of expected organism
concentrations present in incubated blood cultures at bottle positivity (i.e., ring positive)
and eight hours after ring positive. Fourteen organisms representing the LIAISON PLEX
BCY assay reportable targets were cultivated to ring positive and eight hours after ring
positivity using a continuous monitoring blood culture system. Three unique blood
bottles were used to assess ring positive growth and ring positive + eight hours for a total
of six bottles per organism. For each growth condition, all three blood bottles were
removed from the incubator within two hours of being identified as ring positive or
between 8 and 12 hours after Ring Positivity and counted in CFU/mL. In addition to
CFU/mL quantitation, a minimum of one ring positive bottle and one ring positive +
eight hours bottle from each target organism were tested in triplicate on the LIAISON
PLEX BCY assay. For several organisms a minimum of one ring positive bottle and one
ring positive + eight hours bottle was frozen at -80°C prior to testing on the LIAISON
PLEX BCY assay. Results from the growth and detection study are presented in Table 22
and represent approximate organism levels that may be observed in a clinical setting. All
quantified bottle positivity concentrations are equivalent or greater than the established
limit of detection for each the targets of the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay and the results
are acceptable.

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The LIAISON PLEX BCY assay determines the presence/absence of each target analyte (and
control) by comparing the mean signal intensity of capture spots to pre-defined thresholds. In
addition to the capture spot thresholds, a set of assay-dependent parameters are used to
evaluate the validity of the run. To determine the threshold and parameter values, a
sequential, multi-step approach was employed.
In the first step, a threshold training set consisting of 1293 samples from analytical testing
was used to estimate the thresholds and assay-dependent parameters. Proposed threshold and
assay-dependent parameter values were determined by their ability to distinguish between
true and false target calls while minimizing the no call rate. The proposed thresholds were
determined by the negative signal distribution, where no target is present in the samples.
In the second step of threshold determination, the performance of the proposed parameter and
threshold values from step 1 were evaluated using the threshold test set, which consisted of
92 samples from analytical testing which did not overlap with the threshold training set. The
true call vs. no call rate for performance parameters and controls, and reportable target

Bottle Type Equivalency Study
This study was designed to evaluate equivalence of 12 different blood culture bottle matrices
from three different blood culture systems on LIAISON PLEX BCY assay performance. Ten
percent of bottles from two lots of each bottle type were screened for contamination prior to
inclusion in the study. After screening, each bottle matrix was inoculated with either of two
positive contrived panels, bacterial strains (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli,
Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; selected for
their clinical prevalence in blood infections) or incubated without inoculation for 5-7 days to
make negative blood matrix (NBM) (Table 23). Five replicates of each organism were tested
in each of two bottle lots. Yeasts for each positive contrived sample were prepared at a
concentration approximating blood culture bottle positivity in a clinical sample. Study results
are presented in Table 24.

Eleven bottle types tested demonstrated no detectable interference for any of the targets
evaluated. Two lots of the Bactec Plus Standard Anaerobic/F bottle type gave false positive
results for Candida tropicalis during the screen phase of the study. An additional lot was
screened, and negative results were observed for all on-panel organisms, but showed a low,
sub-threshold signal for C. tropicalis. Subsequent testing in the bottle type equivalency study
showed C. tropicalis contamination was detected in negative blood matrix testing (1/5
replicates). No growth occurred on the check plates and root cause analysis identified the
bottle media was contaminated with C. tropicalis nucleic acids. The 12 bottle types evaluated
in the bottle type equivalency study demonstrated correct positive and negative agreement
with the exception of the Bactec Plus Standard Anaerobic/F bottle type which resulted in one
C. tropicalis false positive. The results of this study are acceptable.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Prospective Clinical Study:
The clinical performance of the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay to detect and identify target
fungal pathogens from blood samples identified as 1) positive by a continuous monitoring
blood culture system, and 2) a Gram stain indicative of a fungal organism, was assessed in a
multi-site study using prospective samples. Device testing occurred at four geographically
diverse sites within the U.S. representative of the clinical laboratory intended use
environment. Prospective samples meeting study inclusion criteria were collected between
June 2023 and October 2023. Samples were stored either refrigerated (2-8°C) if tested within
24 hours, or frozen (≤ -70°C) if not tested within 24 hours of collection. Due to the low
prevalence of prospective positive fungal blood cultures, the study was supplemented with
retrospective and contrived samples. LIAISON PLEX BCY assay clinical performance was
compared with standard of care culture followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry results.
Discordant results analysis for applicable targets were performed by an FDA-cleared
molecular assay testing and reported as footnotes in the clinical performance tables.
A total of 3447 prospective blood samples identified as positive by a continuously monitored
blood culture system. Of these, 70 samples were identified as exhibiting yeast morphology
following Gram stain and were enrolled in the study. One sample was excluded following
enrollment due to inconclusive Gram stain results leaving 69 clinical samples for subsequent
analysis of the prospective clinical data set. Prospective samples were tested either fresh

Of the 69 clinical samples included in the prospective study analysis, 67 (97.1%) generated
valid LIAISON PLEX BCY assay results (i.e., Detected or Not Detected) on the first attempt.
Two samples (2.9%) with initial invalid results generated valid LIAISON PLEX BCY assay
results after a single retest for a final success rate of 100% (69/69).
The positive percent agreement (PPA) was calculated by dividing the number of true positive
(TP) results by the sum of TP and false negative (FN) results, while negative percent
agreement (NPA) was calculated by dividing the number of true negative (TN) results by the

1The one Candida albicans False Positive sample was also positive by an FDA-cleared molecular assay.
2The one Candida parapsilosis False Positive sample was also positive by an FDA-cleared molecular assay.
3One out of the three Candida tropicalis False Positive samples was also positive by an FDA-cleared molecular
assay.
The PPA of the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay was 100% across all analytes in prospectively
collected samples. The limited number of positive blood culture samples which contained a
fungal organism as determined by Gram stain required supplementation with archived
(Category III samples) and contrived (Category IV samples) to obtain more robust
performance estimates. The NPA for all organisms was >98% in prospectively collected
samples with the exception of Candida tropicalis which had an NPA of 95.2%. Discordant
analysis testing provided evidence for the presence of C. tropicalis in one out of three C.
tropicalis false positive results.
The LIAISON PLEX BCY assay reported multiple organism detections (co-infections) in a
total of six prospective samples. This represents 8.7% (6/69) of all prospective samples. All
six co-infections contained two organisms. Out of the six samples with multiple detections,
16.7% (1/6) was concordant with the reference method and 83.3% (5/6) contained one
organism that was not detected by the reference method (Table 27).

2. Retrospective Sample Evaluation:
Several targets detected by the LIAISON PLEX BCA assay were not encountered during the
prospective clinical study in sufficient numbers to demonstrate assay performance.
Therefore, the prospective clinical study was supplemented with additional testing using
retrospective positive samples characterized previously by a standard of care molecular
assay. To minimize bias, negative retrospective samples (N=13) were tested concurrently
with positive retrospective samples (N=50) obtained from six sources within the U.S. for a
total of 63 retrospective samples evaluated. All samples were randomized and blinded by an
individual not directly involved in the study testing. A summary of the demographic
information available for retrospective samples is presented in Table 28.

3. Contrived Sample Evaluation:
Due to the low prevalence of some of the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay target organisms
encountered during prospective and retrospective sample collection, contrived samples were
used to supplement clinical performance. Contrived samples were prepared from multiple
strains of each of the yeast organisms detected by the assay (Table 30). Blood culture bottles
containing whole blood from unique patients were inoculated with low inoculum
concentrations of individual isolates and grown until flagged positive (ring positive) by a
continuous monitoring blood culture system. Samples were collected within eight hours of
ring positivity and stored frozen until testing. Fifty contrived samples were evaluated for
each LIAISON PLEX BCY assay target. A total of 750 contrived samples and 79 negative
samples were randomized, blinded, and interspersed at the four clinical sites for testing with
prospective and retrospective samples.
Of the 829 contrived samples evaluated, 803 (96.9%) generated valid LIAISON PLEX BCY
assay results on the first attempt. Invalid results were obtained for 26 (3.1%) samples at first
attempt. Twenty-four of these samples generated a valid result after retest leading to a final
success rate of 99.7% (827/829). The results of contrived sample testing with the LIAISON
PLEX BCY assay are presented in Table 31.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The LIAISON PLEX BCY assay prospective clinical study was conducted to evaluate clinical
performance of the device using positive blood culture samples. A total of 3447 blood culture
samples identified as positive by a continuous monitoring blood culture system were collected
across four geographically diverse clinical sites within the U.S. between June and October of
2023. Prospective samples were tested with the LIAISON PLEX BCY assay either fresh or
frozen. Of the 3447 samples, 69 samples met inclusion criteria and exhibited yeast morphology
