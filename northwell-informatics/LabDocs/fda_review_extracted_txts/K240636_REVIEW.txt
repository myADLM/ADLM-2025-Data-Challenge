The HemoScreen is a point-of-care (POC) automated hematology analyzer intended for the
enumeration and classification of the following parameters in capillary and venous whole blood
(K2EDTA anticoagulated): WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, PLT, MPV,
NEUT%, NEUT#, LYMP%, LYMP#, MONO%, MONO#, EO%, EO#, BASO%, and BASO#.
The HemoScreen is for in vitro diagnostic use in clinical laboratories and/or POC settings for
adults and children at least 2 years of age.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The HemoScreen is a point-of-care (POC), automated hematology analyzer that provides results
for complete blood count (CBC) parameters and a 5-part leukocyte differential, in capillary and
venous whole blood samples. The HemoScreen system is a tabletop device and is comprised of
the following components: HemoScreen reader (analyzer plus software), cartridge with
preloaded reagents, blood collection sampler, on-board internal quality control, and external
liquid quality controls.
The cartridge module comprises reagent compartments, a microfluidic chip and a translucent
measurement portion. The reagents in the cartridge enable viscoelastic focusing, lysis of RBC,
and WBC staining. In addition to the cartridge, the system includes a disposable sampler, which
is used to collect the blood sample and then transfer it to the cartridge.
The HemoScreen provides the following blood count parameters: red blood cells (RBC), white
blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular
(erythrocyte) volume (MCV), mean cell (erythrocyte) hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell
(erythrocyte) hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW),
mean platelets volume (MPV), neutrophils (NEUT; #/%), monocytes (MONO; #/%),
lymphocytes (LYMP; #/%), eosinophils (EO; #/%) and basophiles (BASO; #/%). Of these, RBC,
WBC, PLT, MCH, MCV, RDW, MPV, NEUT%, MONO%, LYMP%, EO%, and BASO% are
quantitated by direct measurement, and HCT, HGB, MCHC, NEUT#, MONO#, LYMPH#, EO#,
and BASO# are calculated from the direct measurements.
B Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
HemoScreen Hematology Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
K240636 - Page 2 of 8

--- Page 3 ---
Specimen identification is performed by manual keyboard entry or use of a barcode reader.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
HemoScreen can be used with either capillary or venous anticoagulated whole blood,
collected in K2EDTA. Capillary blood sampling is performed by routine fingertip puncture
using a standard lancet. The blood is collected in an K2EDTA microtube (indirect sampling)
which is then taken into Sampler or directly from fingertip drawn into Sampler (direct
sampling). Venous blood, thoroughly mixed and at room temperature, can be used as well.
4. Calibration:
Factory calibration. The calibration of HemoScreen is traceable to the reference methods
described in CLSI H26-A2.
5. Quality Control:
The HemoScreen system includes both on-board internal and external quality controls.
Internal quality control includes built-in self-tests, whereby the software verifies performance
of the optics, reagent mixing, and instrument pneumatics. Every time the analyzer is turned
on, and before each measurement, it automatically verifies conformance to the measurement
specifications. Furthermore, internal self-testing occurs after the cartridge has been inserted,
thus validating the integrity of the disposable unit. The intensity and spectrum of all
illumination sources are tested using corresponding sensors, and the optical properties of
each cartridge are inspected automatically prior to each test.
Liquid Quality Controls (PIX-CBC): PIX-CBC Hematology Controls, 3-level commercial
liquid quality controls are used to cover all HemoScreen parameters. CBC-PIX is a reagent
composed of human erythrocytes and mammalian leukocytes and platelets suspended in a
plasma-like fluid with preservatives. PIX-CBC whole blood controls (Cat No. PIX002) are
produced by R&D Systems, a Bio-Techne brand, Minneapolis, MN.

correlation for all 20 parameters. For the regression analysis, the 95% confidence intervals

Limits of Detection, Blank, and Quantitation (LoD, LoB, and LoQ)
Five residual normal venous blood samples (from both morphological and cell distribution
aspects) were centrifuged to deplete the plasma supernatant of RBCs, WBCs and PLTs. Each of
the five plasma samples was assayed six times on two HemoScreen devices for a total of 60
measurements per parameter, using three cartridge and sampler lots. The limit of blank was
determined by the 95th percentile of the distribution of the study variable.
To determine the LoD and LoQ for WBC and PLT, five low level samples were derived from
native whole blood. Each of the five plasma samples was assayed six times on two HemoScreen
devices for a total of 60 measurements per parameter, using three cartridge and sampler lots. The
results for WBC and PLT were collected and used further for statistical analysis. The LoDs and
LoQs were calculated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A2 using the parametric option.
