B Indication(s) for Use:
RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel is intended to be used for the
quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from
the fingertips, forearm, or palm. It is intended to be used by a single person and should not be
shared.
RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel is intended for self- testing outside the
body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to monitor the
effectiveness of diabetes control. It should not be used for the diagnosis of, or screening for
diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be done only during steady-state
times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).
The RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel is comprised of the RIGHTEST
Meter Max Tel and the RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Test Strip Max.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
• OTC - Over The Counter
• For in vitro diagnostic use only
• For self-testing
• Single-patient use only
• Not for use on neonates
• RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel can only use with capillary whole
blood samples.
• DO NOT use the results from alternative sites (palm, forearm) for insulin dose calculations.
• DO NOT use the results from alternative site testing (palm, forearm) to calibrate Continuous
Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices.
• Not for use on critically ill patients, severely hypotensive individuals, patients in shock,
dehydrated patients, or in a hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state with or without ketosis.
• Do not use at altitudes greater than 10,000 feet (3,048 meters).
• Severe dehydration and excessive water loss may cause inaccurately low results.
• Not for screening or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.
• Use of this device on multiple patients may lead to transmission of Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or other
bloodborne pathogens.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Meter Max Tel
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel, is designed to quantitatively measure
the glucose concentration in fresh capillary whole blood from fingertip, palm or forearm.
RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel consists of: RIGHTEST Blood Glucose
Meter Max Tel, Blood Glucose Test Strip Max, RIGHTEST Control Solution GC700 (Level 1,
K240637 - Page 2 of 8

--- Page 3 ---
Level 2 and Level 4), RIGHTEST Lancing Device and Sterile Lancets (K221062). The
RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Test Strip Max is the same as Test Strip Max cleared in K173638.
The test strips, control solutions and lancing device can be purchased separately.
B Principle of Operation:
The RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel is designed to quantitatively
measure the glucose concentration in fresh capillary whole blood. The glucose measurement is
achieved by using the amperometric detection method that uses glucose dehydrogenase flavin-
adenine dinucleotide (GDH-FAD) based chemistry. When a drop of blood is applied to the test
strip it is pulled into the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with test
strip chemistry generating electrons and producing a current that is proportional to the glucose
concentration in the sample. After the reaction time, the detected current is calculated by the
meter and the resulting glucose concentration is displayed by the meter. The RIGHTEST Blood
Glucose Monitoring System Max Tel system reports glucose results as plasma glucose.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
RIGHTEST Blood Glucose Meter Max Tel
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Fresh capillary whole blood from user’s fingertips, palm, or forearm. Samples are to be
tested immediately upon collection. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test
strip by capillary action.
4. Calibration:
No user calibration is required. The meter is automatically coded.
5. Quality Control:
Three levels of control solution (Level 1, Level 2, Level 4) are for use to perform quality
control testing to check whether the system is working properly. Instructions on when to
perform a control test, details about the control solution, performing a control test,
understanding out-of-range control results are provided in the labeling. User needs to enter
the control solution mode (CS mode) on the meter to perform a quality control test. Control
solution ranges are printed on the test strip vial label.
This medical device product has functions subject to FDA premarket review as well as functions
that are not subject to FDA premarket review. For this application, if the product has functions

--- Page 4 ---
that are not subject to FDA premarket review, FDA assessed those functions only to the extent
that they either could adversely impact the safety and effectiveness of the functions subject to
FDA premarket review or they are included as a labeled positive impact that was considered in
the assessment of the functions subject to FDA premarket review.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Previously established in K231192.
2. Linearity:
The linearity study provided in K231192 supports the sponsor’s claimed glucose
measurement range of 20 - 600 mg/dL.
The meter displays “LO” with glucose values below 20 mg/dL and “HI” with glucose values
over 600 mg/dL. The LO and HI functions were validated and were demonstrated to function
as intended.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Previously established in K231192. The sponsor has included the following in the labeling:
The sponsor has the following statements in their labeling:
• If you have a condition, such as kidney disease or gout, that may cause your blood
levels of uric acid to rise to more than 12 mg/dL, the results from your meter may not
be correct.
• If you are taking a high level of vitamin C (ascorbic acid level in your blood > 3
mg/dL), your blood glucose results may not be reliable. If you are unsure, ask your
doctor.
• If you have a condition, such as jaundice, that may cause your blood levels of
Conjugated Bilirubin to rise to more than 30 mg/dL, the results from your meter may
not be correct.
• Do not test your blood glucose during or soon after a xylose absorption test. Xylose in
the blood can give inaccurate results with this meter.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Glucose 20 - 600 mg/dL.

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The system is traceable to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standard
reference material NIST SRM #917c. A method comparison was performed using the
candidate device and a YSI 2300 comparator method.
Test strip stability protocols and acceptance criteria were previously reviewed in K231192
and found acceptable to support the labeling claims that the test strips are stable for 4 months
after first being opened, and that closed vials are stable for 24 months when at the
recommended storage temperatures 39ºF - 86ºF (4ºC - 30ºC) and 10 - 90% relative humidity.
The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.

Accuracy at Extreme Glucose Values:
To supplement the previous accuracy performance studies conducted in K231192 and
support the broader measuring range claim (from previously cleared 50-550 mg/dL in
K231192 to 20-600 mg/dL) an additional extreme glucose study was performed using 113
capillary blood samples to assess the accuracy of the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring
System Max Tel at the extreme glucose concentrations at the extreme lower and upper ends
of the measuring range. Of the 113 samples, 72 were altered by glycolysis or spiking to
achieve appropriate glucose concentrations to achieve 53 samples ranging from 20.4 to 77.4
mg/dL glucose and 60 samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 257 to 599 mg/dL
(as measured by YSI 2300). Each sample was measured on the candidate device and results
compared to results obtained on the YSI 2300 analyzer. Results are summarized in the table
below:
For glucose concentrations < 80 mg/dL
Within ±5% Within ±10% Within ±15% Within ±20%
42/53 (79.2%) 50/53 (94.3%) 53/53 (100.0%) 53/53 (100.0%)
For glucose concentrations > 250 mg/dL
Within ±5% Within ±10% Within ±15% Within ±20%
51/60 (85.0%) 59/60 (98.3%) 60/60 (100.0%) 56/60 (100.0%)
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The sponsor includes the following in the labeling for the expected blood glucose values for
people without diabetes:
< 100 mg/dL fasting
<140 mg/dL 2 hours after a meal
