IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Sejoy Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the Sejoy Blood Glucose Meter and the
Sejoy Blood Glucose Test Strips and the Sejoy Advanced Link Blood Glucose Monitoring
System consists of the Sejoy Advanced Link Blood Glucose Meter and the Sejoy Blood Glucose
Test Strips. The test strips can be purchased in vials or individually wrapped foil packages.
The Sejoy Advanced Link Blood Glucose Meter uses Bluetooth to transmit glucose readings
wirelessly to mobile devices to the Glucojoy App. Both meters have an optional voice feature
that speaks certain messages such as the glucose results once testing is completed, announces
when the battery is low, speaks the error codes if an error were to occur etc.
The Sejoy Blood Glucose Control Solutions (CTRL1, CTRL2, CTRL3), Sejoy Lancing Device
(K222034) and Sejoy Disposable Safety Lancets (K222408) can be purchased separately for use
with both systems.
B Principle of Operation:
The Sejoy Blood Glucose Monitoring System and Sejoy Advance Link Blood Glucose
Monitoring Systems quantitatively measure the amount of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood
from the fingertip. Blood is applied to the end tip of the test strip and is then automatically pulled
into the reaction cell through capillary action. The reaction area of the test strip includes the
enzyme glucose dehydrogenase with cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD-GDH) and
mediator. Glucose in the sample reacts with the test strip chemistry to produce an electric current,
which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample. The meter measures the strength of
the current and displays the corresponding blood glucose concentration. The meter provides
plasma-equivalent results.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Sejoy Blood Glucose Meter
Sejoy Advance Link Blood Glucose Meter
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose system is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only.
The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
K240640 - Page 3 of 13

--- Page 4 ---
4. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The meter is automatically
coded.
5. Quality Control:
Three levels of glucose control solutions (CTRL1, CTRL2, CTRL3) are available with this
system and can be purchased separately. Recommendations on when to test the control
materials are provided in the labeling. Acceptable ranges for each level of control solution
are printed on the test strip vial label and test strip foil packet. If quality control test results
are out of range, the user is advised to repeat the test. If problems continue, the user is
cautioned not to use the meter and to contact the distributor. The Sejoy Blood Glucose Meter
and Sejoy Advance Link Blood Glucose Meter recognize the control solutions automatically
and do not store the control solution results.

Intermediate Precision (Between Run)
Intermediate (between run) precision was evaluated using 5 levels of glucose control
solutions (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250, 251 to 400 mg/dL) with 3 test strip lots
and 10 meters. Each control solution level was measured once a day for 10 days with each
meter and test strip lot, for a total of 100 replicates per control solution level per test strip lot
for a total of 300 replicates for each glucose control solution level. Results are summarized
below:

2. Linearity:
The linearity was evaluated using venous whole blood samples adjusted to 11 glucose levels
ranging from 17 to 619 mg/dL (17, 74, 139, 195, 253, 317, 382, 433, 492, 551 and 619
mg/dL as measured by comparator method YSI 2300 Analyzer) with 3 lots of test strips. Test
procedures were performed in 4 replicates per lot per concentration level. Glucose results
obtained using the Sejoy Advance Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System were compared to
those obtained using comparator method YSI 2300 analyzer. The results of the regression
analysis are: y = 1.0063x + 0.9607; R2 = 0.99667.
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20 to 600
mg/dL. If a sample result is less than 20 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as
“Lo”. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose, the result is flagged by the meter as
“Hi”. The “Lo” and “Hi” functions were validated by the sponsor and were demonstrated to
function as intended.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
To assess potential interference, studies were performed by spiking 33 exogenous and
endogenous substances into venous whole blood adjusted to three glucose levels (~60 mg/dL,
~125 mg/dL, and ~240 mg/dL). Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a
control pool, with the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances added to
the test pool. The relative bias (mg/dL) and % bias between the test sample and the control
sample was calculated using the mean of 10 replicates for each of 3 strip lots tested. The
highest tested concentration for each substance at which no significant interference was
observed (defined by the sponsor as less than ±10%) is summarized in the following table:

glucose reference material. The method comparison/lay-user study was performed using the
YSI 2300 STAT Plus Glucose Analyzer as the comparator method (see section VII.C.3).
Test Strip Stability
Test strip stability was assessed using real time stability and accelerated stability studies.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable to support the labeling
claims that the test strips are stable for 6 months after first being opened, and that closed vials
and individual foil wrapped test strips are stable for 24 months when stored at the
recommended storage temperatures 33.8ºF - 86ºF (1ºC - 30ºC) and 10 - 90% relative
humidity. The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.
6. Detection Limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL.

Method Comparison/Lay User Performance Study
To assess the performance of the Sejoy Blood Glucose Monitoring System and Sejoy
Advanced Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System in the hands of the intended lay users, the
sponsor conducted a study involving 352 lay user participants who collected and tested
samples from their own fingertip using only the instructions from the product labeling in
English. This study used the Sejoy Advanced Link Blood Glucose Monitoring System as the
more complicated of the two candidate systems and 3 test strip lots. Results were analyzed
by comparing blood glucose results obtained by the lay users with the Sejoy Advanced Link
System against results obtained using a laboratory comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer).
Glucose concentrations in the samples ranged from approximately 64.2 to 491.5 mg/dL as
measured by the comparator method, which included 45 unaltered samples below 80 mg/dL
and 51 samples above 250 mg/dL. Results are summarized in the tables below:

Usability
At the end of the lay-user study, each participant was asked to complete a usability
questionnaire regarding ease of understanding of information in the user manual and the ease
of use when performing a blood glucose test. The sponsor’s analysis of the questionnaire
responses demonstrated that the participants were satisfied with the ease of operation by
following the instructions for use in the user’s manual and with the overall performance of
the Sejoy Advanced Link Blood Glucose Monitoring system.
Labeling Readability
A Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted on the user’s manual, test strip
insert, and quick reference guide that demonstrated a readability level at an 8th grade level or
lower.
Extreme Glucose Study
An accuracy study was performed to evaluate the performance of the Sejoy Advanced Link
Blood Glucose Monitoring System with 100 capillary blood samples containing extreme
glucose concentrations at the extreme lower and upper ends of the claimed glucose
measuring range. Glucose concentrations below 80 mg/dL were achieved with 50 samples
altered by glycolysis and glucose concentrations greater than 250 mg/dL were achieved with
50 samples spiked with glucose. Results on the candidate device using 3 test strip lots were
compared to the results obtained using the comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer) and are
summarized below:
Glucose
Within ± 5% Within ± 10% Within ± 15% Within ± 20%
Range
Extreme Low 27/50 46/50 50/50 50/50
(<80 mg/dL) (54.0%) (92.0%) (100%) (100%)
Extreme High 30/50 48/50 50/50 50/50
(>250 mg/dL) (60.0%) (96.0%) (100%) (100%)

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit Study
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood samples
with hematocrit levels of 15 to 60% (15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 42%, 45%, 50%, 55%, and
60%) at 5 levels of glucose (30 – 50, 51 – 110, 111 – 150, 151 – 250, and 251 – 400 mg/dL).
Each sample was tested in replicates of 10 using 3 test strip lots. The results obtained with
the candidate system were compared to those obtained with the comparator method (YSI
2300 analyzer). The results demonstrated acceptable performance of the candidate blood
glucose monitoring systems across the claimed hematocrit range of 15 to 60%.
2. System Operating Conditions Study
To evaluate device performance over varying operating temperature and humidity conditions,
venous whole blood samples were adjusted to 5 glucose levels (20-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-
250, and 251-600 mg/dL). There were four extreme temperature and humidity combinations
tested (high temperature/low humidity 45℃/10%, low temperature/high humidity 5℃/90%,
high temperature/high humidity 45℃/90%, and low temperature/low humidity 5℃/10%).
The results obtained with the candidate system were compared to those obtained with the
comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results support the claims in the labeling that
the candidate blood glucose monitoring systems can be used in conditions of 41 to 113°F (5
to 45°C) with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
3. Altitude Effects Study
To evaluate the effects of altitude, a study was conducted using fingerstick whole blood
samples altered to achieve 5 glucose concentrations ranging from 40.0 to 319.2 mg/dL. Each
sample was tested using 3 test strip lots and 2 glucose in a pressurized chamber with
corresponding pressure and oxygen content at 8 simulated altitudes from 0 to 11,482.9 ft.
The results of obtained with the candidate system were compared to those obtained with the
comparator method (YSI 2300 analyzer). The results support the claims that the candidate
blood glucose monitoring systems function as intended at altitudes up to the claimed altitude
of 10,000 feet.
4. Sample Volume Study
Venous blood samples were prepared at 3 glucose range intervals (0-65 mg/dL, 100-120
mg/dL, and 200-250 mg/dL) and were tested at different sample volumes starting at 1.0 μL
and incrementally decreased by 0.1 μL until an error code appeared. The results of obtained
with the candidate system were compared to those obtained with the comparator method
(YSI 2300 analyzer). The sponsor provided validation studies demonstrating that with blood
volumes below 0.6 μL, the insufficient sample volume error message functioned as intended.
The results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.6 μL for the candidate blood
glucose monitoring systems.
5. Flex Studies
The following additional flex studies were performed with the candidate system: drop/shock,
early test strip removal, intermittent sampling, sample outside measuring range, sample
perturbation, shipping, used test strips and vibration testing. The results demonstrated that the
performance of the candidate blood glucose monitoring systems are robust under these
conditions.

6. Electrical Safety and Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Testing
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electrical safety and (EMC)
testing had been performed. The Sejoy blood glucose monitoring system was found to be
compliant.
7. Infection Control Testing
The device systems are intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies
were performed on the external meter materials by an outside commercial testing laboratory
demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant,
CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA Registration # 46781-17). A robustness study was
also conducted by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance nor in
the external materials of the meter after 4000 cleaning and disinfection cycles using the
CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 3
years of single-patient device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8. Glucose Test Strip Lot Release Protocol
The test strip lot release protocol and criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
