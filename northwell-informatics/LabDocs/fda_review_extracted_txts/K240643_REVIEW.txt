B Indication(s) for Use:
MissLan® Early Detection Pregnancy Test Strip is used for qualitative detection of Human
Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) in human urine. This test is intended for use as an aid in early
detection of pregnancy, in some cases as early as six (6) days before the day of the missed
period, (i.e. as early as five (5) days before the day of the expected period). It is intended for use
by people who would like to find out whether they are pregnant in a home environment. Only for
use outside the body. For over-the-counter use.
Important note regarding positive results:
Because this test detects low levels of hCG, it is possible that this test may give positive results
even if you are not pregnant. All results should be confirmed by your healthcare provider,

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The test comes in three formats (strip, cassette, and midstream) named MissLan® Early
Detection Pregnancy Test Strip, MissLan® Early Detection Pregnancy Test Cassette, and
MissLan® Early Detection Pregnancy Test Midstream, respectively. The strip format is a single
test strip. The cassette format consists of a single test strip assembled in a plastic housing. A
urine collection cup and a dropper are included in the packaging. The strip and cassette formats
are designed to be used in dip sampling mode only. The midstream format consists of a single
test strip assembled in a plastic housing with an absorbent tip and is designed to be tested in dip
or in-stream sampling modes. Each device type is packaged sealed with a desiccant and
instructions for use. The result is displayed within the test window by two distinct colored lines,
one control line (C) and one test line (T).
B Principle of Operation:
The MissLan® Early Detection Pregnancy Test Strip, MissLan® Early Detection Pregnancy Test
Cassette, and MissLan® Early Detection Pregnancy Test Midstream are lateral flow
immunoassays for in vitro qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in
human urine. The devices utilize a combination of antibodies to detect hCG in urine as well as to
serve as a run control. Each device contains mouse monoclonal anti-β-hCG antibody colloidal
gold conjugate pre-dried on the sample pad. Mouse monoclonal anti-α-hCG antibody (on the test
line) and goat anti mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (on the control line) are coated and
immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane. The test result is shown in the test window and is
read visually between 3 and 10 minutes of urine application. If hCG is present in the sample, a
colored line will appear in the test zone (T) indicating a positive test result (pregnant). If there is
no hCG or levels are below the claimed cut-off in the urine, a colored line in the test zone (T)
will be absent, indicating a negative test result (not pregnant). The control line (C line) should
develop in the control zone regardless of the test result on both tests. If the control line (C line)
does not appear (no color appears at the control line after application of the sample), the test is
invalid.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed on the MissLan® Early Detection Pregnancy Test Strip,
MissLan® Early Detection Pregnancy Test Cassette, and the MissLan® Early Detection
Pregnancy Test Midstream. For the MissLan® Early Detection Pregnancy Test Midstream
format, both in-stream and dip sampling modes were tested. The samples were prepared by
spiking negative female urine with hCG traceable to the 5th WHO international standard to
obtain samples with hCG contractions of 0, 3, 3.5, 5, 6.5, 7.5, 10, 15 and 25 mIU/mL.
Samples were tested in replicates of ten per day for five days for each device lot by three
operators. A total of three device lots for each format were tested and each operator tested
one lot separately. The results are summarized in the table below.

Because the device detects low levels of hCG that could be found in some non-pregnant
women, the sponsor included a limitation in the labeling (see Section III.C. above).
2. Linearity:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference from exogenous and endogenous substances:
To evaluate potential interference from certain exogenous and endogenous substances,
negative urine samples from non-pregnant healthy females were used to prepare samples
with hCG concentrations of 0 mIU/mL, 3 mIU/mL, and 10 mIU/mL, which were then spiked
with potentially interfering substances at the concentrations listed below. Samples were
tested by three operators, in triplicate, using three device lots. No interference was observed
at the concentrations shown in the table below:

Cross-reactivity of Structurally Related Compounds:
To evaluate cross-reactivity, negative urine samples (0 mIU/mL) and negative urine samples
spiked with hCG levels of 3 mIU/mL and 10 mIU/mL were spiked with the following
potential cross reactants: 500 mIU/mL luteinizing hormone (hLH), 1000 mIU/mL follicle-
stimulating hormone (hFSH), and 1 mIU/mL thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH). The
samples were tested in replicates of ten using three device lots by three different operators.
The results demonstrated that no cross-reactivity from potential cross- reactants was
observed at the tested concentrations.

Effects of Urine pH:
A study was performed to evaluate the effects of pH on device performance. Negative female
urine samples (0 mIU/mL) and negative samples spiked with hCG to levels of 3 mIU/mL and
10 mIU/mL were adjusted to have pH values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0. The negative
and positive hCG samples with the different pH levels were tested in triplicate using three
lots of the device by three operators. The results demonstrated that changes in pH ranging
from 4.0 to 9.0 do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the device.
Effects of Urine Specific Gravity:
A study was performed to evaluate the effects of urine specific gravity on device
performance. Negative female urine samples (0 mIU/mL) and negative samples spiked with
hCG to levels of 3 mIU/mL and 10 mIU/mL hCG were adjusted to specific gravities of
1.000, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030 and 1.035. The negative and positive hCG
samples with the different specific gravity levels were tested in triplicate using three device
lots by three operators. The results demonstrated that changes in specific gravity ranging
from 1.000 to 1.035 do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the device.
Hook Effect:
Negative female urine samples were spiked with hCG at concentrations of 6,250, 12,500,
25,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, and 500,000 mIU/mL. The samples were tested in
replicates of five using three device lots by three operators. The results demonstrated that no
hook effect was observed at hCG concentration up to 500,000 mIU/mL.
Effects of hCG β-core fragment:
Interference testing was performed to evaluate whether high levels of β-core (hCGβcf)
fragment interfere with device performance. Four different female urine sample pools (spiked
to contain 0, 3, 10, and 20,000 mIU/mL hCG) were spiked with hCGβcf at concentrations of
50,000 pmol/L, 125,000 pmol/L, 250,000 pmol/L, and 500,000 pmol/L. The samples were
tested in replicates of ten using three lots of the device by three operators. The results
demonstrated that the device is not affected by hCGβcf concentrations up to 500,000 pmol/L.

Detection of hCG in Early Pregnancy Clinical Samples:
A total of 650 urine samples were collected from 65 women between the ages of 18 to 45
who planned to become pregnant and were later confirmed via ultrasound to be pregnant.
The testing was conducted starting from 8 days before the expected menstrual period to the
first day after the expected menstrual period (EMP+1). Each sample was tested using the
MissLan® Early Detection Pregnancy Test Strip, MissLan® Early Detection Pregnancy Test
Cassette, and the MissLan® Early Detection Pregnancy Test Midstream. For the MissLan®
Early Detection Pregnancy Test Midstream format, both in-stream and dip sampling modes
were tested. The same results were observed for all three device formats and both sampling
modes of the Midstream format. The following is a representative summary for the result for
all conditions tested which supports the claim of detecting pregnancy as early as six (6) days
before the day of the missed period, (i.e., as early as five (5) days before the day of the
expected period).
