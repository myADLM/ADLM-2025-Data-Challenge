Dochek® Multi-Drug Urine Test Dipcard Rx offers any combinations from 1 to 16 drugs but
only one cutoff concentration under same drug condition will be included per device. It is
intended for prescription use. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The test provides only preliminary results. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary
positive result. To obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical
method is needed. GC/MS or LC/MS is the recommended confirmatory method.

Dochek® Multi-Drug Urine Test Dipcard offers any combinations from 1 to 16 drugs but only
one cutoff concentration under same drug condition will be included per device. It is intended for
over-the-counter (OTC) use. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The test provides only preliminary results. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary
positive result. To obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical
method is needed. GC/MS or LC/MS is the recommended confirmatory method.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Dochek® Multi-Drug Urine Test Dipcard Rx and Dochek® Multi-Drug Urine Test Dipcard are
immunochromatographic assays that use a lateral flow system for the qualitative detection of
single or multiple drugs in human urine.
This device is a dipcard format in which the test strips are integrated into the plastic dipcard.
After removing the cap of the dipcard, the absorbent end of the test strips is exposed and can be
in direct contact with the urine sample. The device is in a ready-to-use format and no longer
requires assembly before use. The products are single-use in vitro diagnostic devices.
B Principle of Operation:
The candidate device is a competitive immunoassay that is used to screen for the presence of
various drugs and drug metabolites in urine. It is a chromatographic absorbent device in which,
drugs within a urine sample, competitively combined to a limited number of drug monoclonal
antibody (mouse) conjugate binding sites. When the test is activated, the urine is absorbed into
each test strip by capillary action, mixes with the respective drug monoclonal antibody
conjugate, and flows across a pre-coated membrane. When drug within the urine sample is below
the detection level of the test, respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate binds to the
respective drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the test strip. This
produces a colored Test line in the Test Region (T) of the strip, which, regardless of its intensity,
indicates a negative test result.
K240698 - Page 5 of 45

--- Page 6 ---
When sample drug levels are at or above the detection level of the test, the free drug in the
sample binds to the respective drug monoclonal antibody conjugate, preventing the respective
drug monoclonal antibody conjugate from binding to the respective drug-protein conjugate
immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This prevents the development of a distinct
colored band in the test region, indicating a preliminary positive result. To serve as a procedure
control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C) of each strip, if the test has been
performed properly.

Precision studies were performed in-house for samples with concentrations of +100% cutoff,
+75% cutoff, +50% cutoff, +25% cutoff, cutoff, -25% cutoff, -50% cutoff, -75% cut off and -
100% cutoff. Samples were prepared by spiking target drug into drug-free urine samples.
Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Two configurations of samples were
tested, as listed below. For each configuration, testing was performed over two runs per day
for 25 days using three lots with one operator per lot.

To test cross-reactivity, drug metabolites and other structurally related compounds that are
likely to cross-react were spiked into negative urine and were tested using three lots of each
device. The lowest concentration that caused a positive result for each compound is listed
below along with the corresponding % cross-reactivity. If no cross-reactivity was observed,
the highest concentration tested is listed below along with the cross-reactivity as a “<”
concentration.

Effect of Urinary Specific Gravity and pH:
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples with specific
gravity at 1.000, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030, and 1.035 and urine samples with pH
at 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 were spiked with the target drugs to concentrations at 25% below and 25%
above the cutoff level for each drug. These samples were tested using three lots with two
configurations. The results demonstrated that pH levels of 4 to 9 and specific gravity levels of
1.000 to 1.035 do not affect the results of the assays.

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies were performed in-house by three operators. Eighty (80)
unaltered clinical samples were run for each target drug. The samples were tested in a
blinded fashion and compared to LC/MS results. The results are presented in the tables

2. Lay user study:
A lay user study was performed using configuration 1 and configuration 2 at three intended use
sites with the results read by 280 lay persons. The lay users had diverse ages and educational and
professional backgrounds. Urine samples were prepared at multiple concentrations (Negative (-
100%), +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff) by spiking drugs into drug free pooled urine
specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was
aliquoted into individual containers and tested in a blinded fashion. Each participant was
provided with the package insert, one blind-labeled sample and a dipcard device, and with no
assistance. Summary results are shown below:
