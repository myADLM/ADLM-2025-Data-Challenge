III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The IDS-iSYS Free Testosterone assay is an in vitro diagnostic device intended for the
quantitative determination of free testosterone in human serum or plasma on the IDS system.
Measurement of free testosterone is used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving
the male sex hormones (androgens), including primary and secondary hypogonadism, impotence
in male and in females; hirsutism (excessive hair) and virilization (masculinization) due to
tumors, polycystic ovaries and androgenital syndromes.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
IDS-iSYS Multi-Discipline Automated Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The IDS-iSYS Free Testosterone assay consists of a reagent cartridge. The reagent cartridge
contains:
• Magnetic particles coated with Streptavidin in a buffer containing preservative, one bottle,
2.5 mL.
• Monoclonal anti-testosterone labelled with biotin, in a buffer containing preservative, one
bottle, 7.5 mL
• Testosterone labelled with an acridinium ester derivative, in a buffer containing protein
and preservative, one bottle, 3.5 mL
B Principle of Operation:
The IDS-iSYS Free Testosterone test system uses a competitive enzyme immunoassay
technology. 20 μL of patient sample or calibrators are incubated with the biotinylated
monoclonal anti- testosterone antibody, an acridinium labeled testosterone conjugate and
streptavidin labeled magnetic particles. The magnetic particles are captured using a magnet and a
wash step is performed to remove any unbound analyte. Trigger reagents are added; the resulting
light emitted by the acridinium label is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the
original sample.

2. Linearity:
A study was performed based on the CLSI Guideline EP06-Ed2. Three dilution series spanning
the analytical measuring interval were prepared by mixing high and low serum samples pools.
All dilution levels were assayed in replicates of four. Linearity was evaluated using linear
regression analysis. The deviation from linearity did not exceed -6.6% for samples with free
testosterone concentrations from the LoQ to 68.21 pg/mL.
The combined linear regression for all 3 dilution series was as follows:
Y= 1.00x-0.04; R = 1.00
The results from the linearity study support an analytical measuring interval of 0.40 - 60 pg/mL.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference and cross-reactivity studies were conducted following the CLSI EP7-Ed3
guideline.
Interference:
Aliquots from pools of human serum with free testosterone concentrations of 1.0 pg/mL or
45 pg/mL were spiked with potentially interfering substances. The samples were assayed,
and the free testosterone concentrations of the spiked samples were compared to control
samples without interferent. No significant interference (≤±10% bias) was observed when the
interfering substances were tested at the following concentrations:
Highest concentration at which no
Substance
significant interference was observed
Acetylsalicylic Acid 1.67 mmol/L
Acetaminophen 1030 μmol/L
Bilirubin (Conjugated) 40 mg/dL
Bilirubin (Unconjugated) 40 mg/dL
Human Anti Mouse Antibody (HAMA) 1000 ng/dL
Hemoglobin 300 mg/dL
Ibuprofen 1060 μmol/L
Total Protein 10 g/dL
Salicylic Acid 2.07 mmol/L
Triglycerides 1500 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor (RhF) 1500 IU/mL
To evaluate the candidate device’s susceptibility to biotin interference, biotin was spiked into
serum samples containing different concentrations of free testosterone (approximately 1.5
pg/mL, 20 pg/mL, or 45 pg/mL). Samples were assayed in multiple replicates. The sponsor
defined no significant interference as ≤10% bias. The results are summarized below.
% Bias for Samples Containing Various Concentration of Biotin
Testosterone Biotin Concentration (ng/mL)
Concentration 250 500 750 870 1750
1.5 pg/mL 5.4% -10% 11% -6% 61%
20 pg/mL 6.0% -9% 8% NT NT
45 pg/mL 9.0% -10% 16% 33% 64%
NT = Not Tested
The sponsor has included the following limitations in the labeling:
- Specimens that contain biotin at a concentration of 500 ng/mL demonstrate a less than or
equal to ±10% change in results. Biotin concentrations greater than this may lead to falsely
elevated results for patient samples. The recommended adult daily dietary intake for biotin
is 30 μg/day. Over the counter dietary supplements promoted for use in hair, skin and nail
health may contain 5-10 mg of biotin. Pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults have

Specimens that contain biotin at a concentration of 500 ng/mL demonstrate a less than or
equal to ±10% change in results. Biotin concentrations greater than this may lead to falsely
elevated results for patient samples. The recommended adult daily dietary intake for biotin
is 30 μg/day. Over the counter dietary supplements promoted for use in hair, skin and nail
health may contain 5-10 mg of biotin. Pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults have

--- Page 7 ---
shown that ingesting 5 mg of biotin can result in serum levels as high as 73 ng/mL. In rare
cases, subjects are prescribed up to 300 mg of biotin per day for therapeutic applications,
resulting in serum biotin levels as high as 1,160 ng/mL.
- The lowest Total Protein level that does not significantly interfere (≤±10% bias) with IDS
Free Testosterone assay is 10 g/dL.
- The lowest Hemoglobin level that does not significantly interfere (≤±10% bias) with the
assay is 300 mg/dL. Visual hemolysis in the sample is typically already seen in samples
with hemoglobin concentration of 50 mg/dL or greater. Visibly hemolyzed samples must
not be used with IDS Free Testosterone assay.
- Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins,
interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to animal
serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may be observed.
Cross-Reactivity:
A cross-reactivity study was performed to evaluate the following substances. Aliquots from
pools of human serum with a free testosterone concentration of 1.0 pg/mL or 15 pg/mL were
spiked with potentially cross-reactive substances. The samples were assayed and the resulting
percent cross-reactivity was calculated using the following formula:
% Cross Reactivity = 100 x (Average “spike” concentration – Average “blank
concentration) / Spike concentration

5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The IDS-iSYS Free Testosterone assay is traceable to an internal reference material which is
traceable to another commercially available assay.
6. Detection Limit
Determination of the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) were conducted in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
Limit of Blank (LoB)
For determination of LoB, four analyte-free samples were measured in replicates of 5 using 3
reagent lots over 5 days for a total of 60 replicates per reagent lot on one IDS-iSYS Multi-
Discipline Automated Analyzer. LoB was calculated according to the parametric function as
described in CLSI EP17-A2.
Limit of Detection (LoD)
For determination of LoD, seven serum samples with low-analyte concentrations were
measured in replicates of 5 across 3 reagent lots over 3 days for a total of 105 replicates per
reagent lot on one IDS-iSYS Multi-Discipline Automated Analyzer. LoD was calculated
according to CLSI EP17-A2.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
For the determination of LoQ, seven serum samples were measured in replicates of 5 across 3
reagent lots over 3 days for a total of 105 replicates per reagent lot on one IDS-iSYS Multi-
Discipline Automated Analyzer. The LoQ was defined as the concentration of analyte which
has imprecision less than 20% CV.
The summary results for LoB, LoD and LoQ are shown below.

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix comparison study was conducted using 40 matched serum (without additives),
serum gel separator tubes (SST) and plasma (K EDTA, Lithium Heparin, and Sodium
2
Heparin) samples with concentrations ranging from 0.40 to 58.45 pg/mL. The samples were
tested in duplicate using one reagent lot, but only the first replicate was used for data
analysis. The Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed. The summary results are
shown below.
Tube type N Slope Intercept Correlation coefficient r
SST 40 0.96 0.08 1.00
K EDTA 40 0.97 0.08 0.99
2
Li Heparin 40 0.97 0.03 0.99
Na Heparin 40 0.97 0.00 0.99
The results demonstrate equivalency between serum, serum gel separator tubes (SST) and
plasma (K EDTA, Lithium Heparin, and Sodium Heparin) sample matrices.

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A reference interval study was performed for the IDS Free Testosterone assay in accordance with
CLSI EP28-A3c guideline. A total of 563 adult serum samples were collected from apparently
healthy individuals. The sample groups tested consisted of:
• 309 adult males between 21 and 77 years of age
• 254 adult females between 21 and 77 years of age
The data were analyzed to generate a nonparametric 95% reference interval using the 2.5th and
97.5th percentiles as reference limits. The resulting reference interval is summarized in the
following table:
Males 21 to 39 years 40 to 59 years ≥ 60 years
N of subjects 129 138 42
Median (pg/mL) 12.36 8.70 7.78
Observed Range (pg/mL) 4.91 to 21.64 3.73 to 14.96 2.25 to 11.37
(2.5th to 97.5th percentile)
Females 21 to 39 years 40 to 59 years ≥ 60 years
N of subjects 130 57 67
Median (pg/mL) 1.13 0.71 0.89
Observed Range (pg/mL) 0.46 to 2.20 0.40 to 1.74 0.42 to 2.20
(2.5th to 97.5th percentile)
Other Supportive Information
The sponsor evaluated whether the conjugate binds to SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin).
Charcoal-stripped human serum was spiked with SHBG at concentrations ranging from 6.25 to
200 µg/mL and then assayed. All concentrations tested exhibited less than or equal to 7%
binding.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
