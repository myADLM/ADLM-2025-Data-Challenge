III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative for use on the cobas 5800/6800/8800 Systems is a real-time RT-
PCR test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acids from SARS-CoV-2 in
nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of COVID-
19 and in anterior nasal swab specimens collected from any individuals with or without signs and
symptoms of COVID-19.
Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Positive results do not rule
out bacterial infection or co-infection with other pathogens.
Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis
for patient management decisions. Results are meant to be used in conjunction with clinical
observations, patient history, recent exposures, epidemiological information, and laboratory data,
in accordance with the guidelines provided by the relevant public health authorities.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IVD - For in vitro diagnostic use
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use with the cobas 5800/6800/8800 Systems.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative for use on the cobas 5800/6800/8800 Systems is a fully
automated test system including sample preparation (nucleic acid extraction and purification)
followed by PCR amplification and detection. The cobas 5800/6800/8800 Systems consists of
three separate instruments, the cobas 5800 System, the cobas 6800 System and the cobas 8800
System, which allow users to perform multiple PCR-based in vitro nucleic acid amplification
tests. The cobas 5800/6800/8800 Systems consist of the sample supply module, the transfer
module, the processing module, and the analytic module. Automated data management is
performed by the cobas 5800/6800/8800 Systems software(s), which assigns test results for all
tests. Results can be reviewed directly on the system screen and printed as a report.
Nucleic acid from patient samples and added internal control RNA (RNA IC) molecules are
simultaneously extracted. Nucleic acid is released by addition of proteinase and lysis reagent to
the sample. The released nucleic acid binds to the silica surface of the added magnetic glass
particles. Unbound substances and impurities, such as denatured protein, cellular debris, and
potential PCR inhibitors, are removed with subsequent wash steps and purified nucleic acid is
K240867 - Page 2 of 7

--- Page 3 ---
eluted from the magnetic glass particles with elution buffer at elevated temperature. External
controls (positive and negative) are processed in the same way.
Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the sample is achieved using target specific
forward and reverse primers for ORF1 a/b non-structural region that is unique to SARS- CoV-2.
Additionally, a conserved region in the structural protein envelope E-gene were chosen for pan-
Sarbecovirus detection. The pan-Sarbecovirus detection sets will also detect SARS-CoV- 2 virus.
Selective amplification of RNA IC is achieved using non-competitive sequence specific forward
and reverse primers which have no homology with the coronavirus genome. A thermostable
DNA polymerase enzyme is used for amplification. For more details, refer to K213804 and
K231306.

An updated in-silico analysis was performed in January 2025 using all SARS-CoV-2 sequences
submitted to the GISAID database till date (as of January 15, 2025) and are reported in Table 1
below. The in-silico analysis results indicate that >99.9% of sequences for SARS-CoV-2 have no
changes in primer/probe binding sites at both target regions simultaneously. All sequences are
predicted to be detected by at least one of the two target regions.

Real-World evidence (NFL surveillance program)
The clinical performance of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative with asymptomatic subjects was
assessed using real-world data collected from the 2020 National Football League (NFL) COVID-
19 Surveillance Program where samples were collected and tested between August 2020-January
2021 as part of an Occupational Testing protocol. Anterior nasal swab samples were
prospectively collected on a near-daily basis from NFL players and staff.
The performance of cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative were estimated using comparator algorithm
that was based on molecular comparator test results and/or clinical adjudication performed
within the NFL testing program. A total of 1776 samples were selected for analysis where the
cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative candidate test, and comparator test results, were evaluable to
establish the COVID-19 status for each sample. The results are shown below.

asymptomatic individuals (NFL).

Note: CI = confidence interval, PPA = positive percent agreement, NPA = negative percent agreement
Clinical Study
The clinical performance of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative with asymptomatic subjects was
also assessed using data collected from the 2021 Test Us at Home (TUAH) study where samples
were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 between October 2021 and April 2022 as part of a
longitudinal study. Anterior nasal swab samples were prospectively collected every 48 hours
from each participant over 15 days.
The performance of cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative was estimated using a comparator algorithm
where two consecutive test results (molecular test) over 48 hours were used to determine
comparator result. All samples (38,185) from the TUAH study that had a valid comparator
algorithm and a valid candidate test result were included in the calculation of performance
estimates of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative. The results are shown in table below.
