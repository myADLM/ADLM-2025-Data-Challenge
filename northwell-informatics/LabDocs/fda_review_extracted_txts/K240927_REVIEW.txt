III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
Access Thyroglobulin assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of thyroglobulin levels in human serum and plasma using the Access
Immunoassay Systems. This device is intended to aid in monitoring for the presence of persistent
or recurrent/metastatic disease in patients who have differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and
have had thyroid surgery (with or without ablative therapy), and who lack serum thyroglobulin
antibodies.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as Indended Use
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
The Instruction for Use of the device contains the following warnings:
The presence of serum autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (TgAb) can interfere with assays for
thyroglobulin (Tg). Therefore, sera which contain TgAb, even at very low levels, should not be
tested for Tg.
The concentration of thyroglobulin in a given specimen determined with assays from different
manufacturers can vary due to differences in assay methods and reagent specificity. The results
reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the Tg assay used. Values
obtained with different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably. If, in the course of
monitoring a patient, the assay method used for determining Tg levels serially is changed,
additional sequential testing should be carried out to confirm baseline values.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (K221225)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Each Access Thyroglobulin reagent kit contains two reagent packs (50 tests/pack). Each pack
contains the following:
• R1a (3.25 mL): Dynabeads paramagnetic particles coated with streptavidin and coupled
to biotinylated mouse monoclonal antithyroglobulin antibodies in TRIS
buffer with protein (bovine) and preservatives
K240927 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
• R1b (3.10 mL): Mouse monoclonal anti-thyroglobulin-alkaline phosphatase (bovine)
conjugate in a TRIS buffer with protein (bovine, murine) and
preservatives
• R1c (3.10 mL): HEPES buffer with protein (bovine, murine) and preservatives
Materials needed but not supplied:
• Access Thyroglobulin Calibrators: Six levels (0, 1.0, 10, 100, 250, and 500 ng/mL)
• Quality Control Materials: commercial control material
• Substrate: Lumi-Phos PRO
• Unicel DxI Wash Buffer II
• Access Thyroglobulin Sample Diluent (optional)
The modification of the Access Thyroglobulin is to replace substrate (Lumi-Phos 530) of the
Access Thyroglobulin with a new substrate (Lumi-Phos PRO) on the DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access Thyroglobulin assay is a simultaneous one-step immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”)
assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel with four biotinylated anti-thyroglobulin antibodies
coated on streptavidin paramagnetic particles, and monoclonal anti-thyroglobulin antibody
alkaline phosphatase conjugate. The thyroglobulin in the sample binds to the biotinylated
antibodies on the solid phase, while the conjugate antibody reacts with a different antigenic site
on the thyroglobulin molecule. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid
phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured
with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of
thyroglobulin in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored,
multi-point calibration curve.

b) Lot-to-Lot Precision
The lot-to-lot precision of Lumi-Phos PRO Substrate was assessed in K223921.
The lot-to-lot precision of the modified Access Thyroglobulin reagent was evaluated
using three reagent lots on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. Serum samples
at different concentrations were tested in five replicates per run, one run per day over five
days, resulting N=75 datapoints per sample on one instrument. The same study was also
performed on two additional instruments. The data were analyzed for within-run,
between-day, and between-lot, and total precision. Across three instruments, the CV% for
reagent lot-to-lot imprecision is ≤ 6.6% for all samples tested.
c) Instrument-to-Instrument Precision:
The study was performed by testing six serum samples at different concentrations on
three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers. Each sample was tested in five
replicates per run, one run per day over five days, resulting in minimum N=75 datapoints
using one lot of reagents. The same study was also performed on two additional reagent
lots. The representative data of instrument-to-instrument reproducibility are summarized
in the table below on one representative reagent lot are summarized in the table below.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
The assay reportable range for the Access Thyroglobulin is the same as the claimed AMI:
0.1–500 ng/mL.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability:
The traceability was established in K002905. There is no change to the traceability of the
modified Access Thyroglobulin.
b) Stability:
The Access Thyroglobulin Reagent kit and the Lumi-Phos PRO substrate are packaged
separately. Access Thyroglobulin Reagent kit stability was established in K220972. The
proposed change is to replace the substrate (Lumi-Phos 530) with a new substrate (Lumi-
Phos PRO) for the assay run on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. The shelf-life

claims and on-board stability claims of Lumi-Phos PRO substrate were established in
K221225.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the
modified Access Thyroglobulin on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer were
determined based on the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
a) LoB:
The LoB was determined by testing five thyroglobulin-depleted individual native serum
samples using two modified Access Thyroglobulin reagent lots on two DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzers. Samples were run in five replicates per run, one run per day, for
three days on one DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer, resulting in 75 replicates for
each reagent lot on each instrument. LoB was defined as the value corresponding to the
95th percentile of the rank position of the distribution of values. This resulted in the LoB
value of 0.01 ng/mL for each of two reagent lots. The claimed LoB for the modified
Access Thyroglobulin on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.03 ng/mL.
b) LoD:
The LoD was determined by testing six native serum specimens comprised of an
individual native serum sample and five pools of native serum samples using two
modified Access Thyroglobulin reagent lots on two DxI Access 9000 Immunoassay
Analyzers. Samples were run a minimum of eight replicates per run, one run per day, for
five days for each reagent lot on each DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. The LoD
was calculated for each reagent lot based on LoB + “SD multiplied by the 95th percentile
of the standard normal distribution” per CLSI EP17-A2. The claimed LoD for the
modified Access Thyroglobulin assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is
0.05 ng/mL.
c) LoQ:
The LoQ was determined by testing 10 native serum specimens comprised of two
individual native serum samples and eight pools of native serum samples using two
modified Access Thyroglobulin reagent lots on two DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
Analyzers. Samples were run a minimum of nine replicates per run, one run per day, for
five days for each reagent lot on each DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. The
estimated LoQ of the modified Access Thyroglobulin was set to be the Thyroglobulin
concentration which met the within-laboratory imprecision of 20%CV. The claimed LoQ
for the modified Access Thyroglobulin assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
Analyzer is 0.1 ng/mL.

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
CLSI guideline EP09c, 3rd Edition was followed to compare the modified Access
Thyroglobulin assay on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer to the predicate device,
the Access Thyroglobulin assay on the Access 2 Immunoassay Analyzer. Samples falling
within the analytical measuring interval of both assays were evaluated. A total of 187 serum
samples (185 were native individual serum samples, two samples were native serum samples
supplemented with purified human Thyroglobulin antigen) were tested with four modified
Access Thyroglobulin reagent pack lots on four DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers
(candidate), and four Access Thyroglobulin reagent pack lots on four Access 2 Immunoassay
Analyzers (predicate). The comparison between paired measurements was analyzed using
Passing-Bablok method by fitting the observed modified Access Thyroglobulin on the DxI
9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (y) into a linear regression model, with the observed
value from the predicate (x). The results are summarized in the following table:
