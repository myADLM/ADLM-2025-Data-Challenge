designed to run only i-STAT test cartridges. The analyzer is the main user interface of the i-
STAT System and functions as the electro-mechanical interface to the test cartridge. All fluid
movements within the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge (test sample or reagent) are automatically
controlled by the i-STAT 1 analyzer by electro-mechanical interaction with the cartridge. No
additional reagents or steps are required to run the cartridge. The infrared receiver component in
the i-STAT 1 downloader/recharger has been replaced with a functionally equivalent infrared
transceiver since its last clearance in K223710.
Additionally, liquid quality control materials are sold separately as an optional quality control
methodology. The liquid controls available for use with the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge include i-
STAT hs-TnI Control Level 1, i-STAT hs-TnI Control level 2, i-STAT hs-TnI Control Level 3,
and the i-STAT hs-TnI Calibration Verification Levels 1-3.
B Principle of Operation:
The i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System is an immunoassay for cardiac troponin
I. The i-STAT hs-TnI test uses an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method with
electrochemical detection of the resulting enzyme signal. The test reports a quantitative
measurement of the sample concentration of cTnI in units of ng/L.
The -STAT hs-TnI cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System uses an anti-cTnI antibodies for labeling
and capture. The capture antibodies are coated on para-magnetic microparticles. Both label and
capture antibodies are contained within the cartridge on a biosensor chip. All the steps of the
ELISA are automated and conducted within the test cartridge. The ELISA is initiated when the
test cartridge is inserted into the analyzer. The sample is positioned over the biosensor chip to
dissolve the reagents. This forms the ELISA sandwich (detection antibody-label/antigen/capture
antibody). The sample and excess antibody-conjugate are then washed off the sensors. An
enzyme within the ELISA sandwich generates an electrochemically detectable product. The
biosensor chip measures the enzyme product which is proportional to the concentration of cTnI
within the sample.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System was evaluated following
the recommendations in CLSI EP06 2nd Edition guideline.
Linearity was evaluated using 11 whole blood and 11 lithium heparin plasma samples
ranging in concentrations from <2.9 ng/L (LoQ) to >1000 ng/L. The high whole blood
sample (B1) was a native whole blood sample spiked with a native plasma sample with high
concentration of cardiac troponin I and the low whole blood sample (B11) was an unaltered
native sample. The high plasma sample (P1) and low plasma sample (P11) were prepared by
separating plasma portion of the whole blood. The intermediate whole blood samples (B2 to
B10) and plasma samples (P2 to P11) were prepared by mixing high and low concentration
samples.
Each sample was tested in replicates of 3 per cartridge lot and a total of 9 replicates per
sample were obtained using three cartridge lots. The mean of the 9 replicates was used to
calculate the reported results. Data were analyzed using weighted least squares linear
regression.
Deviations from linearity were never observed to be greater than 6.44% within the claimed
measuring range from 2.9 to 1000 ng/L for whole blood.
Deviations from linearity were never observed to be greater than 13.07% within the claimed
measuring range from 2.9 to 1000 ng/L for plasma.

The sponsor also provided information to support the use of surrogate samples in the linearity
study. Additionally, the sponsor provided a sub-range linearity study results obtained with
fresh native samples and the results were found to be similar to the full range studies.
Hook Effect
A study was performed to support the claim that there was no hook effect with troponin
samples with concentrations up to 500,000 ng/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous and Exogenous Interference
The analytical specificity of the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System was
evaluated following the recommendations from the CLSI EP07-3rd ed guideline.
Each substance was tested at 2 levels of the analyte (approximately between 15-25 ng/L and
between 500-750 ng/L) using lithium heparin venous whole blood and lithium heparin
plasma samples.
The samples with high and low analyte levels were further divided into two groups: i.e., test
sample (with added interferent) and control sample (without interferent). Each sample level
was tested in replicates of 30 using two i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge lots on multiple i-STAT 1
analyzers. Test results from sample spiked with the potential interferent were compared to
test results from the control samples lacking the potential interferent.
Interference was considered non-significant if the bias between the test and control sample
was within ± 10% of the control sample. The following table lists the concentrations of each
substance at which no significant interference was found.

groups: i.e., test sample (with added interferent) and control sample (without interferent). Each
sample was tested in replicates of 30 using one i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge lot on multiple i-STAT
1 analyzers. Test results from sample spiked with the potential interferent were compared to test
results from the control samples lacking the potential interferent.
Interference was considered non-significant if the bias between the test and control sample were
within ± 10% of the control sample. The following table lists the concentrations of each

A study was performed to evaluate potential interference due to cross-reacting substances
following the recommendations in the CLSI EP07, 3rd Edition guideline. The interferents (listed
in the table below) were added to lithium heparin plasma or whole blood samples targeting cTnI
at low (< 5 ng/L), medium (15-25 ng/L) and high concentrations (500-750 ng/L). The low
samples were unaltered native samples, the medium range samples were spiked with native
troponin and the high range samples were spiked with recombinant troponin. Each sample was
tested in 10 replicates using one lot of i-STAT hs-TnI cartridges on the i-STAT 1 system. The
observed % cross-reactivity was ≤ 1% for all cross-reactants evaluated at each analyte level.

• Elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin >30 mg/dL in plasma may result in an increased rate
of star-outs (***). The reference range per CLSI EP37 for Bilirubin (Conjugated) is 0.0-2.4
μmol/L (0.0-0.2 mg/dL).
The sponsor describes that decreased results can be expected from unconjugated bilirubin
concentrations > 85.5 µmol/L (5 mg/dL). The sponsor explains that the reference range per CLSI
EP37 for Bilirubin (Unconjugated) is 0-34 μmol/L (0.0-2.0 mg/dL). Elevated levels of
unconjugated bilirubin may be observed in patients with hemolytic disorders (i.e. hemolytic
anemia), cholestatis, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation and secretion, such as
Gilbert’s syndrome, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, chronic viral hepatitis, or chronic alcohol
cirrhosis.
The following limitations are included in the labeling:
• Samples from patients who have been exposed to animals or who have received therapeutic
or diagnostic procedures employing immunoglobulins or reagents derived from
immunoglobulins may contain antibodies, e.g., HAMA or other heterophile antibodies,
which may interfere with immunoassays and produce erroneous results. The generation of
potentially interfering antibodies in response to bacterial infections has been reported. While
this product contains reagents that minimize the effect of these interferents and QC
algorithms designed to detect their effects, the possibility of interference causing erroneous
results should be evaluated carefully in cases where there are inconsistencies in the clinical
information.
• Troponin autoantibodies have been reported to be present in approximately 10% to 20% of
patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) and may lead to falsely low troponin
assay results.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
2.9 -1000.0 ng/L
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System is traceable to the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material SRM2921. The sponsor’s
traceability scheme was reviewed and found acceptable.
K240984 - Page 15 of 29

--- Page 16 ---
Stability
The sponsor has provided information to support the following sample stability claims in
their labeling:
• Lithium heparin whole blood and lithium heparin plasma: 4 hours at room temperature
(18-30oC)
• Non-anticoagulant whole blood: 3 minutes at room temperature (18-30oC).
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantification (LoQ) studies for
the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System were conducted following the
recommendations in the CLSI EP17-A2 guideline.
Limit of Blank (LoB)
The LoB was evaluated using fresh lithium heparin whole blood samples and plasma samples
from four (4) apparently healthy donors altered to achieve blank cardiac troponin I level
samples. The samples were tested using four (4) lots of the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridges. A total
of 80 measurements were obtained for each lot by testing samples across 3 days. The LoB
was calculated non-parametrically for each lot. The highest LoB values obtained across all
lots was 0.78 ng/L for whole blood and 0.57 ng/L for plasma.
Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD was evaluated using fresh lithium heparin whole blood and lithium heparin plasma
samples from four (4) individual healthy donors. The study was performed using three (3)
lots of the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridges. For each sample, a total of 60 measurements were
obtained from each of the three cartridge lots over three (3) days. The LoD was calculated
non-parametrically for each lot. The highest LoD values obtained across all lots was 1.61
ng/L for whole blood and 1.05 ng/L for plasma.
Limit of Quantification (LoQ)
The LoQ was evaluated using fresh lithium heparin whole blood and lithium heparin plasma
samples. For each sample type, 13 independent fresh low-analyte samples from individual
healthy donors were tested using 4 lots of the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridges. Each sample was
measured in 10 replicates per lot. The LoQ was determined independently for each cartridge
lot using a precision profile approach as the concentration where the %CV was less than or
equal to 20%. The highest LoQ values obtained across all lots was 2.90 ng/L for whole blood
and 1.18 ng/L for plasma.
The above studies support the following detection limits claims for the i-STAT hs-TnI
cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System:
Sample Type LoB LoD LoQ
Whole Blood 0.78 1.61 2.90
Plasma 0.57 1.05 1.18

Lithium Heparin Tube Type Equivalence (Lithium Heparin with Separator Gel vs Lithium
Heparin)
The matrix equivalency between whole blood and plasma samples collected in lithium
heparin tubes (primary tube) and lithium heparin tubes with separator gel (candidate tube)
was evaluated for the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System following the
recommendations in the CLSI EP35, 1st Edition guideline.
A total of 87 matched whole blood samples (8 contrived samples) collected from the clinical
study sites were tested. Plasma samples were prepared from the whole blood samples. Each
sample was tested in duplicate. A Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed using
the first result from the candidate specimen type (Y: lithium heparin tube with separator gel)
versus the first result from the primary specimen (X: lithium heparin tube). The regression
analysis results are summarized below:

Non anticoagulant equivalence
A study assessing the matrix equivalency between non-anticoagulated venous whole blood
specimens (candidate specimen type) to specimens collected into a lithium heparin tube
(primary specimen type) was performed. For a given subject, the pair of specimens were
collected in one syringe without anticoagulant and in one lithium heparin tube.
A total of 88 matched whole blood samples (8 contrived samples) collected from the clinical
study sites were tested. Each sample was tested in duplicate. A Passing-Bablok regression
analysis was performed using the first result from the candidate specimen types (Y: non
anticoagulated whole blood) versus the first result from the primary specimen (X: lithium
heparin whole blood). The regression analysis results are summarized below:

The following limitations are included in the labeling:
• Do not test non-anticoagulated samples beyond 3 minutes. Partially clotted samples will
impact i-STAT hs-TnI results.
• If performing i-STAT hs-TnI testing using both a specimen collected without anticoagulant
and a specimen collected with lithium heparin anticoagulant from a single patient, the i-
STAT hs-TnI test results observed for the specimen collected without anticoagulant may be
3.1% - 4.4% higher at the 99th percentile URLs compared to the specimen collected with
lithium heparin.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
A multi-center pivotal study using prospectively collected venous whole blood and plasma
specimens was conducted at 28 sites to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the i-STAT hs-TnI
cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System. The sites represented geographically diverse Emergency
Department (ED) associated with acute care hospitals, medical centers, tertiary care facilities,
and primary care clinics with patient populations reflecting regional, urban, and rural areas in
the US.
Venous whole blood specimens collected into lithium heparin tubes from 3585 subjects
presenting to the ED with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
were included in the clinical performance evaluation. Plasma was obtained from whole blood
by centrifugation. Each whole blood and plasma specimen was evaluated using candidate test
system. All subjects were adjudicated by a panel of board-certified cardiologists and
emergency medicine physicians, who reviewed the subject’s clinical presentation, medical
history, relevant clinical data, and locally measured standard of care (SOC) troponin test. The
adjudication outcome (MI or non-MI) was based on the Fourth Universal Definition of MI.
The adjudicators were blinded to the i-STAT High Sensitivity Troponin I assay results.
Adjudicators were also blinded to site diagnoses. The observed MI prevalence in this study
was 6.8% (157/2295) for females and 11.6% (150/1290) for males.
The results were analyzed using the serial sampling time points collected as part of the ED
visit. The clinical performance (clinical sensitivity, clinical specificity, positive predictive
value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV)) of the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge with the i-
STAT 1 System results in the diagnosis of MI in this trial is shown below. The results are
summarized in the following tables.
An analysis of device performance was performed separately for males and females using the
sex-specific 99th percentile cutoffs (female 13 ng/L, male 28 ng/L). The sensitivity and
specificity results are summarized in the following tables.

In the study there were 1,290 male patients; among them there were 150 patients with MI and
1140 patients without MI. In the study, there were 2295 female patients, among them there
were 157 patients with MI and 2138 patients without MI.
The sponsor provided the following information in their labeling:
• The study design followed the standard of care at each site where few specimens would
be obtained at later time points because most patients would not typically require further
serial cTnI testing after 6 hours. Therefore, the lower specificity at the > 6-hour time
point was the result of the disproportionate number of elevated and non-elevated
specimen carried over from previous time points. The i-STAT hs-TnI results should be
used in conjunction with information available from clinical evaluation and other
diagnostic procedures.
• Troponin results should always be used in conjunction with clinical data, signs, and
symptoms.

• Due to the release kinetics of cardiac troponin I, an initial test result may not be definitive
in diagnosing MI. Serial troponin measurements are suggested. The patient’s clinical
presentation (history, risk factors, physical exam, and ECG findings), a rise/fall pattern in
results, and noninvasive modalities should be considered in conjunction with troponin in
the diagnostic evaluation of suspected myocardial infarction in accordance with the
fourth universal definition of MI to help guide the choice of therapeutic options.
The sponsor included the following information regarding performance observed using
whole blood samples in the study.
• In the i-STAT hs-TnI clinical study, the percent of false negatives for females using the
sex-specific cutoff (13 ng/L) was up to 3.18% lower when compared to the false negative
rate for females using the overall cutoff of 21 ng/L. When using the female cutoff of 13
ng/L, 2.55% of females with MI had non-elevated i-STAT hs-TnI test results. When
using the overall cutoff of 21 ng/L, 5.73% of females with MI had non-elevated i-STAT
hs-TnI test results.
When using the female cutoff (13 ng/L), there were 4 false negative female subjects (out
of 157 female subjects adjudicated with MI). In these subjects, no result above the cutoff
was obtained with the i-STAT hs-TnI test. Among the 4 false negative female subjects
based on the female cutoff, all had at least one standard of care (SOC) troponin test with
a concentration above the cutoff of the tests used by the sites.
When using the overall cutoff (21 ng/L), there were 9 false negative female subjects (out
of 157 female subjects adjudicated with MI). In these subjects, no result above the cutoff
was obtained with the i-STAT hs-TnI test. Among the 9 false negative female subjects
based on the female cutoff, 8 subjects had at least one standard of care (SOC) troponin
test with a concentration above the cutoff of the tests used by the sites.
• In the i-STAT hs-TnI clinical study, the percent of false negatives for males using the
sex-specific cutoff (28 ng/L) was up to 2.00% higher when compared to the false
negative rate for males using the overall cutoff of 21 ng/L. When using the male cutoff of
28 ng/L, 9.33% of males with MI had non-elevated i-STAT hs-TnI test results. When
using the overall cutoff of 21 ng/L, 7.33% of males with MI had non-elevated i-STAT hs-
TnI test results.
When using the male cutoff (28 ng/L), there were 14 false negative male subjects (out of
150 male subjects adjudicated with MI). In these subjects, no result above the cutoff was
obtained with the i-STAT hs-TnI test. Among the 14 false negative male subjects based
on the male specific cutoff, 2 were early presenters and had no blood draw tested with the
i-STAT hs-TnI test when the SOC troponin test detected troponin concentration above
the SOC cutoff. The remaining 12 subjects had at least one SOC troponin test with a
concentration above the cutoff of the tests used by the sites.
When using the overall cutoff (21 ng/L), there were 11 false negative male subjects (out
of 150 male subjects adjudicated with MI). In these subjects, no result above the cutoff
was obtained with the i-STAT hs-TnI test. Among the 11 false negative male subjects

based on the male specific cutoff, 2 were early presenters and had no blood draw tested
with the i-STAT hs-TnI test when the SOC troponin test detected troponin concentration
above the SOC cutoff. The remaining 9 subjects had at least one SOC troponin test with a
concentration above the cutoff of the tests used by the sites.
• When using the female cutoff (13 ng/L), the lower bound of the one sided 97.5% CI for
the PPV was as low as 23.62% (at > 1 to 3 hours). Taking into consideration the lower
bound of the one sided 97.5% CI, up to 75.39% (at 0 to 1 hour), 76.38% (at > 1 to 3
hours), 73.97% (at > 3 to 6 hours), and 70.46% (at > 6 hours) of positive troponin results
could come from females that are not having an MI. When using the overall cutoff (21
ng/L), the lower bound of the one sided 97.5% CI for the PPV was as low as 32.18% (at 0
to 1 hour). Taking into consideration the lower bound of the one sided 97.5% CI, up to
67.82% (at 0 to 1 hour), 66.62% (at > 1 to 3 hours), 65.49% (at > 3 to 6 hours), and
66.85% (at > 6 hours) of positive troponin results could come from females that are not
having an MI.
• When using the male cutoff (28 ng/L), the lower bound of one sided 97.5% CI for the
PPV was as low as 25.54% (at > 6 hours). Taking into consideration the lower bound of
the one sided 97.5% CI, up to 65.44% (at 0 to 1 hour), 63.64% (at > 1 to 3 hours),
57.78% (at > 3 to 6 hours), and 74.46% (at > 6 hours) of positive troponin results could
come from males that are not having an MI. When using the overall cutoff (21 ng/L), the
lower bound of the one sided 97.5% CI for the PPV was as low as 24.51% (at > 6 hours).
Taking into consideration the lower bound of the one sided 97.5% CI, up to 70.83% (at 0
to 1 hour), 69.84% (at > 1 to 3 hours), 66.31% (at > 3 to 6 hours), and 75.49% (at > 6
hours) of positive troponin results could come from males that are not having an MI.
The sponsor included similar information for the results observed using plasma samples.
The following limitations are in the labeling regarding the clinical performance of this
device:
• When an increased cardiac troponin I value is encountered (e.g. exceeding the 99th
percentile URL) in the absence of myocardial ischemia, other etiologies of cardiac
damage should be considered2. Elevated troponin levels may be indicative of myocardial
injury associated with heart failure, acute renal failure, chronic kidney disease, sepsis,
myocarditis, arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism, or other clinical conditions.
Additionally, as documented in literature, in certain samples, a high molecular weight
complex comprised of immunoglobulin and cTnI (macrotroponin) can be present and
may result sin elevated cTnI measurements. The patient’s clinical presentation (history,
risk factors, physical exam, and ECG findings), a rise/fall pattern in results, and
noninvasive modalities should be considered in conjunction with troponin in the
diagnostic evaluation of suspected myocardial infarction to help guide the choice of
therapeutic options.
• False negative rates using the overall cutoff for females and sex-specific cutoff for males
were higher compared to the false negative rates using the sex-specific cutoff for females
and overall cutoff for males. False positive rates using the overall cutoff for males and
sex-specific cutoff for females were higher compared to the false positive rates using the
K240984 - Page 24 of 29

--- Page 25 ---
sex-specific cutoff for males and overall cutoff for females. Refer to the Clinical
Performance section above.
• Cardiac troponin may not appear in circulation for 4-6 hours following the onset of
symptoms of MI. Consequently, a single negative result may not be sufficient to rule out
MI. Per the fourth universal definition of MI, myocardial injury is considered acute when
there is evidence of elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) values with at least 1 value above the
99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) and there is a rise and/or fall of cTn values.
• The results of different cTnI assays are not comparable. Additionally, as cTnI and cTnT
are distinct molecules the results are not interchangeable, nor comparable. In addition,
significant variation in absolute troponin values may be observed for a given patient
specimen with different analytic methods.
• The test results should be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s symptoms, clinical
examination, and other findings.

Venous whole blood samples were collected into lithium heparin collection tubes. Corresponding
plasma from whole blood specimens were obtained by centrifugation. Each specimen was tested
in replicate of one using the candidate test system. The 99th percentiles described in the
following table for this population were determined using the nonparametric method as described
in EP28-A3c.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Hematocrit study
The effect of hematocrit on the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System was
assessed across a hematocrit (HCT) range of 15 – 60% packed cell volume (PCV). The study
was conducted using three (3) lots of i-STAT hs-TnI cartridges on i-STAT 1 Analyzer.
Lithium heparin venous whole blood samples from 5 donors were altered to target two
cardiac troponin I levels (low: 15 – 25 ng/L and high: 500 – 700 ng/L). Each sample was
evaluated at 8 HCT levels, with the nominal HCT levels at 45% PCV and low and high PCV
as test conditions. Each sample was measured in replicates of 5 from each of three (3)
cartridge lots (15 replicates per HcT level per donor per cardiac troponin I level).
The HCT sensitivity at each troponin I level was assessed by comparing the results at the low
and high HCT levels (test conditions) to the nominal HCT level (control condition). Results
showed the accuracy is insensitive to HcT levels between 15 - 57%. Increased imprecision
(>10% CV%) was observed for samples with hematocrit levels ≥57% and increased bias was
observed for samples with hematocrit levels ≥ 55%.
Limitations
The following limitation is provided in the labeling:
The i-STAT hs-TnI test has been characterized between 15 – 60% PCV. Increased
imprecision exceeding 10% has been observed for whole blood samples with hematocrit
values above 57% PCV.
K240984 - Page 26 of 29

[Table 1 on page 26]
Sex	N		99th		90%CI
			Percentile		
Female	490	13			(10, 17)
Male*	404	28			(19, 58)
Overall	895	21			(14, 30)

--- Page 27 ---
For patient with hematocrit over 55% PCV, the i-STAT hs-TnI result in whole blood may not
be accurate as a bias up to ±10% has been observed.
Patients with known hematocrit above 55% should only be tested using plasma samples.
If the hematocrit is unknown and suspected to be elevated*, and the i-STAT hs-TnI whole
blood result is within ±10% of the i-STAT hs-TnI 99th percentile URL (overall 21 ng/L,
female 13 ng/L, male 28 ng/L), obtain a hematocrit measurement and if > 55% PCV, test the
sample with plasma or an alternative method.
*Note: female hematocrit reference range is 38 – 46%PCV and male hematocrit reference
range is 43 – 51%PCV.
An elevated hematocrit can be due to but not limited to, loss of fluids, such as in dehydration,
diuretic therapy, and burns, or an increase in red blood cells, such as in cardiovascular and
renal disorders, polycythemia vera, and impaired ventilation.
2. Altitude Effect
The performance of the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System at an altitude of
approximately 10,000 feet (ft) above sea level using whole blood and plasma specimen was
evaluated across the assay reportable range. A barometric chamber was used to simulate an
altitude of approximately 10,000 (ft) above sea level (target altitude as the test condition) and
outside the chamber was used for sea level (Dallas, Texas) (as the control condition). The
results of the study demonstrate that the test yields accurate results up to approximately
10,000 feet above sea level.
Limitations
The following limitations are provided in the labeling:
• The frequency of suppressed results is affected by atmospheric pressure. Suppressed
result rate may increase with higher elevations (decreased barometric pressure) and may
become persistent if testing is performed at more than 7500 feet (2286 meters) above sea
level. Where unavailability of results is unacceptable, Abbott Point of Care recommends
having an alternate method.
• The i-STAT hs-TnI test has not been evaluated at altitude >10,000 feet. No impact on
performance was found up to 10,000 feet of altitude.
3. Operating Range Study
The performance of the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge with the i-STAT 1 System across its
operating temperature (16-30oC) and operating relative humidity (%RH of 10-90%) were
evaluated. The protocol and results were reviewed and found acceptable to support the test
yields accurate results across the operating temperature range of 16 – 30oC and % RH
between 10-90%.

4. Tilting Study
A study was performed to evaluate the robustness of the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge with the i-
STAT 1 System when the instrument is placed at a non-level angle during a cartridge test
cycle. The study was conducted using on lot of i-STAT hs-TnI cartridges and 40 i-STAT 1
Analyzers using whole blood samples. Each sample was evaluated at five tilt angles, with a
level of surface 0o as control condition 15o, 30o, -15o and -30o as test conditions. Two
additional decline angle test conditions (-20o and -25o) were evaluated for the low cardiac
troponin level. The impact of instrument tilt angle during testing was assessed by comparing
the i-STAT hs-TnI test results collected at the tilt angles (test conditions) to the test results
collected on a level surface (control condition). The results demonstrated that the candidate
device was not impacted by tilt angles ranging from +30 incline to -20o decline for all cardiac
troponin I levels.
Limitations
The following limitations are provided in the labeling:
• The analyzer must remain on a flat surface with the display facing up during testing.
Movement of the analyzer during testing may increase the frequency of suppressed
results or quality check codes. A level surface includes running the analyzer in the
downloader/recharger.
• The i-STAT hs-TnI test was characterized for tilt angle between -20o (display angled
down) and +30o (displayed angled up) versus a level surface. Increased bias was observed
for a tilt angle more than -20o (display angled down).
5. Vibration
A study was performed to evaluate the robustness of the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge with the i-
STAT 1 System when the instrument is exposed to vibration during a cartridge test cycle. The
study was conducted using one lot of i-STAT hs-TnI cartridges and 5 i-STAT 1 analyzers.
Each sample was evaluated at three vibration levels, with no vibration as a control condition
and 4.8 mm/s 10 mm/s and 15 mm/s as test conditions. The impact of vibration during testing
was assessed by comparing i-STAT hs-TnI results collected in the presence of vibration (test
conditions) to the results collected with no vibration (control condition). The results of the
study demonstrated that the i-STAT hs-TnI test in the i-STAT hs-TnI cartridge when tested
on the i-STAT 1 analyzer is insensitive to vibration up to 15 mm/s across the range of cTnI
levels tested.
