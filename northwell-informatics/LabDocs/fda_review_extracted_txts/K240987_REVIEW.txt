A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access sTfR assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels in human serum and
plasma (heparin) using the Access Immunoassay Systems. This assay is intended as an aid in the
diagnosis of Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), and for the differential diagnosis of IDA and
Anemia of Chronic Disease (ACD).
This assay may also be used in conjunction with an Access Ferritin measurement to provide a
calculated sTfR/log ferritin index. This index is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of IDA, and
for the differential diagnosis of IDA and ACD.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (K221225)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Each Access sTfR reagent kit contains two reagent packs (50 tests/pack). Each pack contains the
following:
• R1a: Paramagnetic particles coated with streptavidin: biotinylated soluble transferrin
receptor monoclonal antibody, proteins (mouse, goat, bovine), BSA, 0.1% sodium
azide and 0.17% ProClin* 300.

Access sTfR QC1 (10 nmol/L)
o
Access sTfR QC2 and QC3 (25 and 90 nmol/L)

K240987 - Page 2 of 8

--- Page 3 ---
The modification of the Access sTfR includes:
(a) a new substrate replacement (Lumi-Phos PRO)
(b) run on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer with an updated analytical measuring
interval of 0.05 – 150 nmol/L.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access sTfR assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay. A sample
is added to a reaction vessel along with paramagnetic particles coated with anti-sTfR antibody.
During incubation, the sTfR antigen in the sample binds to the immobilized anti-sTfR antibody
on the solid phase. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-sTfR antibody is then added and reacts
with a different antigenic site on the sTfR molecule. After incubation, materials bound to the
solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured
with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte
in the sample. Analyte concentration is automatically determined from a stored calibration.

All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP05-A3.
a) Within-Laboratory Precision:
The studies were performed by testing six levels of human serum samples in a minimum
of two replicates per run, two runs per day for 20 days, resulting a minimum of 80
datapoints for each sample. Three reagent lots of the modified Access sTfR and three
instruments were used in the study. The data were analyzed for repeatability (within-run),
between-run, between-day, and within-laboratory precision. The mean (nmol/L), standard
deviation (SD) (nmol/L) and percent coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated for
each sample. The representative data of within-laboratory precision using one lot of
reagents on one instrument are summarized in table below.

b) Lot-to-Lot Precision:
The lot-to-lot precision of Lumi-Phos PRO Substrate was assessed in K223921.
The lot-to-lot precision of the modified Access sTfR was evaluated using three lots of
reagents on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. Six serum samples at different
concentrations were tested in five replicates per run, one run per day over five days,
resulting N=75 datapoints per sample on one instrument. The same study was also
performed on two additional instruments. The %CV for between-lot imprecision is
≤1.1% for all samples.
c) Instrument-to-Instrument Precision:
The instrument-to-instrument reproducibility was evaluated by testing six serum samples
at different concentrations on three DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers. Each
sample was tested in five replicates per run, one run per day over five days, resulting
N=75 datapoints using one lot of reagents. The same study was also repeated using two
additional reagent lots. The representative data of instrument-to-instrument
reproducibility using one lot of reagents are summarized in the table below.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the modified Access sTfR on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer was
performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP06, 2nd Edition. Three dilution series were
prepared by mixing one High serum sample with a Low serum sample. One dilution series
included eight dilution levels covering the analytical measuring interval (AMI) of the
modified Access sTfR (0.03 – 133.2 nmol/L). The second dilution series included dilution
samples covering low end of AMI (0.02 – 28 nmol/L). The third dilution series included
dilution samples covering high end of AMI (72.8 – 184.8 nmol/L). For all dilution series, the
lowest samples were run in replicates of eight, and all other dilution levels were run in
replicates of four on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer using one lot of reagents.
For each level, the ‘measured value’ (mean sTfR nmol/L) was compared to its predicted
value for deviation percentage using a weighted linear regression analysis. This deviation
was then compared to the allowable deviation from linearity (ADL). The data showed the
linearity interval from 0.02 – 184.8 nmol/L with the deviations from linearity within ±10%.
The results support the linearity of the claimed analytical measuring interval (AMI): 0.05 –
150 nmol/L.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Refer to K080634
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The reportable range is the same as the claimed analytical measuring interval (AMI): 0.05 –
150 nmol/L.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) Traceability:
The traceability was established in K080634. There is no change to the traceability of the
modified Access sTfR.
b) Stability:

The Access sTfR and the Lumi-Phos PRO substrate are packaged separately. Access
sTfR kit stability was established in K080634. The proposed change is to replace
substrate (Lumi-Phos 530) of the Access sTfR with a new substrate (Lumi-Phos PRO) for
the assay run on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer. The shelf-life claims and on-
board stability claims of Lumi-Phos PRO substrate were established in K221225.
6. Detection Limit:
CLSI guideline EP17-A2 was followed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of
Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the Access Ferritin.
a) LoB:
Five analyte depleted ultrafiltered samples (prepared from five unique native serum
samples) were tested in five replicates per run, one run per day over three days using two
modified Access sTfR reagent lots on two DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers
(N=75 datapoints for each reagent lot and each instrument). The LoB was determined
based on the 95% nonparametric percentile of the replicates for each of the two reagent
lots. The claimed LoB for the modified Access sTfR on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
Analyzer is 0.04 nmol/L.
b) LoD:
Eight serum samples containing low levels of sTfR were tested in nine replicates per run,
one run per day for five days using three modified Access sTfR on three DxI 9000
Access Immunoassay Analyzers. LoD was calculated from LoB + “SD multiplied by the
95th percentile of the standard normal distribution”. The claimed LoD for the modified
Access sTfR on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.05 nmol/L.
c) LoQ:
Thirteen serum samples containing low levels of sTfR were tested in replicates of nine
per run, one run per day, over five total days on each reagent lot and instrument using
three reagent lots and three instruments for a minimum of 40 total datapoints for each
sample on each lot. A variance components model was used to estimate the within-run
and within-laboratory (total) %CV for each sample on each instrument and reagent lot
combination. The estimated LoQ of the modified Access sTfR was set to be the sTfR
concentration which met the within-laboratory imprecision of 20% CV. The claimed LoQ
for the modified Access sTfR on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.05
nmol/L.
