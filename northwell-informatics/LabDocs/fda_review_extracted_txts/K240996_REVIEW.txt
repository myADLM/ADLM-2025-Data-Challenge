B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent
immunoassay for the quantitative determination of thyroglobulin antibody levels in human serum
and plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems. The measurement of thyroid autoantibodies
may aid in the diagnosis of Hashimoto’s disease, nontoxic goiter, and Graves’ disease.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

For In Vitro Diagnostic Use
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer (K221225)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Each Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II (TgAb II) reagent kit contains two reagent packs (100
determinations, 50 tests/pack). Each pack contains the following:
• R1a (3.25 mL): Paramagnetic particles coated with streptavidin and coupled to
biotinylated human thyroglobulin, suspended in a TRIS buffer with
protein (bovine) and preservatives
• R1b (13.25 mL): Human thyroglobulin alkaline phosphatase (bovine) conjugate in a
TRIS buffer with protein (bovine) and preservatives
• R1c (4.5 mL): TRIS buffer with bovine protein and preservatives
• R1d (3.1 mL): TRIS buffer with blocking polymer and preservatives
Materials needed but not supplied with reagent kit.
• Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II Calibrators: at 0, 50, 250, 500, 1000, and 2500 IU/mL
• Quality Control (QC) materials: commercial control material
• Substrate: Lumi-Phos PRO
• UniCel DxI Wash Buffer II
The modification of the Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II is to replace substrate (Lumi-Phos
530) with a new substrate, Lumi-Phos PRO, on the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic
(“sandwich”) assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel with paramagnetic particles coated
with the thyroglobulin protein. The TgAb in the sample binds to the thyroglobulin coated on the
K240996 - Page 2 of 8

--- Page 3 ---
particles. After incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while
unbound materials are washed away. The thyroglobulin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate is added
and binds to the TgAb. After a second incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in
a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then the chemiluminescent
substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a
luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of analyte in the
sample. Analyte concentration is automatically determined from a stored calibration.

All results presented below met the manufacturer’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP05-A3.
a) Within-Laboratory Precision:
The studies were performed at a single site using one lot of the modified Access
Thyroglobulin Antibody II (TgAb II) reagent on one DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay
Analyzer. Five samples (four native serum sample pools and one contrived serum

2. Linearity:
The linearity of the modified Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II assay was assessed in
accordance with the CLSI Guideline EP06, 2nd Ed. One individual native low sample, four
low native pooled samples, and five high pooled native samples were used to prepare five
overlapping dilution series, tiled across the AMI. For each series, the lowest sample was
tested in replicates of eight, while all other samples were tested in replicates of four on one
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer using one reagent lot and one calibrator lot. The
data were analyzed by weighted least squares (WLS) regression by comparing observed
results to expected concentrations for each linearity panel. Deviation from linearity predicted
from WLS regression was calculated by determining the difference between observed and
linear fit values for each dilution series, as well as a composite regress across all dilution
series. The results are summarized in the table below:

The data support a linear interval from 0.04 to 2,911.95 IU/mL with the deviations from
linearity within ± 10% for analyte concentration ≥15 IU/mL and ± 0.7 IU/mL for analyte
concentration <15 IU/mL. The study results support the linearity of the claimed AMI: 1.5 –
2500 IU/mL.

Traceability was established in K112933. The traceability of these modifications to the
Access Thyroglobulin Antibody II assay is unchanged.
b) Stability:
The Access TgAb II Reagent kit and the Lumi-Phos PRO substrate are packaged
separately. Access TgAb II Reagent kit stability was established in K213517. The
proposed change introduces a new substrate (Lumi-Phos PRO). The shelf-life claims and
on-board stability claims for Lumi-Phos PRO substrate were established in K221225.
6. Detection Capability:
CLSI guideline EP17-A2 was followed to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of
Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the modified Access TgAb II on DxI
9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer.
a) LoB:
Five blank individual native serum samples were tested in five replicates per run, one run
per day over three days using two modified Access TgAb II reagent lots (N=75 datapoints
for each lot) on two DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers. The LoB for each reagent
lot was calculated using the 95% percentile of all datapoints for each of the two reagents.
The claimed non-parametric LoB for the modified Access TgAb II on DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.1 IU/mL.
b) LoD:
Eleven native serum samples containing low levels of TgAb II analyte were tested over
five days, one run per day, and a minimum of eight replicates per run for each of two
Access TgAb II reagent lots. Two DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers were used
for a minimum of N=492 datapoints for each reagent lot. The non-parametric method of
LoD per CLSI EP17-A2 was used to determine the maximum observed LoD between the
two lots. The claimed LoD for the modified Access TgAb II on the DxI 9000 Access
Immunoassay Analyzer is 0.2 IU/mL.
c) LoQ:
Thirteen native serum samples or pools containing low levels of TgAb II analyte were
tested in nine replicates per run, one run per day, for five days on each of two Access
TgAb II reagent lots, on two DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers. This resulted in
a minimum of N=540 datapoints for each sample for each reagent lot. For LoQ
determination, a precision model was used to estimate the within-laboratory %CV for
each sample for each instrument and reagent lot combination. The precision profile was
used to calculate an LoQ based on a 20% CV threshold. The claimed LoQ for the
modified Access TgAb II on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is 1.5 IU/mL.

CLSI guideline EP09c, 3rd Edition was followed to compare the Access TgAb II assay on the
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer to the predicate device, the Access TgAb II on the
