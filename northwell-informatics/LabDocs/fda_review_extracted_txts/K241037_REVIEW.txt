C Type of Test:
Potentiometry: Potassium, Sodium, Calcium
Amperometry: Glucose and Lactate
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The ABL90 FLEX PLUS System is an in vitro diagnostic, portable, automated analyzer that
quantitatively measures electrolytes (cK+, cNa+, cCa2+), glucose, and lactate in heparinized
arterial and venous whole blood.
The ABL90 FLEX PLUS System is intended for use by trained technologists, nurses, physicians
and therapists. It is intended for use in a laboratory environment, near patient, or point-of-care
setting.
These tests are only performed under a physician's order.
Potassium (cK+): Potassium measurements are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the
diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium
levels.
Sodium (cNa+): Sodium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism,
diabetes insipidus, adrenal hypertension, Addison's disease, dehydration, inappropriate
antidiuretic secretion, or other diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.
Calcium (cCa2+): Calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid
disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany.
Glucose (cGlu): Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate
metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus and idiopathic hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic
islet cell carcinoma.
Lactate (cLac): The lactate measurements measure the concentration of lactate. Lactate
measurements are used to evaluate the acid-base status and are used in the diagnosis and
treatment of lactic acidosis (abnormally high acidity of the blood).

D Special Instrument Requirements:
ABL90 FLEX PLUS System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ABL90 FLEX PLUS System consists of the ABL90 FLEX PLUS analyzer, sensor cassette
(SC) and solution pack (SP) consumables, and related accessories for the analyzer. The ABL90
FLEX PLUS is a portable, automated system intended for in vitro testing of samples of balanced
heparinized whole blood for the parameters cK+, cNa+, cCa2+, glucose and lactate.
The ABL90 FLEX PLUS Analyzer is a portable analyzer that contains the inlet module, the
sample mixer, the fluid transport system, a barcode reader, a printer, and all the electronics and
software to control the analyzer and for data management. The ABL90 FLEX PLUS Analyzer
has an automated sample inlet mechanism, which can collect the blood through two different
measuring modes: the S65 syringe mode and the SP65 short probe mode.
The ABL90 FLEX Sensor Cassette (SC) includes sensors for potentiometric measurements of
cK+, cNa+, and cCa2+ and the amperometric measurements of cGlu and cLac. The SC comes in
different versions. The versions are the same with respect to physical and chemical
characteristics and differ only in a memory chip that encodes the maximum number of tests and
availability of sensors for use in each SC.
The ABL90 FLEX PLUS Solution Pack (SP) provides solutions and gas mixtures for calibration,
rinse and quality control of the measuring system, and sealed pouches for collection of waste
from the analyzer. The SP comes in two versions that differ in the amount of liquid chemicals to
support the maximum number of activities, where an “activity” can be a patient sample, QC
measurement, a calibration, or a rinse, all of which use liquids from the SP.
This submission addresses modifications in the cGlu, cLac, cK+, cNa+, and cCa2+ electrode
manufacturing process that were made to the device cleared in K160153.
The ABL90 FLEX PLUS Analyzer for the quantitative measurement of pH, blood gas (pO2),
Oximetry (sO2, ctHb, FO2Hb, FCOHb, FMetHb, and FHHb) was cleared in K240998.
B Principle of Operation:
There are two different measuring principles employed by the ABL90 FLEX PLUS system to
measure cGlu, cLac, cK+, cNa+, and cCa2:
Potentiometry: The potential of an electrode chain is measured by a voltmeter and related to the
concentration of the sample (the Nernst equation). The potentiometric measuring principle is
applied in cK+, cNa+, cCa2+ sensors.
K241037 - Page 3 of 13

--- Page 4 ---
Amperometry: The magnitude of an electrical current that flows through an electrode chain is
proportional to the concentration of the substance that is oxidized or reduced at an electrode in
the chain. The amperometric measuring principle is applied in the cGlu and cLac sensors.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
i. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two point-of-care precision (POC) studies were conducted at three sites using at least three
POC operators. The first was a multi-day precision study performed using four
concentrations of aqueous control solutions and 3 reagent lots. At each site, each level was
tested as two replicates per run, two runs per day, for twenty days. The second was a multi-
day precision study conducted with balanced heparinized whole blood at levels within the
reportable range of each analyte using both the S65 and SP65 sampling modes. The results
supported that modifications made to the ABL90 FLEX PLUS did not impact the precision
of cGlu, cLac, cK+, cNa+, and cCa2+.
ii. Linearity:
Linearity testing was conducted in general accordance with CLSI EP06-A2. The results
supported that modifications made to the ABL90 FLEX PLUS did not impact the linearity of
cGlu, cLac, cK+, cNa+, and cCa2+.
iii. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference testing was conducted in two parts: paired-difference testing and dose-response
experiments.
a. The paired-difference testing was conducted on all potential interferents. Matched
samples were tested, one with no interferent and the other with the interferent. If no
interference was found, no further testing was performed.
b. The dose-response experiment was only conducted on interferents found to have an
effect via the paired-difference testing. This was carried out to determine the
concentration at which clinically significant interference occurred.
Freshly drawn heparinized human plasma samples or whole blood samples were used as
starting material for all interference studies. Interference testing was conducted at two levels
(i.e., low and high) for Ca2+, K+, Na+, Glu and Lac. The results supported that
modifications made to the ABL90 FLEX PLUS did not significantly impact the substances
that interfere with cGlu, cLac, cK+, cNa+, and cCa2+. The following information is
provided in the labeling.

The sponsor included the following limitations in their labeling:
• Do not use samples collected in fluorinated sampling tubes as exposure to high
concentrations of fluoride causes falsely low cGlu and cLac results and may cause falsely
low cGlu and cLac results in subsequent sample measurements.
• A change in the pH of blood has the physiological effect of changing the concentrations
of ionized calcium. An increase in 1 unit of pH results in a decrease of approximately 2
mg/dL in cCa2+.
• Healthy patients have a glycolic acid concentration of 0.034 to 0.093 mg/dL. Ethylene
glycol poisoning is a rare condition affecting about 20 people per million annually in the
USA. Ethylene glycol poisoning may exhibit very high levels of glycolic acid. Levels up
to 289 mg/dL have been reported. A glycolic acid level of 289 mg/dL may interfere with

confirmed, do not use lactate results for that sample or any subsequent samples measured
within 5 minutes.
• Normal physiological levels of bromide do not interfere. Exposure to high concentrations
of Bromide causes falsely low cLac results and may cause falsely low cLac results on any
subsequent samples measured within 5 minutes.
iv. Assay Reportable Range:
The results from the studies support the claimed measuring ranges:
cCa2+: 2.00 – 9.94 mg/dL
cK+: 2.1 – 10.5 mmol/L

Heparinized arterial and venous whole blood specimens from a total of 353 subjects were
collected across 4 POC sites with at least two POC operators per site were compared to
whole blood specimens tested on a comparative method. Each sample were measured once
on the ABL90 FLEX PLUS in both the S65 and SP65 modes and once on the predicate
device in the same mode. Less than 10% contrived samples were used for each analyte.
Evaluations were performed per each combination of parameter, blood type, and sampling
