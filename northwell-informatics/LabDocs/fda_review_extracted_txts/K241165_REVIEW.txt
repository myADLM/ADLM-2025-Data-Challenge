III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Atellica® IM High‑Sensitivity Troponin I (TnIH) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the
quantitative measurement of cardiac troponin I in human serum or plasma (lithium heparin)
using the Atellica® IM Analyzer. The assay can be used to aid in the diagnosis of acute
myocardial infarction (AMI).

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
A clinical study was performed to evaluate the prognostic performance of the device using
the same clinical cohort described in K171566. Patients presenting to the emergency
department with signs and symptoms suggestive of ACS were followed up for 30‑, 90‑, 182‑,
and 365‑day progression to ACM and MACE (consisting of myocardial infarction, urgent
revascularization, cardiac death, or heart failure hospitalization). At each time point, the risk
(cumulative incidence) and hazard ratios were calculated for populations with baseline cardiac
troponin I levels ≤ or > the overall 99th percentile value. Lithium heparin plasma and serum
specimens were collected and baseline cardiac troponin I levels were established using the
Atellica IM Analyzer testing the first blood draw for each subject presenting to the
emergency department. The median time of the first blood draw was 93 minutes after
presentation to the emergency department.
K241165 - Page 5 of 15

--- Page 6 ---
Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to display the absolute risk (cumulative incidence) of
ACM and MACE outcomes. Analyses were performed separately for both serum and lithium
heparin plasma sample types using the overall 99th percentile value. Tables for pre- and post-
test risk and unadjusted hazard ratios, adjusted hazard ratios (adjusted for prior
revascularization, prior heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),
hypertension and sex), multivariable Cox proportional hazards (PH) model parameters, and
event types, as well as Kaplan-Meier curves, are presented for the following populations based
on the overall 99th percentile value. Smoking, diabetes, Body Mass Index (BMI), race, and
age were also evaluated and were not significantly associated with cumulative ACM/MACE
for any cohort in this clinical population. Prior MI, statins, and depressed left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) were evaluated and removed from the model due to
multicollinearity. The cohorts and results are summarized below.
• Cohort A: Study population excluding subjects with adjudicated AMI and only
including subjects with prior history of MACE
• Cohort B: Study population excluding subjects with adjudicated AMI and prior
history of MACE
• Cohort C: Study population excluding subjects with adjudicated AMI
Cohort A (Study population excluding subjects with adjudicated AMI and only including
subjects with prior history of MACE)
