D Special Instrument Requirements:
Alinity i system
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Alere NT-proBNP for Alinity i assay is an automated, two-step immunoassay for the in vitro
quantitative determination of NT-proBNP in human serum and plasma (using chemiluminescent
microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology.
Reagents:
Microparticles: Anti-NT-proBNP (sheep, monoclonal) coated microparticles in Bis-TRIS buffer
with protein (bovine) stabilizer, non-specific binding blocking agents, and surfactant. Minimum
concentration: 0.05 % solids. Preservative: sodium azide.
Conjugate: Anti-NT-proBNP (mouse, monoclonal) acridinium labeled conjugate in MES buffer
with protein (bovine) stabilizer and surfactant. Minimum concentration: 0.12 μg/mL.
Preservatives: antimicrobial agents.
Materials required but not supplied with the reagent kit include Alere NT-proBNP for Alinity i
calibrators and quality controls, Alinity pre-trigger and trigger solution, Alinity-i series
concentrated wash buffer and Alinity i multi-assay manual diluent.
B Principle of Operation:
Sample and anti-NT-proBNP coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined and incubated.
The NT-proBNP present in the sample binds to the anti-NT-proBNP coated microparticles. The
mixture is washed. Anti-NT-proBNP acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to create a reaction
mixture and incubated. Following a wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are added.

The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit (RLU). There is a
direct relationship between the amount of NT-proBNP in the sample and the RLU detected by
the system optics.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Laboratory Precision (20-Day)
A study was performed based on guidance from CLSI EP05-A3.
Three controls and 8 human plasma panels (7 native panels and 1 panel supplemented with
NT-proBNP analyte) were tested in 2 replicates at 2 separate times per day over 20 days (for
a total of 80 measurements per sample). Testing was conducted using 3 lots of the candidate
device, 1 lot of the Alere NT-proBNP for Alinity i Calibrators, 1 lot of the Alere NT-proBNP
for Alinity i Controls, and 1 Alinity i instrument.
Panels (Panel A to Panel G) were prepared by pooling NT-proBNP K EDTA plasma
2
specimens and diluting with human K EDTA plasma as necessary to achieve the target
2
concentrations. Panel H was prepared by spiking K EDTA plasma with a synthetic
2
NT‑proBNP peptide. The sponsor provided evidence to show that the contrived samples
mimic patient samples.

concentration and the expected concentration of each sample were calculated. At each
concentration, the deviation from linearity was less than 11.3%.
The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 15.8 to 35,000.0
pg/mL.
Sample Dilution
Plasma samples with NT-proBNP concentrations up to 70,000 pg/mL can be measured after
a 1:2 auto dilution, and samples with NT-proBNP concentrations up to 350,000 pg/mL can
be measured using a 1:10 manual dilution. The percent recovery of diluted samples ranged
from 92.1% to 103.4%.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed based on guidance from CLSI EP07, 3rd ed.
Endogenous Substances
Interference from endogenous substances was assessed using K EDTA plasma samples at
2
two levels of NT-proBNP analyte (approximately 125 pg/mL and 2000 pg/mL). Each sample
was divided into 2 aliquots: one aliquot for the test sample (with added interferent) and one
aliquot for the control sample (without added interferent). Each sample was tested in
replicates of 30 using one Alinity i Analyzer, three reagent lots, and one calibrator lot.
No significant interference (defined by the sponsor as a difference within ± 10% between the
mean for the test sample versus the mean of the reference samples) was observed at the
following concentrations:

Cross-Reactants
A study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the Alere NT-proBNP for Alinity i
assay in the presence of potential cross-reactants.
Testing was conducted using K EDTA samples at two levels of NT-proBNP (125 pg/mL and
2
2000 pg/mL). Each sample was divided into 2 aliquots: one aliquot for the test sample
(spiked with cross-reactant) and one aliquot for the control sample (spiked with the same
diluent used for the preparation of cross-reactant in stock solutions). Each sample was tested
in replicates of 30 using 1 reagent lot, 1 calibrator lot, 1 control lot, and 1 Alinity i
instrument.
The % Recovery was calculated as:
% Recovery = 100 x (test mean / control mean)
The observed % recovery of NT-proBNP was within 100% ± 10% for all cross-reactants
evaluated at each analyte level:
Potential Cross-Reactant Cross-Reactant Concentration
Adrenomedullin 1000 pg/mL
Aldosterone 600 pg/mL
Angiotensin I 600 pg/mL
Angiotensin II 600 pg/mL
Angiotensin III 1000 pg /mL
ANP 28 3100 ng/mL
Arg-Vasopressin 1000 pg/mL
BNP 32 3500 ng/mL

Renin 50 000 pg/mL
Urodilatin 3500 ng/mL
High Dose Hook Effect
The Alere NT-proBNP for Alinity i assay was evaluated for high dose hook effect using
K EDTA plasma samples with 4 concentration levels of NT-proBNP. No high dose hook
2
effect was observed on samples up to 372,620 pg/mL of NT-proBNP.

6. Detection Limit:
The LoB, LoD, and LoQ study was performed based on guidance from CLSI EP17-A2.
Limit of Blank (LoB)
The LoB study was performed on 4 analyte-free K EDTA plasma specimens, using 3 reagent
2
lots, 1 calibrator lot, 1 control lot, and 2 Alinity i instruments. Testing occurred over 3 days.
Samples were tested in 5 replicates on each day of testing, for a total of 60 replicates. The
LoB was determined non-parametrically for each reagent lot separately and the highest value
obtained from three lots was taken as the LoB value. The LoB for the Alere NT-proBNP for
Alinity i assay was estimated to be 0.1 pg/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD study was performed on 18 low-level panels (2 samples at each of 9 unique target
concentration levels of approximately 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0, 12.0, 16.0, 20.0, and 24.0
pg/mL), using 3 reagent lots, 1 calibrator lot, 1 control lot, and 2 Alinity i instruments.
Testing occurred over 3 days. The 18 low-analyte samples were tested in 10 replicates on
each day of testing, for a total of 60 measurements per sample per reagent lot. The parametric
approach described in CLSI EP17-A2 was followed to determine the LoD. The highest
observed LoD of the three lots was the reported LoD for the assay. The LoD for the Alere
NT-proBNP for Alinity i assay was estimated to be 3.6 pg/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoQ)
The LoQ study was performed on 18 low-level panels (2 samples at each of 9 unique target
concentration levels of approximately 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0, 12.0, 16.0, 20.0, and 24.0
pg/mL), using 3 reagent lots, 1 calibrator lot, 1 control lot, and 2 Alinity i instruments.
Testing occurred over 3 days. The 18 low-analyte samples were tested in 10 replicates on
each day of testing, for a total of 60 measurements per sample per reagent lot. The LoQ was
determined as the lowest concentration of analyte at which the maximum allowable precision
of 20% CV was met. The highest value obtained from three lots was the reported LoQ for the
assay. The LoQ for the Alere NT-proBNP for Alinity i assay was estimated to be 15.8
pg/mL.

In the study, samples were collected from 63 subjects, representative of the intended use
population. A primary tube (control condition, K EDTA) and a minimum of 1 candidate tube
2
(test condition) were collected from each enrolled subject. Testing of specimens collected in
different tube types was initiated within 2 hours of draw. Two replicates from each specimen
tube type were tested. Testing was conducted using 2 Alinity i instruments, 2 reagent lots, 3
calibrator lots, and 3 control lots.
The results were analyzed using Passing-Bablok regression analysis comparing the first
replicate of the evaluation tube to the first replicate of the control tube (K EDTA).

supporting the stability of the samples for the storage time and condition were provided by
the sponsor.
The results were determined from 2127 ED subjects. Of the 2127 ED subjects, 1030 (48.4%)
were female and 1097 (51.6%) were male, ranging in age from 19 to 97 years. Individuals in
the population were White (53.1%), Black or African American (39.45%), Asian (1.7%),
American Indian or Alaska Native (0.8%), Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (0.3%),
or represented by other races (0.9%), with the remaining 3.6% of Unknown / Not Reported
race. A total of 1934 (90.9%) ED subjects were not Hispanic or Latino, and 168 (7.9%) ED
subjects were Hispanic or Latino, with the remaining 25 (1.2%) ED subjects of Unknown /
Not Reported ethnicity.
The clinical study specimen testing was performed with clinical specimens that were
randomly distributed across 3 clinical testing sites using 3 lots of the Alere NT-proBNP for
Alinity i Reagents, 2 lots of the Alere NT-proBNP for Alinity i Calibrators, 2 lots of the
Alere NT-proBNP for Alinity i Controls, and 1 Alinity i instrument at each clinical site. One
replicate of each specimen was tested with the investigational device.
Adjudication was performed by a panel of 10 board-certified cardiologists. A determination
of HF (acute exacerbation or new onset) or non-HF was rendered for each subject. The
adjudicators were blinded to the diagnosis and HF severity of the local attending physician in
the ED, and the determination of other members of the adjudication panel. For subjects
determined to have HF, severity was assessed based on New York Heart Association
(NYHA) classification (I, II, III, IV) and a determination of new or worsening HF.
The descriptive statistics for the Alere NT-proBNP for Alinity i test results (pg/mL) were
determined within and across sex by age group and are summarized in the following table:

The sponsor included the following statements in their instructions for use concerning the
performance of their device in ED settings in certain clinical subgroups:
• Patients with a history of HF had a higher rate of false positives compared to patients
without a history of HF. Of the 332 total patients with a history of HF and adjudicated
as non-HF, 121 (36.4%) had NT-proBNP concentrations greater than or equal to age-
dependent cutoffs. Of the 915 total patients with no history of HF and adjudicated as
non-HF, 113 (12.3%) had NT-proBNP concentrations greater than or equal to age-
dependent cutoffs. This difference is likely due to long-standing chronic elevation of
NT-proBNP in patients with a previous diagnosis of HF. Results should always be
assessed in conjunction with patient’s medical history, clinical examination, and other
findings.
• Patients with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 had a higher rate of false
positives compared to patients with an eGFR greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73
m2. Of the 258 total patients with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and
adjudicated as non-HF, 85 (32.9%) had NT-proBNP concentrations greater than or
equal to age-dependent cutoffs. Of the 981 total patients with an eGFR greater than or
equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and adjudicated as non-HF, 149 (15.2%) had NT-
proBNP concentrations greater than or equal to age-dependent cutoffs. Eight patients
adjudicated as non-HF (0.6%) had an unknown eGFR. Patients with an eGFR less
than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 had a higher rate of false negatives (9.0% [10/111])
compared to patients with an eGFR greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (5.6%
[41/726]). All 10 of the false negatives in the eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
group were from patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2. In patients
with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, caution should be used when interpreting
NT-proBNP results. Results should always be assessed in conjunction with the
patient’s medical history, clinical examination, and other findings.
• Patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 had a higher rate of false
negatives compared to patients with a BMI less than 30 kg/m2. Of the total observed
false negatives (51/880), 41 (80.4%) were from patients with a BMI greater than or
equal to 30 kg/m2, 7 (13.7%) were from patients with a BMI less than 30 kg/m2, and 3
(5.9%) were from patients with an unknown BMI. In patients with a BMI less than 30
kg/m2, the age greater than 75 years group had a higher rate of false negatives (6.7%
[2/30]) than the other age groups. Results should always be assessed in conjunction
with the patient’s medical history, clinical examination, and other findings. In patients
with obesity, natriuretic peptides should be interpreted with caution.
The sponsor also included the following limitation in their labeling:
• Elevated NT-proBNP concentrations may be associated with impaired renal function
(estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), history of HF
and other conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary
embolism, valvular heart disease, myocarditis, pulmonary hypertension, stroke, and
sepsis, which may lead to false positive results. Obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30
kg/m2), and other conditions such as flash pulmonary edema, pericarditis, and cardiac
K241176 - Page 29 of 32

tamponade may lower NT-proBNP concentrations, which may lead to false negative
results.

D Clinical Cut-Off:
The sponsor describes the following cut-offs for patients presenting to ED settings where new
onset or exacerbation of HF is suspected:
Age Group NT-proBNP
Interpretation
(Years) (pg/mL)
All < 300.0 Negative: HF unlikely
18 to < 50 ≥ 300.0 to < 450.0 Grayzone: Indeterminate
50 to 75 ≥ 300.0 to < 900.0 Consider other causes of
> 75 ≥ 300.0 to < 1800.0 NT-proBNP elevation.
18 to < 50 ≥ 450.0 Positive: HF likely
50 to 75 ≥ 900.0
> 75 ≥ 1800.0
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A reference interval study was performed based on guidance from CLSI EP28-A3c.
K EDTA plasma specimens were obtained from a total of 861 apparently healthy individuals (≥
2
18 years old, 442 females and 419 males) from 3 external clinical sites located in the US. The
age-range distribution and sex of the individuals are described in the table below:
The exclusion criteria used to exclude subjects were:
• current smoker
• known cardiac condition and/or cardiac disease
• high blood pressure (hypertension)
• kidney disease (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2)
• diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 6.5%)
• active cancer or diagnosis of cancer within the last five years
• previous stroke
• lung disease within the last five years

The specimens were tested with the Alere NT-proBNP for Alinity i assay on the Alinity i system.
Based on the results, the 95% reference interval of an apparently healthy population for each sex
and age range was determined to be as follows:
Reference Interval
Median
Age Range Sex n (2.5th to 97.5th Percentile)
(pg/mL)
(pg/mL)
18 to < 50 years old Female 181 30.7 < 15.8 to 104.8
Male 137 <15.8 < 15.8 to 180.3
