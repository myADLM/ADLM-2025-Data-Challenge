VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study to assess repeatability and within-laboratory precision was conducted
according to CLSI EP05-A3. Five human serum samples and two controls were run in
replicates of two per run, with two runs per day, over 21 days on the cobas c 503 analyzer
using three reagent lots. The three reagent lots performed similarly. Results from a
representative lot are shown below.
Repeatability Within-laboratory precision
Sample Mean Lp(a) (nmol/L)
SD (nmol/L) CV (%) SD (nmol/L) CV (%)
Control 1 35.1 0.368 1.0 0.562 1.6
Control 2 97.8 0.389 0.4 0.997 1.0
Serum 1 19.7 0.414 2.1 0.508 2.6
Serum 2 49.2 0.423 0.9 0.654 1.3
Serum 3 80.7 0.421 0.5 0.727 0.9
Serum 4 120 0.546 0.5 0.981 0.8
Serum 5 204 0.577 0.3 1.11 0.5
An additional precision study was conducted per CLSI EP05-A3 using samples with known
apolipoprotein a (apo(a)) isoform sizes (as determined by SDS agarose gel electrophoresis
and Western blot analysis). Five human serum sample pools were tested in two replicates,
two runs per day for > 21 days on the cobas c 503 analyzer using three lots of reagent.
Results support that precision is not dependent on apo(a) isoform size.
2. Linearity:
Linearity studies
A linearity study was conducted to demonstrate that measurements across the claimed assay
reportable range are linear. The study was conducted according to CLSI EP06 2nd Edition.
Dilution series were prepared from either a human serum sample or a human K EDTA
3
plasma sample containing a high concentration of Lp(a) diluted with 0.9% NaCl to create 15
levels for serum (ranging from ~3 to 263 nmol/L) and plasma (ranging from ~3 to 249
nmol/L). The sets of dilutions were run on one cobas c 503 analyzer in one run using five
replicates per level and three reagent lots for serum samples or one reagent lot for plasma
samples. Linear regression was conducted for each dilution series and the deviation from
linearity was calculated. The linear regression results are shown below.

An additional linearity study was conducted according to CLSI EP06 2nd Edition to assess
linearity in serum samples with known apo(a) isoform sizes. A dilution series was prepared
from a high Lp(a) concentration human serum (with small apo(a) isoform size of 19/20
kringle IV (KIV) repeats) and low Lp(a) concentration human serum (with large apo(a)
isoform size of 35 KIV repeats) to create 15 levels (ranging from ~6 to 252 nmol/L). The
dilution series was run on one cobas c 503 analyzer in one run using four replicates per level
and one reagent lot. The linear regression results support that linearity is not dependent on
apo(a) isoform size.
The linearity studies support the claimed measuring interval of 7 – 240 nmol/L.
Dilution study
A dilution study was conducted to validate the automatic rerun function on the cobas c 503
analyzer. Three native human serum samples with concentrations spanning the extended
measuring interval (based on a validated Lp(a) ELISA assay that measures Lp(a) in nmol/L)
were diluted manually and automatically (via the automatic rerun function) using a 1:3
dilution. Each sample was measured in replicates of three with the Tina-quant Lipoprotein (a)
Gen.2 Molarity assay on the cobas c 503 analyzer. The results support the automatic rerun
function on the cobas c 503 analyzer.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Endogenous interference
An endogenous interference study was conducted to assess whether endogenous substances
interfere with assay results. Two human serum pools with two different Lp(a) concentrations
(low level ranged from 24.9 to 43.6 nmol/L; high level ranged from 77.6 to 123 nmol/L)
were split into two parts with one part spiked with potential interferent (interference pool)
and the other part spiked with solvent (dilution pool). A dilution series of 11 steps was
prepared by mixing the interference pools and related dilution pools. Each dilution step was
measured in 5 replicates according to CLSI EP07 3rd Edition and the mean value was used to
calculate the difference between matched samples with or without interferent. The observed
maximum difference was < ± 4.5 nmol/L for the low level Lp(a) sample and < 7.5% for the
high level Lp(a) sample at the following levels of interferent:
Highest level of substance at which no interference was

Lp(a) concentrations (low level ranged from 38 to 47 nmol/L; high level ranged from 115 to
149 nmol/L) were split into two parts with one part spiked with potential interferent and the
other part spiked with solvent. Each part was measured in 5 replicates and the mean value
was used to calculate the difference between matched samples with or without interferent.
The observed maximum percent difference was < 1.5% at the following levels of interferent:

Cyclosporine 0.2
Ibuprofen 21.9
Theophylline 6
Phenylbutazone 32.1
Cross-reactivity
A cross-reactivity study was conducted to assess whether substances structurally related to
Lp(a) cross-react with the assay. Two human serum pools with two different Lp(a)
concentrations (low level ranged from 41 to 49 nmol/L Lp(a); high level ranged from 112 to
117 nmol/L Lp(a)) were split into two parts with one part spiked with potential cross-reactant
and the other part not spiked with cross reactant. Each part was measured in 5 replicates and
the mean values were used to determine the absolute difference between matched samples
with or without potential cross-reactant. Percent cross reactivity was then calculated using
the following formula: (100 * absolute difference) / cross-reactant concentration. No cross-
reactivity was detected for apolipoprotein B at 223 mg/dL or plasminogen at 160 mg/dL at
either level of Lp(a).
High dose hook effect
A high dose hook effect study was conducted to confirm that no false results will be reported
due to a high dose hook effect. Two native human serum samples containing high
concentrations of Lp(a) were diluted with 0.9% NaCl to create 16 levels. Each level was
measured in triplicate on one cobas c 503 analyzer and three reagent lots of Tina-quant
Lipoprotein (a) Gen.2 Molarity assay. The results support the labeling claim of no false
results up to an Lp(a) concentration of 450 nmol/L.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
The sponsor provided several studies showing associations between Lp(a) and ASCVD risk,
including the UK Biobank study.1
In the UK Biobank study, which included 460,506 participants between the ages of 40 and 69
years, the relationship of Lp(a) concentrations to incident ASCVD was studied. ASCVD was
defined as a composite of coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction and its acute
complications, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or percutaneous angioplasty/stent
placement) and ischemic stroke (cerebral infarction due to thrombosis or cerebral
atherosclerosis or cerebrovascular syndromes).
The event rate per 1000 person-years near 0 nmol/L Lp(a) was ~0.4% and the event rate
increased to ~0.45% at 75 nmol/L Lp(a) and ~0.5% at 125 nmol/L Lp(a) (the claimed
thresholds for this device; see Figure 2A of Patel, et al. 2021). In addition, Cox proportional
hazards regression model (using covariates of enrollment age, sex, race, and Lp(a)
concentration) was performed. This analysis showed an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of ~1.2 at
75 nmol/L Lp(a) and ~1.4 at 125 nmol/L Lp(a) (see Figure 2B of Patel, et al. 2021).
Incidence rates per 1000 person-years were also stratified by racial subgroup (White, Black,
South Asian; see Supplemental Figure V, A of Patel, et al. 2021).
• The event rate per 1000 person-years was ~0.4% for the White group near 0 nmol/L
Lp(a) and increased to ~0.45% at 75 nmol/L Lp(a) and ~0.5% at 125 nmol/L Lp(a).

• The event rate per 1000 person-years was ~0.35% for the Black group near 0 nmol/L
Lp(a), 75 nmol/L Lp(a) and 125 nmol/L Lp(a).
• The event rate per 1000 person-years was ~0.65% for the South Asian group near 0
nmol/L Lp(a) and increased to ~0.75% at 75 nmol/L Lp(a) and 125 nmol/L Lp(a).
The 95% confidence intervals were larger for the Black and South Asian groups. The authors
of the study concluded that there is a linear risk gradient of Lp(a) across different races with
standardized ASCVD risk found to be 11% higher for each increment of 50 nmol/L (HR =
1.11 per 50 nmol/L [95% CI, 1.10-1.12]), independent of adjustment for traditional risk
factors, and with similar effect estimates in all race and ethnicity groups.
Similar associations between Lp(a) and ASCVD risk have also been demonstrated in
multiple published clinical studies in the U.S., including the Dallas Heart Study2. Information
was provided to support that the associations between Lp(a) and ASCVD risk apply to the
candidate assay.
The labeling states the following:
Scientific Statements on Use of Lp(a)
For an individual’s ASCVD risk assessment, according to the American societies (American
Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC)), risk assessment of
ASCVD should begin with a 10-year risk estimation which includes an individual’s age, race and
other established risk factors.3,4 To determine a patient’s overall ASCVD risk, the patient’s
baseline cardiovascular risk and Lp(a)-attributable risk should be considered together.
The Lp(a)-attributable ASCVD risk is independent of a patient’s baseline ASCVD risk, as Lp(a)
can be regarded as a risk enhancer of a patient’s baseline ASCVD risk which is dependent on
several risk factors including family history of premature ASCVD, primary
hypercholesterolemia, metabolic syndrome, sex-specific risk enhancing factors, chronic
inflammatory conditions, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, age, smoking and high-
risk ethnicities.5,6
The National Lipid Association (2024)7 points to the continuous relationship between Lp(a) and
ASCVD risk and provides guidance for a three-tiered risk stratification for Lp(a). The American
College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline on the
Management of Blood Cholesterol (2018) and the ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary
Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (2019) set an Lp(a) threshold of 125 nmol/L above which
individuals are to be considered at increased ASCVD risk.3,4 The table below shows NLA-
recommended Lp(a) thresholds, alongside the Lp(a)-attributable ASCVD risk classification5,8:
Lp(a)-attributable ASCVD risk

These thresholds are aligned with the Lp(a) Consensus Statement by the European
Atherosclerosis Society, which uses UK Biobank data to derive the thresholds. The relationship
of Lp(a) concentrations to incident ASCVD was studied in 460,506 participants between the ages
of 40 and 69 years. ASCVD was defined as a composite of coronary artery disease (myocardial
infarction and its acute complications, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or percutaneous
angioplasty/stent placement) and ischemic stroke (cerebral infarction due to thrombosis or
cerebral atherosclerosis or cerebrovascular syndromes). The data showed a linear risk gradient of
Lp(a) across different races with standardized ASCVD risk found to be 11% higher for each
increment of 50 nmol/L (HR =1.11 per 50 nmol/L [95% CI, 1.10-1.12], independent of
adjustment for traditional risk factors, and with similar effect estimates in all race and ethnicity
groups (which included White, Black, and South Asian groups).1,5
The measured Lp(a) value of a patient’s sample can vary depending on the Lp(a) assay used and
the units reported. The laboratory result report should therefore contain a statement on the Lp(a)
assay used. Values determined in samples by different Lp(a) assays cannot be used
interchangeably.

D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The labeling includes the following Expected values information:
Roche conducted a reference range study and measured Lp(a) levels among various sub-
populations. The expected ranges were determined using samples from apparently healthy adults
in the United States, with an equal representation of males and females. The median age of the
participants was 46 years (IQR 33-57 years).
The values given are for information only and may vary from other published data. The reference
ranges are not intended to be used as medical decision thresholds for cardiovascular risk.
Each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values to its own patient
population and if necessary determine its own reference ranges.
