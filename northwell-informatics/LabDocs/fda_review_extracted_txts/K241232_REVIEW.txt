B Indication(s) for Use:
Galen™ Second Read™ is a software only device intended to analyze scanned histopathology
whole slide images (WSIs) from prostate core needle biopsies (PCNB) prepared from
hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. The device
is intended to identify cases initially diagnosed as benign for further review by a pathologist. If
Galen™ Second Read™ detects tissue morphology suspicious for prostate adenocarcinoma
(AdC), it provides case- and slide-level alerts (flags) which includes a heatmap of tissue areas in
the WSI that is likely to contain cancer.
Galen™ Second Read™ is intended to be used with slide images digitized with Philips Ultra
Fast Scanner and visualized using the Galen™ Second Read™ user interface.
Galen™ Second Read™ outputs are not intended to be used on a standalone basis for diagnosis,
to rule out prostatic AdC or to preclude pathological assessment of WSIs according to the
standard of care.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A. Device Description:
The Galen Second Read (version 3.1-US) uses software algorithms, derived from deterministic
deep convolutional neural networks. It analyzes WSIs of H&E-stained PCNB slides originating
from FFPE tissue sections, that were originally diagnosed as benign by the pathologist. WSIs
that are likely to contain prostatic AdC are flagged by providing heatmap of the relevant tissue
areas for a second read by the pathologist. The final diagnosis is determined by the pathologist
after review of the flagged findings.
The Galen Second Read is cloud-hosted and utilizes scanned WSIs generated from the Philips
Ultra Fast scanner (UFS). For each input WSI, the Galen Second Read automatically analyzes
the WSI and outputs the following:
•Binary classification of the likelihood (high/low) to contain AdC based on a
predetermined threshold of the neural network output.
•For slides classified as high likelihood to contain AdC, slide-level findings are flagged
and visualized (AdC score and heatmap) for additional review by a pathologist.
•For slides classified as low likelihood to contain AdC, no additional output is available.
Galen Second Read key functionalities include image upload and analysis, flagging slides with
high likelihood to contain AdC and displaying WSIs uploaded to the system along with the
analysis results. Flagged findings constitute a recommendation for additional review by a
pathologist.

Figure 1 below presents a high-level view of the Galen Second Read design and workflow.
Figure 1. Galen Second Read High-Level System Design
Galen Second Read is operated as follows:
1. Scanned digital images of PCNB are acquired using the Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution
(PIPS) Ultra Fast Scanner (UFS). Image and other related quality control steps are performed
per the scanner instructions for use and any additional user site specifications.
2. If a case is determined to be benign after initial review by the pathologist, then all WSIs from
the case are uploaded along with its associated metadata (i.e., textual data describing the case
and its WSIs such as Case ID, Slide ID, Tissue and Stain) to the cloud-hosted Galen Second
Read. Once the WSI and its metadata are available, the data is automatically processed
(analyzed) in the background by Galen Second Read.
3. For every slide (WSI), the device provides case- and slide-level alerts (flags). All flagged
findings are available in the Galen Second Read user interface and the pathologist can select a
patient case and open each flagged (pink square) WSI for additional review. The available
information for review includes AdC score (where a higher AdC score indicates a high
suspicion the slide contains AdC) and AdC heatmap marking the tissue region in the WSI that
may contain cancer. The heatmap opacity can be controlled and toggled on/off to allow
unobstructed review of the WSI. When a heatmap is displayed, a legend is shown, indicating
the current active heatmap name and stating the color scale, e.g., blue for low likelihood, red
for high likelihood.
4. After second review of the WSIs, the pathologist can either confirm the device result
(revise the original diagnosis from benign to malignant), reject the device result (no additional
action is required) or decide that more information (e.g., additional stains) is needed before
making a diagnosis.
5. The final determination of diagnosis is made by the pathologist based on the histologic
findings and/or additional tests. Pathologists should follow the standard of care (SoC) to
obtain additional information, as needed, to render a final diagnosis.

B. Algorithm Development
Galen Second Read algorithm development was performed on training, tuning, and test datasets.
Each dataset contained slides from unique patients ensuring that training, tuning, and test
datasets do not have any slides, cases, or patients in common. Slides were labeled by board-
certified pathologists as benign or cancer, including other cell types and structures typically
found in a PCNB, as applicable. Datasets and their characteristics are provided in Table 3 and 4.
These datasets were completely independent from each other and the validation (pivotal clinical
performance studies) datasets.

C. Instrument Description Information:
6. Instrument Name:
Galen Second Read
7. Specimen Identification:
Galen Second Read uses WSIs of H&E-stained glass slides originating from PCNBs obtained
from PIPS UFS to produce a WSI file. The WSI files, and their associated metadata, are
uploaded to the Galen Second Read. When displayed in the user interface, a preliminary view
of the WSI is available in the form of a slide thumbnail showing the image itself next to the
slide ID/barcode as obtained by the scanner.
8. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling and handling are performed prior to and independent of the use of the
Galen Second Read. Specimen sampling includes PCNB specimens which are processed
using histology techniques. The FFPE tissue section is H&E stained. Digital images are then
obtained from these glass slides using the PIPS UFS.
9. Calibration:
Not applicable
10.Quality Control:
Before reading pathology images using the Galen Second Read, pathologists should ensure
that all scanned slide images from all slides from a case have been uploaded. It is the user’s
responsibility to apply appropriate process and quality assurance steps to ensure the quality
of the images obtained and, when necessary, support the diagnosis by use of light
microscopy.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A. Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility
The objective of the studies was to assess the precision (repeatability and reproducibility) of
Galen Second Read in identifying WSI of PCNBs suspicious for cancer, its localization
accuracy and localization precision measured by its sensitivity and specificity. Precision
studies included three separate studies: precision (repeatability and reproducibility) of the
Galen Second Read Prostate slide-level outcome, localization accuracy of the produced
heatmap within the cancer area and localization precision.
Slides used in precision studies were different from the slides used during the development
(algorithm training and testing) of the Galen Second Read. The precision study was
conducted at 4 sites - 2 US sites and 2 OUS sites. De-identified H&E slides were scanned
with a PIPS scanner at 40x magnification. Reported original sign-out diagnosis was used as
ground truth (GT) for the precision study. To evaluate precision at a slide level, unique
consecutive cases diagnosed as cancer or benign originating from PCNBs were enrolled. One
H&E slide from each case was selected by an enroller pathologist to be processed by the
device. Cases diagnosed as prostatic AdC or other cancer and atypical small acinar
proliferation (ASAP) were considered positive. The enroller selected the first slide that was
compatible with the case category. For cancer cases, the first slide reported with the
respective Gleason score identical to the Gleason score assigned to the case was selected.
The study included 39 positive and 38 negative slides. The endpoints for the repeatability and
reproducibility study were defined at the level of slide, as the binary status Positive or
Negative.

Slide-Level Precision Study
i. Repeatability (Within Scanner/Operator): Each slide was evaluated repeatedly 3 times
using a single scanner by the same operator (Scanner 1 acquired by Operator 1). Table 8
presents the agreement rates between device output and ground truth for the three runs
performed by Operator 1. In all three runs, the same 38 out of the 39 positive slides were
correctly identified as true positives (97.4%). Therefore, the overall percent of correct calls
for positive slides across all 3 runs was 97.4%. For negative slides, in the first and third run
the same 33 out of 38 slides were correctly identified as true negatives (86.8%), and in the
second run, 2 additional slides were correctly identified, for a total of 35 out of 38 slides that
were identified as true negatives (92.1%). The overall percent correct calls for negative slides
across all 3 runs was 88.6%.

ii. Reproducibility (Between-Scanner/Operator): Each slide was scanned using 3 different
scanners, where each scanner was operated by a different operator (one operator per
scanner): total 3 repeated assessments (Scanner 1 acquired by Operator 1, Scanner 2 acquired
by Operator 2, Scanner 3 acquired by Operator 3); 39 positive and 38 negative slides = 231
runs.
Table 10 presents the percentages of correct calls by the device vs. ground truth for the three
scanner/operators, along with the overall percent of correct calls across the scanner/operators.
For two scanner/operators, the same 38 out of 39 positive slides (97.4%) were correctly
identified as true positives, and for one scanner/operator, 37 slides were correctly identified
as true positives (94.9%). The overall percent of correct calls for positive slides across all 3
operators was 96.6%. For two scanner/operators, 33 out of 38 negative slides (86.8%) were
correctly identified as true negatives, and for the third scanner/operator, 32 slides were
correctly identified as true negatives (84%). The overall percent of correct calls for negative
slides across all 3 operators was 86.0%.

2. Localization Accuracy Study
Galen Second Read generates the cancer heatmap in a two-step process: First, the tissue
detection model detects the tissue areas in the slide. The model also detects out of focus
(OOF)) areas. A tissue mask is created (without the OOF areas). Second, the classification
algorithm (only on tissue areas) gives each pixel a probability for cancer (between 0 and 1).
To visualize those probabilities, a heatmap is created as shown below in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Cancer Heatmap
The lowest threshold for heatmap is 0.25 (pixel with a lower probability will not be colorized
i.e., will be transparent). The rest of the spectrum (0.25 and above) will have one out of 16
colors from blue (lowest) to red (highest), the thresholds are shown below in Figure 3.
Figure 3. Heatmap Color Spectrum and its Matching Score Thresholds
The goal of the localization accuracy study was to demonstrate that a heatmap (area of
concern) produced by the device is accurate and may provide the pathologist an area of
concern that they can focus on and determine the correct diagnosis.
To evaluate localization accuracy 31 cancer cases and 9 benign cases were selected. All cases
were de-identified, and one slide of each unique case was selected by an enroller pathologist
as the representative slide of the case. For cancer cases, the first slide reported with the
respective Gleason score identical to the Gleason score assigned to the case was selected. For
each slide in the localization and localization precision analysis, one ROI (region of interest)
was chosen. The enroller pathologist selected the ROI, that was defined as one entire biopsy
level, most representative of the slide. In the ROI, the annotating pathologists marked

--- Page 14 ---
polygons (annotations) with a label “cancer” or a label “unsure”. All pixels inside the ROI,
but outside any marked polygon are considered “benign”. GT was established for the pixels
and defined as the majority of diagnoses reported by at least two out of the three pathologists
not participating in the clinical validation studies. The study slides (31 cancer slides and 9
benign slides) were annotated by three pathologists blinded to each other’s
annotation/diagnosis (and to the device results) as follows:
1. Annotate cancer at a whole slide image level selected by the Enroller pathologist (the
selected ROI), representing the whole tissue in the specific level on the slide. The
annotators were instructed to mark "tightly"' the cancer area margins.
2. Annotations must include only cancer foci. All tissue areas inside the ROI, but outside
any marked polygon are considered benign.
The first step (Step#1) in localization accuracy was to demonstrate that the entire area of a
heatmap covers all positive regions. The entire heatmap area (from the warmest up to the
coldest color) can be treated as “rule-out” area. In other words, pixels outside the marked
area can be safely considered as “negative”, and pathologists review can mainly focus on the
heatmap area. Table 12 presents sensitivity and NPV results obtained for Step#1. Note that
each parameter (sensitivity and NPV) was first calculated at the level of slide, and then
summarized over all slides. For that reason, N=31 for sensitivity estimate, and N=40 for NPV
estimate.

Heatmap Area

Sensitivity (%) 98.7 2.2 90.0 99.7 100.0 31

Specificity (%) 91.0 10.1 53.1 94.7 99.7 40
PPV (%) 31.4 27.4 0.0 30.3 87.0 40
The next step (Step#2) was to demonstrate that the warmest sub-area of a heatmap contains
mainly positive pixels. The warmest sub-area can be treated as “rule-in” area. In other words,
pixels within the warmest area should be positive with high probability, and very low
likelihood for False Positive. Table 13 presents specificity and PPV results obtained in the
study for Step#2. Note that each parameter (specificity and PPV) was first calculated at the
level of slide, and then summarized over all slides. For some slides, warmest area was not
produced as part of the heatmap, therefore for PPV estimation N=27.

Step#3 was to demonstrate that all accuracy parameters (sensitivity, specificity, NPV and
PPV) associated with the intermediate areas represented by different colors (from warmest to
coldest) have monotonic pattern, i.e., the change of a color in the heatmap from coldest to
warmest is indicative of decreased likelihood of having FP; and change of a color in the
heatmap from warmest to coldest is indicative of decreased likelihood of having FN. Table
14 presents accuracy parameters for the intermediate heatmap areas. Based on the data, a
monotonic pattern is present for each accuracy parameter indicating that the color breaks of
the heatmap is associated with increased/decreased likelihood of FN and FP.

3. Localization Precision
For localization precision analysis, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were calculated for
each slide and run (defined by a combination of Run / Scanner / Operator). Repeatability and
reproducibility of the localization were assessed via accuracy parameters obtained through
different runs (Run/Scanner/Operator): sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV.
To evaluate localization precision 14 cancer slides and 4 benign slides (18 in total) were
selected from the slides annotated for the localization accuracy study. Each of the 18 slides
was repeatedly scanned, 5 times in total: 3 repeated assessments on Scanner 1 by Operator 1,
one assessment on Scanner 2 by Operator 2 and one assessment on Scanner 3 by Operator 3.
Localization precision was assessed through sensitivity and specificity obtained through
repeated runs for each one of the 16 color-thresholds versus GT, as defined above.
The endpoints for the localization study are defined at the level of pixel within a slide.

The study objective was to assess the performance of the Galen Second Read in identifying
prostatic adenocarcinoma cases (subjects) initially missed by SoC method in PCNBs. This
study was performed with retrospectively collected samples and conducted at three sites:
two sites in the US and one OUS site. Three hundred forty-seven (347) cases were enrolled
in the study. Characteristics of the study cohort are presented in Table 17.
Table 17: Distribution of Cases Characteristics
Number of cases Number of slides Age of subjects (years):
Mean (SD)
Site 1 100 861 66.6 (7.8)
Site 2 99 3686 64.5 (6.4)
Site 3 148 1395 66.8 (8.4)
Combined 347 5942 66.1 (7.7)
The device analyzed scanned WSIs of H&E from 347 cases who were initially diagnosed as
benign based on the PCNBs. The slides were scanned with a Philips UFS scanner at 40x
magnification and WSIs were then processed by Galen Second Read to provide a “Flag”
(Positive) or “No Flag” (Negative). In the study, GT determination for a slide and a case
(subject) was performed as follows: GT determination for a slide was performed by two
independent expert pathologists; for slides where the pathologists disagreed, a third
independent expert pathologist reviewed the slide and the majority rule determined the GT
for the slide. Slides with prostatic AdC or other cancer and ASAP were considered GT
positive slides.
The case was considered as “Flag” by the device if at least one slide from the case has
“Flag” (Positive) and the case is considered as “No Flag” (Negative) by the device if all
slides from the case has “No Flag”.
Out of the total of 347 cases (5,942 slides) that were initially diagnosed as benign, the
device Flagged 202 cases (573 slides) and 145 cases as No Flagged. All slides with Flag by
the device from 202 cases were sent to GT determination. Out of 202 cases, 46 cases were
confirmed as positive GT (ASAP or cancer) after review by expert pathologists.
For estimation of sensitivity and specificity of the device on a slide-level and on a case-
level, the following randomly selected cases were sent to GT determination:
14 cases out of 46 Flagged cases with positive GT determination for the Flagged slides;
46 cases out of 156 Flagged cases with negative GT determination for the Flagged slides;
71 cases out of 145 No Flagged cases.
If the case was selected for GT determination, all slides from the case were sent to GT
determination.
Device performance (sensitivity and specificity) is provided at the level of a slide and at the
level of a case.

For slide-level analysis, the definitions of True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True
Negative (TN), and False Negative (FN) are as follows:
Definition
TP slide Slide is GT positive and Flagged by device
FP slide Slide is GT negative and Flagged by device
FN slide Slide is GT positive and Not Flagged by device
TN slide Slide is GT negative and Not Flagged by device
For case-level analysis, the definitions of TP, FP, TN, and FN are as follows:
Definition
Case has only one GT positive slide and this slide is Flagged by the device
TP case Case has more than one GT positive slide and at least one of these GT positive
slides is Flagged by device
FP case Case has all slides GT Negative and at least one slide is Flagged by the device
FN case Case has one or multiple GT positive slides and all these GT positive slides are
Not Flagged (missed) by the device
TN case Case has all slides GT negative and all slides are not Flagged by the device
After GT determination of the slides for the randomly selected cases (subjects), an
estimation of sensitivity and specificity was adjusted for a verification bias. In addition, two-
sided 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
Slide-Level Performance Results: The analysis included 5,941 slides, of which 2,555 were
verified. Table 18 presents the distribution of the Flag and No Flag slides versus GT status.

were classified as TP. In the verification analysis, 46 randomly selected cases of 156 were
verified for GT. Of these cases, 2 cases were found positive by GT. However, the GT positive
slides were not the same as the slides flagged by the device; these two subjects had both FP, FN
and TN slides. Per the definitions above, these subjects were considered in the analysis as FN.
The unverified 110 cases out of 156 Flagged by the device were considered as “unverified”.
Out of 71 subjects that were not Flagged by the device and sent for verification, 2 cases were
found to be GT positive. Table 20 presents the distribution of the Flag and No Flag cases versus

• The study demonstrated that sensitivity of the Galen Second Read is higher than the
sensitivity of the SoC read (sensitivity of SoC was 0% because all the slides were
diagnosed initially as benign by SoC), both at the slide-level and case-level.
• In the study there was a decrease in specificity of the Galen Second Read compared to the
specificity of SoC (specificity of SoC was 100% because all the slides were diagnosed
initially as benign by SoC). However, this can be managed by mitigation measures such
as use of additional stains to confirm if the slide/case is positive.

lab practice, i.e. on Philips Image Management System and Viewer and associated
computer monitors [PP27QHD (Philips) or MDPC-8127 (Barco NV)].
•Arm B: a Galen Second Read workflow arm, in which after reading slides digitally, the
pathologist reviewed images flagged by the Galen Second Read and determined the final
diagnosis.
All cases and associated slides were read in both Arms of the study (Arm A and Arm B). The
cases were assigned in random order to each of the study pathologists. Each pathologist read all

of their cases/slides, i.e. all the site cases, under both Arms, with a washout period of two weeks
between Arms to minimize recall bias.
To minimize order bias, each pathologist reviewed half of their cases first in Arm A, and
subsequently (after washout period) in Arm B, and the other half first in Arm B, and
subsequently (after washout period) in Arm A. This study design enabled providing a SoC read
and a read using the Galen Prostate workflow by the same pathologist for each slide. During the
second session the pathologists were blinded to their results provided during the first session. For
both arms, the pathologists only reviewed H&E slides and reached a positive or negative
diagnosis. Study pathologists had the option to specify if they would have deferred the diagnosis
to immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains or 2nd opinion for the respective slide.
Ground Truth Pathologists Characteristics: Two (2) pathologists, who were US-board certified
anatomic/surgical pathology and GU sub-specialized, reviewed all the study slides, and
determined each WSI as either positive or negative. The GT pathologists first reviewed only
H&E slides, if requested and available, they were provided with IHCs. Discrepant slides were
reviewed by a third US-board certified anatomic/surgical pathology GU sub-specialized
pathologist.
Accountability: Overall, there were 798 enrolled cases for the study, out of which 26 cases were
fully excluded, because 25 slides was found as out of focus (OOF) / not readable by the
pathologists/GTs or because 1 slide was erroneously read together with corresponding IHC.
Thus, 772 cases/slides were included in both analysis sets: 376 negative cases and 396 positive
cases. In each arm, each case was read 3 times, once per pathologist. Therefore, the total number
of negative reads was anticipated to be 376×3=1128 and the number of positive reads was
anticipated to be 396×3=1188. One negative case in site 3 was out-of-focus for only pathologists
1 (per the pathologist professional opinion), therefore the total number of negative reads was
1127. One positive case in site 3 was erroneously read with IHC staining for pathologist 3,
therefore the total number of positive reads was 1187. Thus, a total of 2314 reads were included
in both analysis sets.
Each pathologist’s result per slide in comparison with the GT (positive or benign) is presented in
Table 24 and Table 25 below.
