C Type of Test:
This assay is a multiplexed nucleic acid test that detects and differentiates SARS-CoV-2, influenza
A, influenza B, and RSV through nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection using real-time
RT-PCR. All steps of the assay are automated, after the manual addition of sample into the sample
lysis tube (SLT) and performed within the Panther and Panther Fusion system.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is a fully automated multiplexed real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test intended for the qualitative detection
and differentiation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A
virus (Flu A), influenza B virus (Flu B), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Nucleic acids are
isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens and anterior nasal (AN) swab
specimens obtained from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of a respiratory tract infection.
Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection due to SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV
can be similar. This assay is intended to aid in the differential diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu
B, and RSV infections in humans and is not intended to detect influenza C virus infections.
Nucleic acids from the viral organisms identified by this test are generally detectable in NP and AN
swab specimens during the acute phase of infection. The detection and identification of specific viral
nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection are
indicative of the presence of the identified virus and aids in diagnosis if used in conjunction with
other clinical and epidemiological information, and laboratory findings. The results of this test should
not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.
Positive results do not rule out coinfection with other organisms. The organism(s) detected by the
Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay may not be the definite cause of disease. Negative
results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, or RSV infections. This
assay is designed for use on the Panther Fusion system.
The Hologic RespDirect Collection Kit is cleared for NP swab specimens only for testing with the
Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is a multiplex real-time reverse
transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test developed for use on the fully automated
Panther Fusion system to detect and differentiate SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and
K241240 - Page 2 of 17

--- Page 3 ---
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) directly from nasopharyngeal or anterior nasal swab specimens.
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay cartridge contains the same sample
preparation and PCR reaction chemistry as the previously cleared Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay
(K171963). To accommodate addition of the SARS-CoV-2 reagents (primers/probes) to the
multiplexed reagents, minor changes were made to the previously cleared analyte primer/probe
concentrations and RFU cutoffs. Additionally, the fluorophore for Flu B was changed from ROX to
RED647 to accommodate the addition of SARS-CoV-2 to the assay.
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay involves the following steps:
a. Sample lysis - Prior to processing and testing on the Panther Fusion system, specimens are
transferred to a Specimen Lysis Tube (SLT) containing specimen transport media (STM).
Alternatively, samples can be collected with the RespDirect Collection kit which
contains enhanced specimen transport media (eSTM). STM and eSTM lyse the cells, release
target nucleic acid and protect them from degradation during storage.
b. Nucleic acid capture and elution - These steps take place in a single tube on the Panther Fusion
system. The eluate is transferred to the Panther Fusion system reaction tube containing the assay
reagents. The Internal Control-S (IC-S) is added to each test specimen and controls via the
working Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). The IC-S in the reagent is used to
monitor specimen processing, amplification, and detection. Magnetic particles with covalently
bound oligonucleotides mediate the nucleic acid capture. Capture oligonucleotides hybridize to
total nucleic acid in the test specimen. Hybridized nucleic acid is then separated from the lysed
specimen in a magnetic field. Wash and aspiration steps remove extraneous components debris
from the reaction tube. The elution step elutes purified nucleic acid.
c. Elution transfer and multiplex RT-PCR - Eluted nucleic acid is transferred to a Panther Fusion
reaction tube already containing oil and reconstituted master mix. A reverse transcriptase
generates a DNA copy of the target sequence. Target specific forward and reverse primers and
probes then amplify targets while simultaneously detecting and discriminating multiple target
types via multiplex RT-PCR. The Panther Fusion system compares the fluorescence signal to a
predetermined cut-off to produce a qualitative result for the presence or absence of the analyte.
The positive result for each analyte will be accompanied by the cycle threshold (Ct value).
Hologic RespDirect Collection Kit
An ancillary collection kit that consists of the RespDirect Swab, intended for collection of NP swab
specimens, and the enhanced Direct Load Tube (eDLT), containing enhanced specimen transport
media (eSTM). This transport media lyses cells, releasing target nucleic acids and protecting them
from degradation during storage.
B Principle of Operation:
The assay detects viral nucleic acids that have been extracted from a patient respiratory sample (i.e.,
NPS or ANS swab). A multiplex Real-time RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized
conditions generating amplicons for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. The Internal
Control-S (IC-S) is added to each test specimen before processing to act as a control for specimen
processing, amplification, and detection. Identification of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B,
RSV, and the IC-S occurs using target-specific primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that hybridize
to conserved regions in the viral genomes (Table 1).

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
Since the initial clearance of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV Assay (K222736), an
Adaptive Crosstalk Correction (ACC) factor was implemented in the Assay Definition Module
(ADM) software to eliminate potential under correction of crosstalk between the SARS-CoV-2
(ROX channel) and the Flu B channel (RED674) that in some cases produced false Flu B positive
results for samples that were also SARS-CoV-2 high positives. The ACC was evaluated by (1)
reanalyzing all analytical and clinical study data collected in support of K222736 with the ACC,
except for the Cutoff Study1, and (2) Performing additional analytical and clinical studies with the
ACC to demonstrate that the software changes are effective in eliminating the infrequent occurrence
of false Flu B results in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples.
For those studies originally performed in K222736 and reanalyzed with the new ACC, there were no
changes to the study conclusions using the original acceptance criteria. The results of additional
analytical studies and clinical studies to support the ACC are presented below. Since there were no
other modifications to the assay (e.g., test reagent formulation, etc.), it was unnecessary to repeat
several of the studies performed in support of K222736. If a study was not repeated, a reference to
where the results can be found (i.e., publicly available K222736 Decision Summary) has been made.
1Data produced in the Cutoff Study were generated with single target panels/samples which are not affected by
Adaptive Crosstalk Correction since cross talk only impacts results where SARS-CoV-2 and Flu B are present.
Since the Cutoff Study data did not contain that condition, re-analysis was not performed.

Competitive Interference Study Performed with the Adaptive Crosstalk Correction
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the Adaptive Crosstalk Correction does not
cause competitive interference in co-infected samples containing high levels of SARS-CoV-2 and
low levels of Flu B. One SARS-CoV-2 strain (USA-WA1/2020, BEI NR-52281) and one Flu B
strain (Victoria lineage, Washington/02/19, Zeptometrix PN:0810611CF ) were included in the
evaluation. Co-infection panels were made by spiking SARS-CoV-2 at a high concentration
(10,000 TCID /mL) and Flu B at a low concentration (~3x LoD) in pooled negative NP swab

VTM/UTM clinical matrix. Three replicates were tested with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-
2/Flu A/B/RSV Assay utilizing the ACC ADM. The results of the competitive interference study
are shown in Table 2. No competitive interference was observed at the concentrations tested.

one (1) Yamagata lineage and one (1) Victoria lineage (Table 3). These are the same strains used
to establish the Flu B LoD in K222736. Samples were prepared in pooled negative NP swab
VTM/UTM clinical matrix at 1x LoD, as established in K222736. Additionally, dilutions half a
log above and below the established LoD were tested to confirm the LoD. Twenty-eight
replicates were collected for each strain/concentration combination included in the study. The
LoDs of both Flu B strains were confirmed to be the same as previously established in K222736
before the ACC was implemented. The LoD results are summarized in Table 3.

Prospective Study to Expand the Intended Use to Include an ANS Specimen Claim
The clinical performance of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was
established in a multi-center study conducted with two patient-matched ANS specimens that
were prospectively collected (i.e., all comers between two time points who meet the inclusion
criteria) from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infections during the
2022-2023 respiratory illness season. ANS specimens from nine geographically diverse clinical
sites in the U.S. were enrolled and tested fresh (Category I specimens) with the Panther Fusion
SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay at three U.S. testing sites.
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2
performance by comparing the candidate device testing results to a composite comparator
algorithm (CCA) consisting of three highly sensitive U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2 molecular
tests. A final CCA result was assigned when two of the three composite comparator assays were
in concordance. The comparator method utilized to establish performance for the Flu A, Flu B,
and RSV targets was a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular Flu A/B/RSV assay. All comparator testing
was performed in accordance with the respective package inserts at one central laboratory.
A total of 1268 subjects (each providing two ANS specimens) were acquired and enrolled for the
prospective clinical study. Of these 1268 subjects, two were withdrawn because they did not
meet the study eligibility criteria, leaving 1266 subjects. Of these 1266 subjects, 77 had their
ANS specimens excluded because they were received outside the candidate assay sample
stability period, did not have a valid SARS-CoV-2 CCA or Flu A/Flu B/RSV comparator result,
or had an invalid candidate device result upon retesting per the Instructions for Use. This left
1189 ANS specimens with evaluable results for SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV.
Of the 1268 subjects enrolled in the study, 1230 had their ANS specimens tested with the
candidate device. Ten (10) of these specimens were invalid by the candidate device during
testing, for an initial invalid rate of 0.8% (10/1230). Upon retesting, the invalid rate decreased to
0.3% (4/1230).
Table 4 provides a summary of demographic information for the 1189 evaluable specimens
included in the prospective clinical study.

A summary of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay prospective clinical study
performance is provided in Table 5.
Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was calculated as 100% × (TP / (TP + FN)). True positive
(TP) indicates that both the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay and the comparator
method had a positive result for the specific analyte, and false negative (FN) indicates that the
Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV was negative while the comparator result was
positive. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was calculated as 100% × (TN / (TN + FP)). True
negative (TN) indicates that both the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay and the
comparator method had negative results, and false positive (FP) indicates that the Panther Fusion
SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was positive while the comparator result was negative.
Specimens that obtained discordant results underwent additional testing with a U.S. FDA EUA
SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular test, when sufficient sample volume remained.

Retrospective Clinical Study with ANS Specimens
Flu B and RSV were of lower prevalence and were not encountered in sufficiently large numbers
during the prospective clinical study to adequately demonstrate assay performance with ANS
specimens. To supplement the results of the prospective clinical study, an evaluation of 175 pre-
selected, archived retrospective specimens was performed. These specimens were archived ANS
in VTM or UTM that were collected between November 2022 and June 2023. Specimens were
selected for enrollment in the study based solely on the historic qualitative result. In addition to
evaluating Flu B and RSV positive specimens, Flu A positive specimens were included in the
study. Of the 175 specimens, 2 were not included in performance calculations because they had
invalid comparator results, leaving 173 specimens. The 173 remaining specimens were

Retrospective Clinical Study Conducted with SARS-CoV-2 Positive Clinical Specimens to
Evaluate the Adaptive Crosstalk Correction
To demonstrate that the Adaptive Crosstalk Correction can resolve unexpected Flu B positives in
the presence of SARS-CoV-2, ten individual SARS-CoV-2 high positive archived NP swab
clinical specimens (in VTM/UTM) were evaluated with the original ADF (K222736) and the
modified ADF containing the ACC. Each specimen was tested once with each ADF. The results
are summarized in Table 11. All ten specimens produced Flu B positive results when tested with
the original ADF (without the ACC). Upon testing with the new ADF containing the ACC, all
Flu B positive results were resolved (i.e., all specimens yielded Flu B negative results),
demonstrating that the ACC is functioning as intended.

*SARS-CoV-2 positive NPS specimens had high titers (i.e., Ct values ranging
from 13.5 - 27.2 per the assay without the ACC). These specimens were reflective of those that
yielded false Flu B positive results in the field.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay prospective clinical study included a total of
1268 prospectively collected ANS specimens, of which 1189 were evaluable for SARS-CoV-2, Flu
A, Flu B, and RSV. The number and percentage of cases positive for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A,
influenza B, and RSV, as determined by the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay, are
presented below, stratified by collection site.
