FullFocus is a software intended for viewing and management of digital images of scanned
surgical pathology slides prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. It is an
aid to the pathologist to review, interpret and manage digital images of pathology slides for
primary diagnosis. FullFocus is not intended for use with frozen sections, cytology, or non-FFPE
hematopathology specimens.
It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate procedures and safeguards
to assure the quality of the images obtained and, where necessary, use conventional light
microscopy review when making a diagnostic decision. FullFocus is intended to be used with the
interoperable components specified in the below Table.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
FullFocus, version 2.29, is a web-based software-only device that facilitates the viewing and
navigating of digitized pathology images of slides prepared from FFPE tissue specimens
acquired from FDA cleared digital pathology scanners on FDA cleared displays as specified in
the intended use Table above. FullFocus renders these digitized pathology images for review,
management, and navigation for pathology primary diagnosis.
Image acquisition is performed using the intended scanner(s), with the operator conducting
quality control on the whole-slide images according to the scanner's instructions for use and lab
specifications to determine if re-scans are needed.
Once a whole slide image is acquired using the intended scanner and becomes available in the
scanner's database file system, a separate medical image communications software (not part of
the device) automatically uploads the image and its corresponding metadata to persistent cloud
storage. Integrity checks are performed during the upload to ensure data accuracy.
The WSIs undergo intentional compression and are converted into standardized Paige TIFF files
when visualized in FullFocus, as shown in Table below. Testing was conducted to ensure that the
compressed images maintain fidelity to their original images.

FullFocus
2. Specimen Identification:
The FullFocus device utilizes digital pathology images acquired from Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) stained glass slides using the Leica Aperio GT 450 DX scanner or the
Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner. A reading pathologist selects a case
(patient) from an external worklist, and the subject device retrieves the corresponding images
from external image storage. The scanned images are identified using the specimen identifier
previously assigned to the case.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling and handling are conducted independently and prior to the use of the
subject device. This process involves obtaining biopsy or resection specimens, which are

5. Quality Control:
The subject device receives whole-slide images from the Paige image storage system. All
WSI files are quality-controlled and acquired in accordance with the scanner’s instructions
for use. The subject device incorporates specific quality control measures to ensure the
accuracy and completeness of the images. Each pathologist must perform quality checks
prior to analyzing pathology images using the subject device. This includes verifying that all
scanned slide images have been successfully imported. For each case, the pathologist should
review the thumbnails in the pathology image window to confirm that all required slides are
present. Additionally, the tissue block and staining information should be manually verified
against data from the Laboratory Information System (LIS).

Technical performance testing was conducted with the subject device, FullFocus as specified
below.
1. Bench Testing - Pixelwise comparison test
FullFocus supports multiple file formats, multiple browsers, and multiple displays,
constituting various configurations to be tested. Pixel-wise comparison testing to demonstrate
identical image reproduction was conducted to compare WSIs reproduced by the subject
device and the comparators as listed in Table 3 below. The subject device was compared to
the predicate device’s image review manipulation software (IRMS, as defined in FDA
K241273 - Page 7 of 10

--- Page 8 ---
guidance document, “Technical Performance Assessment of Digital Pathology Whole Slide
Imaging Devices” dated April 20, 2016) using the quantitative pixel-wise comparison
method. The basis for the comparison was the CIEDE2000 color difference equation, ΔE00.
The devices were tested as operating with the intended components, including the scanner,
specific file format, image management systems (subject device with the intended browsers,
comparator [predicate device IRMS]) and displays, as specified in the Table 3 below.
For each of the 6 configurations in Table 3 below, the device was tested with multiple slides
across multiple regions of interest (ROI) at multiple magnification levels, on multiple
displays. A total of 30 H&E-stained, FFPE glass slides of normal and tumor tissues from
various human anatomical organs were used in the testing. For each configuration, the glass
slides were scanned on a corresponding intended scanner to obtain 30 WSIs. For each of the
30 WSIs, 3 ROIs from different locations were selected by qualified personnel to represent
various features in the tissue samples. Each ROI was captured at 2 magnification levels (10x,
40x).
The screenshots were captured for each of the intended display while viewing with the
subject device and predicate device IRMS. The screenshots were cropped and registered to
be pixelwise comparable. The cropped image included most of the pixels in the image except
for those in the viewer-specific user interface areas.
For each configuration and each intended display, two sets of images were collected:
comparator (predicate device IRMS) and the subject device (FullFocus with the intended
browser). Each image set included 180 images that covered all combinations of 30 slides, 3
ROIs and 2 magnification levels. The testing data, including the overview images of the 30
glass slides with annotations of the ROIs, registration/cropping information, and captured
images, were provided in the FDA specific format. The above procedure was repeated for
each corresponding intended display.
The comparator (predicate device IRMS) image set was used as the reference to compare the
subject device image set to determine whether all the 180 image-pairs were identical for each
configuration and each intended display. Two images are considered identical if the 95th
percentile of the pixelwise differences, computed using the International Commission on
Illumination (CIE) color difference metric CIEDE2000 (ΔE00), is less than 3 ΔE00. Testing
results showed that the pixelwise differences across all 180 image-pairs per configuration and
per intended display were less than 3 ΔE00. The maximum (max), minimum (min), and mean
of the 95th percentile ΔE00 value were reported in Table 3. Testing results demonstrated that
WSIs reproduced by FullFocus are identical to images reproduced by the predicate devices.

3. Measurement – distance and area
The length and area measurement accuracy of the subject device was tested across multiple
magnification levels. An image of a calibration scale slide with known object sizes was used
to verify the measurement accuracy. A series of annotations were created to cover different
orientations and different magnification levels in 4 intended browsers. The differences
between the actual and reported measurements were calculated for each annotation. The
acceptance criteria were as follows: 1) The 1 mm measured line should match the reference

value exactly 1 mm ± 0mm and 2). The measured area must match the reference area exactly
0.2 x 0.2 mm for a total of 0.04 mm2 ± 0 mm2. Test results showed that the subject device
performed accurate measurements of length and area and all line and area measurements
compared to the reference value were exactly the same with no error, across multiple
magnification settings with respect to its intended use.
