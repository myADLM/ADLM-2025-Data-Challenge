II Review Summary:
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the submitter's own
CLASS II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable.
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER'S previously cleared device: Jazz Blood
Glucose Monitoring System, K072413.
2. Submitter's statement that the INDICATIONS FOR USE/INTENDED USE of the
modified device as described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed
labeling which includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available,
advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do
not affect the intended use).
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams,
engineering drawings, photographs, user's and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to
demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified
device has not changed. This change was for:

- Add target range indicator colors to the meter top housing.
- Software change: add target range indicator to indicate to the user whether a
measurement is below, within or above the user-set target glucose ranges.
- LCD modification to adjust style and location of information on the display.
- The device labeling is updated accordingly to reflect the modifications and
disinfection instructions are added.
4. Comparison Information (i.e., similarities and differences) to the submitter's legally marketed
predicate device including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics.
5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification
on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation
activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter's description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information
between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific
technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as
specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined
substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
The device system is intended for single patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the exterior meter materials demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B
virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant Super Sani-Cloth Germicidal Disposable Wipe (EPA
Reg. No.: 9480-4). A robustness study was also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that
there was no change in performance or in external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and
disinfection cycles to support 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
