See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test is an OTC in vitro diagnostic test used to assess early
pregnancy by detecting the presence of the hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) hormone in
urine. The test device is intended for use as an aid in early detection of pregnancy, in some cases
as early as six (6) days before the day of the missed period, i.e., as early as five (5) days before
the day of the expected period.
The iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test Strip is an OTC in vitro diagnostic test used to assess early
pregnancy by detecting the presence of the hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) hormone in
urine. The test device is intended for use as an aid in early detection of pregnancy, in some cases
as early as six (6) days before the day of the missed period, i.e., as early as five (5) days before
the day of the expected period.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The tests are available in two formats: 1) The iHealth Early Pregnancy Test, which consists of a
single test strip assembled in a plastic card, with an absorbent tip, designed to be tested in dip or
midstream sampling mode; and 2) the iHealth Early Pregnancy Test Strip which consists of a
single test strip, designed to be used by dipping the strip into a urine sample collected into the
provided collection cup.
B Principle of Operation:
The tests are lateral flow immunoassays for the in vitro detection of human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. Testing is conducted by immersing the absorbent tip in urine (dip
mode) for 10 seconds or urinating on the absorbent tip (midstream mode) for 2-3 seconds and
obtaining the result from the colored lines. After application of the urine specimen, the test result
is shown in the result window and read visually after 3-5 minutes of urine application. The hCG
present in the urine sample, it is bound by an hCG-2 antibody colloidal gold conjugate present at
the front of the test strip forming a complex. This conjugate complex is captured by hCG-1
antibody in the detection zone forming a colored line in the test line region. Concurrently, a line
will appear in the quality control zone. If the sample is negative, meaning it lacks hCG or the
hCG concentration is below the detection limit, only a line appears in the quality control area.
The test result is shown in the result window and read visually 3-5 minutes after urine
application. Two distinct colored lines, one line in the control line region and another in the test
K241394 - Page 2 of 11

line region, indicate a positive test result (pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the test line
region and only a colored line in the control line region indicates a negative test result (not
pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the control line region, even in the presence of a colored
line in the test line region, indicates an invalid test result.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using negative female urine samples spiked with hCG
(traceable to the 5th World Health Organization International Standard (WHO IS)) to obtain
samples with hCG concentrations of 0, 3, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15 and 25 mIU/mL. Each sample
was tested using three lots of iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test Strip using dip sampling mode
and the iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test using both dip and midstream sampling modes. The
tests were performed over the course of five non-consecutive days, at three sites, by nine
different operators. A total of 405 replicates were performed per sampling mode per hCG
concentration. The results are summarized in the tables below:

Cross-reactivity of structurally-related compounds
A study was performed to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity from luteinizing hormone
(LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) on the
iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test and the iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test Strip devices.
Negative, female, human urine sample were used to make samples containing 0 and 10
mIU/mL hCG, which were then spiked with the potential cross-reactants: 500 mIU/mL LH,
1000 mIU/mL FSH, and 1 mIU/mL TSH. Samples were tested in replicates of five with each
of three lots of the candidate devices. The results demonstrated no cross-reactivity from
potential cross-reactants was observed at the tested concentrations.
Effect of urine pH
A study was performed to evaluate the effects of urine pH on the iHealth® Early Pregnancy
Test and the iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test Strip devices. Negative, female, human urine
sample were used to make samples containing 0 and 10 mIU/mL hCG, which were then
adjusted to pH values from 4.0 to 9.0 and tested using the candidate devices. Samples were
tested in replicates of five, using three lots of the candidate devices. The results demonstrated
that samples within the pH range of 4.0 to 9.0 do not interfere with either positive or negative
results from the device.
Effect of urine Specific Gravity
A study was performed to evaluate the effects of urine specific gravity on the iHealth® Early
Pregnancy Test and the iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test Strip devices. Negative, female,
human urine sample were used to make samples containing 0 and 10 mIU/mL hCG, which
were then adjusted to specific gravity values from 1.000 to 1.035 and tested using the
candidate devices. Samples were tested in replicates of five, using three lots of the candidate
device. The results demonstrated that samples within the specific gravity range of 1.000 to
1.035 do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the device.
Effect of hCG β-core (hCGβcf) fragment
A study was performed to evaluate the effects hCGβcf on the iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test
and the iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test Strip devices. Negative, female, human urine samples
and were used to make samples containing 0 and 10 mIU/mL hCG, which were then spiked
with hCG β-core fragment concentrations of 250,000 pmol/L, 500,000 pmol/L, and
1,000,000 pmol/L. Samples were tested in replicates of five, using three lots of the candidate

concentrations of hCGβcf up to 1,000,000 pmol/L.
High dose hook effect study
A study was performed to evaluate the high dose hook effect on the iHealth® Early
Pregnancy Test and the iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test Strip devices. Negative, female,
human urine samples were spiked up to 1,000,000 mIU/mL hCG and tested using the
candidate device. Samples were tested in replicates of five, using three lots of the candidate
device. No hook effect was observed at concentrations of up to 1,000,000 mIU/mL hCG.

A total of 204 urine samples were collected from women whose ages ranged from 18 to 45
years, who suspect they are in the early stages of pregnancy. Approximately half of the
women were suspected to be pregnant and most of them were in the early stage of pregnancy
(less than 5 weeks). The samples were masked and randomized prior to testing by
professionals using the candidate device (iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test in dip mode and
midstream mode and iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test Strip in dip mode) and the predicate
device (Clearblue Early Pregnancy Test in dip mode). One hundred and three (103) samples
were tested using the iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test Strip and 101 samples were tested using
the iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test Stick. Summary results are presented in the tables below.

iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test Strip and 101 lay users using the iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test.
Lay users tested their own urine specimen. Each lay user also provided a sample for professional
testing. Then the results of lay-user tests were compared to results reported by a laboratory
professional. The data shows that the agreement between lay-user results and professional results

Specificity Study to Determine False Positive Result Rate
A study was performed to determine the incidence of false positive test results from iHealth®
Early Pregnancy Test and iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test Strip. Urine samples were collected
from 300 women from each of three cohorts: non-pregnant pre-menopausal women aged 18-40
years, non-pregnant peri-menopausal women aged 41-55 years, and non-pregnant post-
menopausal women > 55 years of age. Samples were tested by trained technicians with three lots
of the candidate device using both the iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test (dip mode) and the
iHealth® Early Pregnancy Test Stick (dip mode and midstream mode). No false positive results
were observed for any of the age groups. Results of the study are shown in the table below:
