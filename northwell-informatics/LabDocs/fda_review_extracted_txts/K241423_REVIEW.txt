III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Access Thyroglobulin assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of thyroglobulin levels in human serum and plasma using the Access
Immunoassay Systems. This device is intended to aid in monitoring for the presence of persistent
or recurrent/metastatic disease in patients who have differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and
have had thyroid surgery (with or without ablative therapy), and who lack serum thyroglobulin
antibodies.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
The Instructions for Use of the device contains the following warning statement:
“The presence of serum autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (TgAb) can interfere with assays for
thyroglobulin (Tg). Therefore, sera which contain TgAb, even at very low levels, should not be
tested for Tg.
The concentration of thyroglobulin in a given specimen determined with assays from different
manufacturers can vary due to differences in assay methods and reagent specificity. The results
reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the Tg assay used. Values
obtained with different assay methods cannot be used interchangeably. If, in the course of
monitoring a patient, the assay method used for determining Tg levels serially is changed,
additional sequential testing should be carried out to confirm baseline values.”
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Access Immunoassay Systems (Access Immunoassay System and Access 2 Immunoassay
System)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Access Thyroglobulin assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
quantitative determination of thyroglobulin levels in human serum and plasma (heparinized)
using the Access Immunoassay Systems.

Materials included in the Access Thyroglobulin assay
Reagent Pack (2 packs, 50 tests/pack) contains:
• R1a (3.25 mL): Dynabeads paramagnetic particles coated with streptavidin and coupled
to biotinylated mouse monoclonal antithyroglobulin antibodies in TRIS
buffer with protein (bovine) and preservatives
• R1b (3.10 mL): Mouse monoclonal anti-thyroglobulin-alkaline phosphatase (bovine)
conjugate in a TRIS buffer with protein (bovine, murine) and
preservatives
• R1c (3.10 mL): HEPES buffer with protein (bovine, murine) and preservatives
Materials needed but not supplied
• Access Thyroglobulin Calibrators: Six levels – 0, 1.0, 10, 100, 250, and 500 ng/mL
• Quality control materials: commercial control material
• Access Thyroglobulin Sample Diluent
• Access Substrate
• Access Wash Buffer II / Unicel DxI Wash Buffer II
B Principle of Operation:
The Access Thyroglobulin assay is a simultaneous one-step immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”)
assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel with four biotinylated anti-thyroglobulin antibodies
coated on streptavidin paramagnetic particles, and monoclonal anti-thyroglobulin antibody
alkaline phosphatase conjugate. The thyroglobulin in the sample binds to the biotinylated
antibodies on the solid phase, while the conjugate antibody reacts with a different antigenic site
on the thyroglobulin molecule. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid
phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured
with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of
thyroglobulin in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored,
multi-point calibration curve.
