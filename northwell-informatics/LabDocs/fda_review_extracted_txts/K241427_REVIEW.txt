B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access Syphilis assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
qualitative detection of total antibodies to Treponema pallidum in human serum and plasma
using the Access Immunoassay Systems. It is intended to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of
syphilis or in conjunction with a non-treponemal laboratory test and clinical findings to aid in the
diagnosis of syphilis infection. The Access Syphilis assay is not intended for blood and tissue
donor screening.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Access Immunoassay Systems
• Access 2 Immunoassay System
• DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Access Syphilis assay is a two-step enzyme chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay.
The test is performed by adding a sample to the reaction vessel, along with buffer, paramagnetic
particles coated with recombinant Treponema pallidum antigens Tp17 and Tp47, and
biotinylated Treponema Tp17 and Tp47 antigens. The sample mixture is incubated in the
reaction vessel, allowing materials to bind to the solid phase where they are held in a magnetic
field. Any unbound materials are washed away.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access Syphilis assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the
qualitative detection of total antibodies to Treponema pallidum in human serum and plasma
using the Access Immunoassay Systems. The Access Immunoassay System is fully automated to
allow assay-specific reagents to form immune complexes, immobilize the bound immune
complex by magnetic field, and allow the unbound components to be washed away.
The Access Syphilis assay uses the following reagents:
• Treponema pallidum antigens labeled with alkaline phosphatase
• Antigen-coated micron-sized paramagnetic particles
• TRIS-buffered saline with biotinylated Tp17 and Tp47 conjugates
The assay is a two-step immunoenzymic “sandwich” assay. The sample is added to the reaction
vessel along with buffer, recombinant Tp17- and Tp47-coated paramagnetic particles, and
biotinylated Treponema Tp17 and Tp47 antigens. The mixture is incubated to allow Treponemal
antibodies that may be present to be captured by the antigens. Following incubation, any
unbound materials are washed away, and the materials bound to the solid phase are held in a
magnetic field. Alkaline phosphatase conjugates are added that bind to immunoglobulin captured
on the particles. A chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the
reaction is measured with a luminometer. The measured light allows for determination of the
K241427 - Page 2 of 18

presence of the analyte by comparison with a cut-off value defined during the assay calibration
on the instrument.
Test results are determined automatically by the system software. Results expressed as
Signal/Cutoff (S/CO) are reported to be “reactive” or “nonreactive” as a function of their
relationship with the “cut-off”.
The result interpretation for the Access Syphilis assay is as follows:
S/CO < 1.00 Nonreactive
S/CO ≥ 1.00 Reactive
Interpretation of results:
Reactive: Treponemal antibodies detected; indicates active or previous infection with Treponema
pallidum.
Nonreactive: Treponemal antibodies not detected; indicates no active or previous infection with
Treponema pallidum.
Test results are intended to aid in diagnosis only. As with all serological tests for syphilis, results
should always be interpreted in conjunction with additional treponemal or nontreponemal
serologic test results (as appropriate), the patient’s clinical symptoms, medical history, and other
clinical and/or laboratory findings to produce a diagnosis of syphilis by disease stage.
Access Syphilis Calibrator
Intended for the calibration of the Access Syphilis assay. Provided as one negative and one
positive calibrator for Treponemal pallidum antibody.
Access Syphilis Controls
Intended for the estimation of test precision and the detection of systematic analytical deviations
of the Access Immunoassay System when used for the qualitative detection of antibodies to
Treponemal pallidum (TP) in human serum and plasma. Provided as three vials each of
Treponema pallidum antibody positive control and Treponema pallidum negative control.

Multi-site Reproducibility
A multicenter reproducibility study was performed at three clinical sites using three lots each
of the Access Syphilis assay, three lots of calibrators, and three lots of controls. Each panel
consisted of one low negative, one high negative, one low positive, and one positive, as well
as two assay controls. Panel members were tested using four replicates per run, two runs per
day, for a total of five days to generate 120 data points at each site per platform. Data was
analyzed for intra-assay and inter-assay reproducibility.

Interference by Endogenous Substances
Potential interference with hemoglobin, bilirubin, triolein, protein (albumin), and gamma
globulin were evaluated in an analytical study by preparing the panel members at treponemal
concentrations targeted at the levels described in the table below.
Table 6. Interference panel members

Each of the four panel members was split into seven aliquots (for each of the six conditions
plus a control). Each aliquot was spiked directly with the substance at the target final
concentration. If an effect was observed at a given analyte concentration, a dose effect study
was performed to determine the minimum interfering concentration.

Interference was observed with the Access Syphilis test in the presence of gamma globulin at
a concentration of 60 mg/mL in negative and positive specimens. The highest concentration
for which no interference was observed across three lots of the Access Syphilis assay was
47.5 mg/mL. No interference was observed for the other listed substances up to the levels
indicated in the table above.
Drug Interference
Potential interference due to the presence of common pharmaceutical compounds was tested
in a drug interference study. Panels were prepared as described for the endogenous
interference study. Each panel member was divided into ten aliquots (for seven exogenous
substances and three control conditions). The aliquots were spiked directly with the drug of
interest at the final target concentration listed in the table below. For the control specimens,
the same amount of drug diluent (deionized water or ethanol) was spiked-in to avoid bias
between test and control specimens. No interference was observed at the levels tested.

• Freeze/thaw stability for 0 - 6 cycles (at -20 and -80˚C)
Each sample was tested in duplicate with the Access 2 and DxI 9000 instruments at each time
point. The evaluation of results was performed separately for each concentration, storage
condition, and time point.
The mean S/CO was calculated for each subsequent time point for each panel member,
concentration level, storage condition, and tube type. The difference between the mean S/CO
at each time point and the corresponding baseline mean S/CO, taken at day zero, was
calculated. For negative panel members (S/CO < 1.00), the difference in measured
concentration was within ± 0.10 compared to the baseline and the negative agreement was
100% among the different time points. For positive panel members (S/CO ≥ 1.00), the
median S/CO percentage bias was within ± 15% versus the baseline and the positive
agreement was at least 95% for the low positive specimens (< 2.5x S/CO) and 100% for the
positive specimens (≥ 2.5x S/CO).
The study data supported the following storage conditions:
• 2 to 8°C for 7 days
• 20 to 25°C for 72 hours
• -20°C or colder for 30 days
• Samples may be frozen and thawed up to 5 times.
Reagent Stability
To test reagent stability, three lots of Access Syphilis reagent packs were tested in triplicate
within a month after production. After the initial time point, testing was conducted in duplicate at
3, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 months approximately for each lot, with additional testing for lots one and
two at 13 months and testing for lot one through 15 months. The positive calibrator and negative
calibrators were tested at each time point to validate the run and calibrate the reagent pack stored
at 2-10°C. Four panel members plus a positive and negative control were used to assess real-time
reagent stability. The study data from three lots supported stability up to 10.9 months when
stored at 2-10°C unopened.
On-board Reagent Stability
To assess the on-board reagent stability of Access Syphilis, ten open kits were tested multiple
times between day 0 and day 62. The positive calibrator and negative calibrators were tested at
each time point to validate the run and calibrate the reagent pack stored at 2-10°C. Four panel
members plus a positive and negative controls were used to assess real-time reagent stability.
The study data supported stability up to 56 days after opening when stored at 2-10°C.
Hook Effect
The sponsor conducted a study to demonstrate that the Access Syphilis assay does not produce
false non-reactive results when testing samples with high levels of anti-TP antibody. The study
utilized five CPD plasma specimens with medium to high levels of anti-TP antibody which were
serially diluted with negative serum. Each of the diluted specimens was tested with the Access
Syphilis assay. The data from this study showed that there was no high dose hook effect,
K241427 - Page 12 of 18

--- Page 13 ---
suggesting that the Access Syphilis assay is not susceptible to interference from specimens with
high levels of anti-syphilis TP antibodies.
6. Detection Limit:
Not applicable.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The Access Syphilis cut-off was evaluated by ROC analysis using 301 antibody-positive and
3047 negative specimens. Specimens were tested in one replicate on the DxI 9000 and
Access 2 instruments.
To determine the cut-off value, a normalized ratio was determined for each specimen by
dividing the specimen signal by the signal obtained with the positive calibrator tested in
triplicate during the same testing runs. The normalized ratio values were used to build the
ROC curve, and the optimal normalized ratio value that gave the best compromise between
sensitivity and specificity was determined.
Result classification:
S/CO < 1.00 sample is interpreted as “non-reactive”
S/CO ≥ 1.00 sample is interpreted as “reactive”
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
See the “Clinical Studies” section.
2. Matrix Comparison:
The suitability of various blood collection tube types for use with the Access Syphilis assay
was evaluated in an analytical study. Samples were obtained from multiple donors and
venous blood was collected in the following tube types:
• Serum (collected in dry tube) – used as the control
• Serum separator tubes
• Citrate phosphate dextrose with adenine (CPDA)
• Lithium heparin
• Lithium heparin with gel separator tube
• Dipotassium (K2) EDTA
• Tripotassium (K3) EDTA
• Sodium citrate
• Citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD)
• Acid citrate dextrose (ACD)
A total of 65 paired specimens, 25 non-reactive and 40 reactive, were tested for each matrix.
Positive specimens were prepared by spiking negative specimens with highly reactive
syphilis samples to targeted concentrations. A total of four levels of reactivity were
evaluated:

*About half of the samples were prepared in the 1.00 – 1.50 S/CO range.
Each sample was tested in duplicate. Percent agreement and bias analysis were calculated in
comparison to the control condition (serum collected in a dry tube).
The resulting data demonstrates that serum, serum with gel separator, lithium heparin,
lithium heparin with gel separator, dipotassium EDTA, tripotassium EDTA, sodium citrate,
citrate phosphate dextrose, acid citrate dextrose, and citrate phosphate dextrose with adenine
tubes are acceptable for use with the Access Syphilis assay.
C Clinical Studies:
A multicenter study was conducted on the Access 2 and DxI 9000 instruments between June and
September 2023 to evaluate the ability of the Access Syphilis assay to detect antibodies directed
against Treponema pallidum (TP). A total of 1923 specimens were tested in the Access Syphilis
clinical study on both the Access 2 and the DxI 9000 instruments. Of these 1923, 13 were
excluded from analysis. The remaining 1910 included 1104 prospectively collected from the
intended use population; 50 retrospective samples from a population at high-risk for STIs; 402
retrospective specimens including 22 pregnant women; 204 apparently healthy individuals; and
150 from medically diagnosed individuals with primary, secondary, or latent syphilis. All
cohorts were tested at three testing sites in a randomized and blinded fashion.
The clinical performance of the Access Syphilis assay was evaluated by calculating positive
percent agreement and negative percent agreement of the assay with the final comparator result
based on an algorithm of results from three FDA-cleared syphilis assays: a treponemal
chemiluminescent immunoassay (TP-CLIA), a nontreponemal assay (RPR), and a second
treponemal assay (TP-PA).
Clinical Performance in Prospectively Collected Specimens in the Intended Use Population
The 1104 prospectively collected specimens in the intended use population, analyzed in the
Access Syphilis clinical study consisted of 399 specimens sent for routine syphilis testing (201
females and 198 males, 12 to >89 years old), 405 pregnant females (16 to 46 years old), and 300
HIV-positive specimens (98 females and 202 males, 23 to 77 years old). Of the 1104
prospectively collected specimens, 55 were from patients ≤ 21 years old. Thirteen (13)
prospective specimens were excluded from analysis due to system error, duplicate testing, or
missing comparator result.
The comparison between the Access Syphilis result and the final comparator result for the
prospectively collected specimens in the intended use population is shown in the following table.
