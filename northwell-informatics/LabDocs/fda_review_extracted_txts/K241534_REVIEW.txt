B Indication(s) for Use:
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Syphilis Reagent Pack (VITROS Syphilis test)
For the qualitative determination of total (IgG and IgM) antibodies to Treponema pallidum (TP)
specific antigens in human serum and plasma using the VITROS 5600 Integrated System.
The presence of antibodies to Treponema pallidum (TP) specific antigens, in conjunction with
non-treponemal laboratory tests and clinical findings may aid in the diagnosis of syphilis
infection.
The VITROS Syphilis test is not intended for blood and tissue donor screening.
Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
C Special Instrument Requirements:
VITROS 5600 Integrated System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The VITROS Syphilis test is performed using the VITROS Syphilis Reagent Pack and VITROS
Syphilis Calibrator on the VITROS 5600 Integrated System. The reagents are provided ready to
use.
B Principle of Operation:
Assay Architecture
An immunometric technique is used; this involves a two-stage reaction. In the first stage,
antibodies to Syphilis TP specific antigens present in the sample bind with biotinylated
recombinant Syphilis TP antigens immobilized on streptavidin coated wells. Unbound sample is
removed by washing. In the second stage conjugate reagent containing horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-labeled recombinant Syphilis TP antigens is added. The conjugate binds specifically to
any antibody to Syphilis TP specific antigens captured on the well in the first stage. Unbound
conjugate is removed by washing.
The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent containing
luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent is
added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol
derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the
level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the system. The
amount of HRP conjugate bound is indicative of the amount of antibody to Syphilis TP specific
antigen present.

2. Linearity:
Not Applicable; this is a qualitative assay.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference by Endogenous Substances
The VITROS Syphilis test was evaluated for interference by testing syphilis non-reactive
(S/C approximately 0.2) and syphilis reactive (S/C of 1.5 to 4.0) samples. Test samples were
spiked with the test substance at the prescribed test levels and results were compared to
matched control samples spiked with an equal volume of solvent (blank). Paired difference
testing was performed using the median of four replicates of each test sample and each
control sample split across two reagent lots on the VITROS System. The mean bias for the
reactive samples ranged from -0.34 to 0.12. None of the 28 compounds were found to
interfere with the clinical interpretation of the assay at the concentrations indicated in the
table below.

separator tubes (PST), lithium heparin (LiHep) plasma, sodium heparin (NaHep) plasma, K2
EDTA plasma and K3 EDTA plasma was evaluated at room temperature (30°C), refrigerated
(2-8°C), and frozen (-20°C) storage conditions. The test samples were targeted as non-
reactive (result less than 0.50 S/C) and syphilis reactive (approximately 4.00 S/C) to assess
the performance of the assay near the cutoff. Twenty (20) samples were from presumed non-
reactive donors and were tested without spiking, and 23 samples were spiked to the targeted
S/C.
All samples were tested at every time point for the following storage conditions:
• Room temperature stability (at 30°C)
Time points tested: Day 0, Day 1, Day 7
o
• Refrigerated stability (at 2-8°C)
Time points tested: Day 0, Day 3 and Day 7
o
• Frozen stability (at -20°C)
Time points tested: Day 0, Day 7 and Day 28
o
• Freeze-thaw stability (at -20° C)
Conditions tested:1 and 5 freeze thaw cycles
o
All tests met the acceptance criteria for all the anti-coagulants and storage conditions tested.
Ortho is claiming the following storage conditions:
- Room temperature (up to 30°C) for 7 days
- Refrigerated (2-8°C) for 7 days
- Frozen (at -20°C) for 28 days
-Samples may be frozen and thawed up to 5 times
Reagent Stability
To evaluate the reagent stability and establish expiration dating of the VITROS Syphilis test,
three Kit Lots were tested at the initial time-point (baseline)and then at monthly intervals up
to the post expiry time-point to ensure that the stability trial performance can be accurately
defined. Kit Lots were stored at 2-8°C and tested for a period of 21 weeks. Four in house
quality control samples with S/C ratios (0.07, 3.15, 3.33 and 28.2) were tested in duplicates
at each time-point. All assays used in testing were verified as suitable for use by assessing the
appropriate Calibration Quality Parameters and by measuring the appropriate In-house
Controls against the specifications. All samples tested met the acceptance criteria. The data
currently supports a shelf life of 17 weeks when kept at 2 to 8°C.

On-board Reagent Stability
To assess the on-board stability of the VITROS Syphilis test reagents, three Kit Lots of the
reagent pack were stored on-board of the instrument (refrigerated) for up to 13 weeks. Four
in house quality controls with S/C ratios (0.07, 3.15, 3.33 and 28.2) were tested in duplicates
on each Kit Lot at time-point 0, week 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 13 using fresh and multi-use
packs of QC controls. All results were acceptable and support a claim of 12 weeks on-board
stability.
Calibration Stability/Interval
Calibration interval was established by monitoring test results of a set of spiked samples over
time, when run on the VITROS 5600 using a single calibration over the course of 60 days.
The target levels for syphilis reactivity (S/C) were approximately 0.80 (PP2), 1.30 (PP3),
2.00 (PP4) and 7.00 (PP5). The samples were aliquoted and stored frozen at ≤ -20°C until
thawed and tested each test day. Each aliquot was used for one test occasion only. Four
replicates of all samples were tested on two reagent lots on two VITROS 5600 Systems. The
calibration interval stability was evaluated by determining the mean bias on day 21, day 28
and day 60, compared to day 0. The calibration interval, as determined by day 21 and day 28
bias, passed for both reagent lots as shown below. The calibration interval, evaluated on day
60, failed the acceptance criteria (equal or more positive than -20% for Syphilis reactive
samples, and equal or less positive than 0.20 S/C for Syphilis negative samples (PP2). The
calibration stability has been demonstrated for 28 days.
Carryover
The potential carryover from samples with high level of TP antibodies, when using the
VITROS Syphilis assay on the VITROS 5600 Integrated System, was evaluated using a
syphilis non-reactive serum pool (prepared from healthy individuals) and a syphilis reactive
serum pool (prepared by spiking the non-reactive donor pool with syphilis reactive serum to
a S/C of greater than 100). Each test run consisted of five (5) replicates of the non-reactive
pool followed by ten (10) sets of alternating replicates between the non-reactive and reactive
pools. After completion of the alternating replicates, five (5) more replicates of the non-
reactive pool were tested. The 10 replicates of non-reactive pool executed at the beginning
and end of the run constitute baseline results for the non-reactive pool. The 10 replicates of
non-reactive pool generated by alternating with the reactive pool constitute interleaved
results.
The observed range of results for non-reactive sample replicates in the baseline runs was
0.019 S/C to 0.030 S/C. The range of observed results from the interleaved runs was 0.018
S/C to 0.030 S/C. The range between highest and lowest replicate in each sample set is
almost identical and spans 0.012 S/C, which is below the clinically significant bias,
demonstrating that there is no observable within assay sample carryover.
High dose hook effect
Not Applicable due to a two-step indirect immunoassay with a wash cycle.
Detection of IgG and IgM Antibodies
K241534 - Page 10 of 17

--- Page 11 ---
Three test methods were utilized to demonstrate the capability of the VITROS Syphilis test to
detect both IgG and IgM syphilis-specific antibodies: a) VITROS Syphilis test (Syph): to
capture and detect antibodies (IgG and IgM) specific for syphilis TP antigens; b) IgM Hybrid
Assay (IgM Hybrid): to illustrate the specific measurement of anti-Syphilis IgM; and c) IgG
Hybrid Assay (IgG Hybrid): to illustrate the specific measurement of anti-Syphilis IgG.
Syphilis reactive (16 samples) and non-reactive samples (5 samples) were selected based on
known results from the VITROS Syphilis test or from vendor documentation. VITROS
Syphilis Controls were tested on all three methods in singleton and all test samples were
tested in duplicate. Non-reactive samples showed low signal on both hybrid assays. Reactive
samples all showed signal above background in the IgG hybrid assay that increases based on
the sample group (4 groups- S/C ratios 1.0-10.0, 10.0-30.0, 30.0-100.0 and above 100) and
correlates with VITROS Syphilis results. Reactive specimens show variable results in the
IgM hybrid assay, which is expected based on the unknown and presumed variable maturity
of the immune response in these patients. After initial testing, a subset of samples was
selected for IgG stripping. In all cases signal in the IgG Hybrid assay was reduced to
background levels, IgM hybrid signal remained constant.
6. Detection Limit:
Not Applicable
7. Assay Cut-Off:
In order to define the cut-off, native human serum samples were measured with four lots of
the VITROS Syphilis test and a preliminary cut-off was set. The assay cutoff position was
determined using data collected during product development to optimize clinical sensitivity
and specificity. The results for clinical samples tested during feasibility testing were analyzed
using a receiver operator curve (ROC) to determine the optimal assay cut-off. All results
were generated using the assay cut-off generated using Reference Calibrator. Results from
performance validation testing (clinical trials) validate the selected assay cutoff.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
See Clinical Studies section below.
2. Matrix Comparison:
To verify the performance of the VITROS Syphilis test with different sample matrices,
serum, serum separator tubes (SST), plasma separator tubes (PST), lithium heparin plasma
(LiHep), sodium heparin plasma (NaHep), K EDTA plasma and K EDTA plasma from 63
2 3
individual whole blood donors were evaluated. Of the 63 whole blood samples, 10 were
unaltered and 53 were spiked using syphilis reactive serum or plasma (endogenous serum or
plasma samples previously identified or purchased as containing syphilis treponemal antigen
specific antibody). Syphilis reactive sample was added to the pooled whole blood for each
spiked sample and mixed thoroughly prior to distribution into the various collection devices.
A total of five levels of reactivity were evaluated:
• Negative, target S/C < 0.50
• High Negative, target S/C 0.50 to 0.90
• Low Positive, target S/C 1.10 to 2.00
• Positive 1, target S/C 2.00 to 5.00
K241534 - Page 11 of 17

--- Page 12 ---
• Positive 2, target S/C 5.00 to 30.0
• Positive 3, target S/C 30.0 and above
Each sample was tested in quadruplicate using one of two reagent lots and two VITROS
5600 Systems, and the mean of the results for each matrix type was compared to the mean of
the respective serum control tube. The data was tabulated for each matrix type and for each
sample. Clinical equivalence between serum samples and samples from each matrix type is
demonstrated if the observed mean bias is not clinically significant. A clinically significant
bias is defined as a mean bias between serum and test matrix that is equal to or more negative
than minus 20.0% for spiked Syphilis reactive samples and greater than or equal to +0.20 S/C
for Syphilis negative samples. Table below shows results for each sample type.

C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Performance:
A multicenter study was conducted on the VITROS 5600 Integrated System between June
2022 to August 2023 to evaluate the ability of the VITROS Syphilis assay to detect
antibodies (IgG and IgM) directed against Treponema pallidum (TP). A total of 1823
specimens were evaluated in the clinical study. Among these, 924 specimens were
prospectively collected in the US from individuals of all ages (all comers) representing the
intended use population, i.e., with signs or symptoms suggesting syphilis infection, at high
risk for exposure to syphilis, or prescribed a routine laboratory test for syphilis as part of
routine medical check-up, 698 specimens were purchased retrospective specimens, and 201
specimens were prospectively collected from apparently healthy individuals in the US. Of the
698 retrospective samples, 585 (83.8%) samples were collected in the US and 113 (16.2%)
samples were collected outside of the US.

The 924 prospective specimens analyzed in the VITROS Syphilis clinical study were
collected at clinical sites in the following geographic locations:

Overall 924 (100%) 23.7%
Testing with the VITROS Syphilis test was performed at three sites (two external and one
internal testing sites). Comparator testing was performed at one external CLIA compliant
laboratory. The clinical performance of the VITROS Syphilis test was evaluated by
calculating positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of the
assay with the final comparator result based on an algorithm of results from three FDA-
cleared Syphilis assays: a treponemal chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), a non-
treponemal RPR assay and a second treponemal assay- particle agglutination method. The
final comparator result was determined using a two-out-of-three rule (CLIA, RPR, and TP-
PA). Because the clinical diagnosis of syphilis must be supported by two reactive laboratory
tests, consisting of a treponemal assay and a non-treponemal assay, or at least two
treponemal assays, employing an algorithm of three syphilis assays to determine the
comparator result presents the most comprehensive picture of the syphilis serological status.
The clinical performance of the VITROS Syphilis assay was evaluated against the final
comparator result based on the composite algorithm, as indicated in the table below.

Of the total number of 1823 samples tested in the clinical study, 94 samples generated
exception codes on the initial testing and had to be retested. The rate of initial invalids in this
study was 5.1%. with each sample producing a final valid result upon retest.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Not applicable
E Expected Values:
A total of 924 prospectively collected specimens for the intended use population were tested with
the VITROS Syphilis assay. There were 235 reactive samples for a 25.4% positivity rate for the
presence of T. pallidum antibodies in the study population. The distribution of the VITROS
Syphilis reactive and non‑reactive results is summarized below by age and gender.
