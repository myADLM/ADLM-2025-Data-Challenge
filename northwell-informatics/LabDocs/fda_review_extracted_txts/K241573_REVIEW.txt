C Type of Test:
The Alinity m Resp-4-Plex is a multiplexed in vitro reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assay that amplifies and detects genomic RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2,
influenza A, influenza B, and RSV through sample preparation, PCR assembly, amplification,
and detection using real-time PCR. All steps of the assay are automated and performed on the
Alinity m System.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Alinity m Resp-4-Plex is a multiplexed real-time in vitro reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assay for use with the automated Alinity m System for the qualitative
detection and differentiation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-
2), influenza A virus, influenza B virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in
nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory
tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection due to SARS-CoV-2,
influenza A, influenza B, and RSV can be similar.
The Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay is intended for use in the differential detection of SARS-CoV-
2, influenza A, influenza B and/or RSV RNA and aids in the diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza
and/or RSV infections if used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological
information, and laboratory findings. SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV viral
RNA are generally detectable in nasopharyngeal swab specimens during the acute phase of
infection. This test is not intended to detect influenza C virus infections.
Positive results are indication of the presence of the identified virus, but do not rule out bacterial
infection or co-infection with other pathogens not detected by the test. The agent(s) detected by
the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay may not be the definite cause of disease.
Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and/or RSV infections
and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management
decisions.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use with the Alinity m System only.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
K241573 - Page 2 of 26

--- Page 3 ---
The Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay is a multiplex in vitro reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assay for use with the automated Alinity m System for the qualitative
detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV in
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract
infection.
B Principle of Operation:
The Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay requires two kits as follows:
• Alinity m Resp-4-Plex AMP Kit; 09N79-095, consists of 2 types of multi-well assay
trays. The amplification trays (AMP TRAY 1) contain unit-dose liquid PCR
amplification/detection reagents and unit-dose liquid Internal Control (IC) in separate
wells. The activation trays (ACT TRAY 2) contain liquid unit-dose activation reagent.
The intended storage condition for the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex AMP Kit is −25°C to
−15°C.
• Alinity m Resp-4-Plex CTRL Kit; 09N79-085, consists of negative controls and
positive controls, each supplied as liquid in single-use tubes. The intended storage
condition for the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex CTRL Kit is −25°C to −15°C.
The Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay utilizes real-time PCR to amplify and detect genomic RNA
sequences of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV from NP swab specimens. The
Alinity m Resp-4-Plex detects assay analytes and internal control (IC) separately, using analyte
specific probes. The assay targets two different genes within the SARS-CoV-2 genome: the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and nucleocapsid (N) gene, the matrix gene of the
influenza A genome, the nonstructural 1 gene of the influenza B genome, and the matrix gene of
the RSV genome. The fluorescently labeled probes do not generate a detectable signal unless
they are specifically bound to the amplified product. All probes are labeled with analyte specific
fluorophores, thus allowing for simultaneous detection and differentiation of amplified products
of all four viruses and IC in a single reaction vessel. The steps of the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex
assay consist of sample preparation, PCR assembly, amplification/detection, and result
calculation and reporting. All steps of the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay procedure are executed
automatically by the Alinity m System. The Alinity m System is designed to be a continuous
random-access analyzer that can perform the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay in parallel with other
Alinity m assays on the same instrument.
The Alinity m System performs automated sample preparation using the Alinity m Sample Prep
Kit 2, Alinity m Lysis Solution, and Alinity m Diluent Solution. The Alinity m System employs
magnetic microparticle technology to facilitate nucleic acid capture, wash, and elution. The IC is
introduced into each specimen at the beginning of the sample preparation process to demonstrate
that the process was completed correctly for each specimen and control sample.
The resulting purified RNA is combined with liquid unit-dose Alinity m Resp-4-Plex activation
reagent and liquid unit-dose Alinity m Resp-4-Plex amplification/detection reagent and
transferred into a reaction vessel. Alinity m Vapor Barrier Solution is then added to the reaction
vessel which is then transferred to an amplification/detection unit for reverse transcription, PCR
amplification, and real-time fluorescence detection.

A positive control and a negative control are tested at or above an established minimum
frequency to help ensure that instrument and reagent performance remain satisfactory. During
each control event, a negative control and positive control are processed through sample
preparation and PCR procedures that are identical to those used for specimens.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Alinity m System with software version 1.5.4
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification information is entered either manually or via barcode.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The samples may be loaded on the system in any order. The system pipettor robot dispenses
and aspirates liquids, as appropriate for each reaction. Sample handling and reagent transport
is performed by a handler robot.
4. Calibration:
Not applicable.
5. Quality Control:
The Alinity m Resp-4-Plex Control Kit consists of a negative control and a positive control
and are used for validity determination of the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay on the automated
Alinity m System. A Quality Control is defined as the set of assay controls that are, when
valid, necessary to allow reporting of specimen results. Each assay control is processed
through the same sample extraction and PCR procedure used for specimens.

1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a. Precision
The Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay within-laboratory precision was evaluated by testing
five panel members: one influenza A/influenza B/RSV/SARS-CoV-2 negative panel
member and four positive panel members. Un-spiked negative simulated nasal matrix
(NSM) was used as the influenza A/influenza B/RSV/SARS-CoV-2 negative panel
member. Positive panel members were prepared by spiking cultured viral stocks of
influenza A (H3N2/Switzerland/9715293/13), influenza B (Brisbane/33/08), RSV (B/
West Virginia/14617/85) and gamma irradiated SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) in
negative NSM to achieve 2x and 5x the assays claimed LoD for each analyte. The
composition of the panels is described in Table 1. Each panel member was tested with
four replicates twice each day for five days, on three Alinity m Systems operated by three
operators using three reagent lots (one reagent lot and one operator per system). The
qualitative and Cycle Number (CN) results for each analyte at each target level are
summarized in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.

panel composition is described in Table 4. All panel members were prepared in
simulated nasal matrix utilizing cultured viral stocks of influenza A
(H3N2/Switzerland/9715291/13), influenza B (Brisbane/33/08), RSV (B/West
Virginia/14617/85), and gamma irradiated SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020). A total of
three Alinity m Resp-4-Plex AMP kit lots were used. Each of the three external sites
tested two Alinity m Resp-4-Plex AMP kit lots on five non-consecutive days for each lot.
Four replicates of each panel member were tested on each of five days. The qualitative
results and Cycle Number (CN) analysis for the reproducibility study are shown in Table
5 and Table 6, respectively.

Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
a. Wet-Testing
This study was performed to determine the analytical reactivity of the Alinity m Resp-4-
Plex assay with clinically relevant strains, serotypes, or subtypes of the target species
(i.e., SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV). Inclusivity panels were created
by spiking virus strains at concentrations of 3x LoD if units of concentration matched that
of the LoD strains, or in a dilution series with a minimum of three concentration levels if
units of concentration did not match that of the LoD strains. The dilution series consisted
of at least one concentration that gave positive results 100% of the time and at least one
concentration that gave positive results <100% of the time. Strains that did not yield
100% reactivity at 3x LoD or any dilutions of the dilution series were prepared at higher
concentrations and tested until the minimum concentration that achieved 100% reactivity
was reached. Each panel was tested in replicates of five. All strains with the same
reported unit of concentration as reported for the assays LoD study yielded 100%

b. In silico
Inclusivity of the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay was also evaluated using in silico analysis
of SARS-CoV-2 primers and probes for homology with sequences available in GISAID
and NCBI databases.
For SARS-CoV-2, all available sequences up to October 3, 2023, from GISAID and up to
October 9, 2023 from NCBI databases were evaluated. Inclusivity was demonstrated by
analyzing the sequences of the RdRp and N primer/probe sets for homology with
14,818,776 unambiguous SARS-CoV-2 sequences available in the GISAID database. In
addition to the overall GISAID database, an analysis was also performed for the
sequences that have variant of concern (VOC) and variant of interest (VOI) variant
designation. Of the 14,818,776 total available sequences, 13,680,493 have current or
former VOC, VOI, and variant under monitoring (VUM) designation including Omicron
EG.5, Omicron B.1.640, Omicron XBB.1.16, Omicron XBB.1.5, Omicron BA.2.75,
Omicron BA.2.86, Omicron CH.1.1, Omicron XBB.1.9.1, Omicron XBB.1.9.2, Omicron
XBB.2.3, Omicron XBB, Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Epsilon, Eta, Iota, Kappa,
Lambda, Mu, Theta, and Zeta, among others. In silico analyses were also performed with
the full-length SARS-CoV-2 sequences available in the NCBI database of October 9,
2023. A total of 7,590,332 unambiguous sequences in the NCBI database were analyzed

for SARS-CoV-2 inclusivity. Analysis showed that greater than or equal to 99.99% of the
SARS-CoV-2 sequences evaluated are predicted to be detected by the Alinity m Resp-4-
Plex assay.
Cross-Reactivity/Microbial Interference
Wet-Testing
The impact of potentially cross-reacting microorganisms on the analytical specificity of the
Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay was assessed by adding microorganisms listed in Table 8 into
influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 negative samples to achieve a final titer of
105 units/mL (or higher) for viruses and fungi, 106 units/mL (or higher) for bacteria, 10% v/v
(or higher) of pooled human nasal wash, or the highest concentration available. The negative
sample was prepared by pooling negative clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens
prescreened to be negative for all four target analytes. The negative sample was also tested
without addition of any potential cross reactants (control condition).
Microbial interference was assessed by preparing cultured viral stocks of influenza A,
influenza B, RSV, and gamma irradiated SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in pooled negative
nasopharyngeal swab specimens at approximately 3x LoD for each analyte. The positive
sample was also tested without addition of any potential cross reactants (control condition).
A minimum of four replicates of each test condition and the control condition were tested
with the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay on the Alinity m System. No cross-reactivity or
microbial interference was observed at the concentrations tested.

Interfering Substances
The study assessed the impact of potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous
substances commonly encountered in the nasopharyngeal swab specimens on the detection of
the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay. Each of the potentially interfering substances were
evaluated in triplicate in two different positive panel members (PM) each containing multiple
analytes at 3x LoD in pooled negative clinical NP swab matrix. A minimum of three
replicates, for each of the two panel members, without any potentially interfering substances
were also tested as the control condition. The list of potentially interfering substances is
presented in Table 9 below. The panel member (PM) composition is presented below:
• PM 1: influenza A (A/Switzerland/9715293/13 (H3N2), influenza B
(B/Brisbane/33/08), RSV B (West Virginia/14617/85), and SARS-CoV-2 (USA-
WA1/2020 gamma-irradiated)
• PM 2: influenza A (A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)), influenza B
(B/Massachusetts/02/2012), and RSV A (Long/MD/56)
In addition, endogenous and exogenous substances were tested with the Alinity m Resp-4-
Plex assay in the absence of target analytes. FluMist was not evaluated in the absence of
target analytes due to the lack of availability of this substance at the time of testing. Four
replicates of each of the potentially interfering substances were evaluated in pooled negative
clinical NP swab matrix. A minimum of four replicates of pooled negative clinical NP swab
matrix without any potentially interfering substances were also tested as the control
condition.

Competitive Interference
The purpose of this study was to evaluate a potential competitive interference between target
analytes for the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay. Four panels were prepared for this study, each
consisting of three analytes at a low concentration (≤ 3x the claimed LoD of the respective
analyte) and the fourth analyte at a high concentration of 1 x 105 TCID /mL (>1000x LoD of
50
the respective analyte). A minimum of 20 replicates of each of the four panels were tested.
The viral strains used to prepare the panels are described in Table 10.1.

a Three Panel 1 samples had delayed Internal Control (IC). The analytes of these samples that tested “Negative” resulted in
Internal Control Failed error and were excluded from analysis, while the remaining analytes that tested “Positive” were
flagged, but included in analysis. Two additional replicates of Panel 1 were tested to meet the minimum number of
replicates. Results were valid (for all analytes) and included in the analysis.
b One Panel 3 sample had delayed Internal Control (IC). The analytes of this sample that tested “Negative” (influenza A,
RSV, and SARS-CoV-2) resulted in Internal Control Failed error and were excluded from analysis, while the analyte
(influenza B) that tested “Positive” was flagged but included in analysis. No additional testing was needed for Panel 3 as the
minimum number of replicates required per the protocol has been met.
c One Panel 4 sample was a “no test” due to instrument error and resulted in Background check on Amp-Detect unit 3 failed

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The Abbot m Resp-4-Plex assay was designed to report results through all 42 PCR cycles,
the maximum number of cycles for this assay. When an amplification of specimen occurred
between PCR cycles 1 to 42 (CN) and met the MR threshold (PCR efficiency-related
maximum ratio (MR)) the specimen was interpreted as Positive initially. Subsequently, a CN
cutoff for the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay was selected at 37.91 for SARS-CoV-2, 40.0 for
influenza A and influenza B, and 39.5 for RSV.
8. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable.
9. Carry-Over:
Potential carryover contamination for the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay was evaluated by
testing alternating replicates of high positive and negative samples. SARS-CoV-2 (as the
representative analyte) high-positive samples were prepared by diluting inactivated SARS-
CoV-2 into simulated nasal matrix to 2.0E+09 copies/mL. Unspiked simulated nasal matrix
served as the negative sample. SARS-CoV-2 high-positive and negative samples were tested
across a minimum of five Alinity m Resp-4-Plex AMP Trays on each of three Alinity m
systems (minimum total of 15 plates). Each AMP Tray tested 24 replicates of high-positive
sample and 24 replicates of negative sample arranged such that high-positive and negative
samples were processed in alternating reaction vessels. The Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay did
not exhibit carryover from high positive samples to negative samples. The carryover rate was

Matrix Equivalency - Simulated Nasal Matrix (SNM) vs. Pooled Clinical
Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate equivalence between simulated nasal matrix
(SNM) and pooled clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens (clinical NP pool) collected in
viral transport media (UTM) for Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay. The equivalence between
SNM and clinical NP pool was demonstrated by testing positive samples prepared with
cultured viral stocks of influenza A, influenza B, RSV and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in both
matrix types at approximately 1x and 5x the assay’s claimed Limit of Detection (LoD) for the
respective analyte. Twenty-one replicates were tested at 1x LoD and 10 replicates were tested
at 5x LoD for each matrix type.
Positivity (detection) rates observed in both SNM, and clinical NP Pool were greater than or
equal to 95% for all analytes tested targeted at 1x LoD level and equal to 100% for all
analytes at 5x LoD. Results are summarized in Table 15 below. Based on this data, Alinity m
Resp-4-Plex assay performance is equivalent in SNM and pooled clinical nasopharyngeal
swab specimens.

Prospective Clinical Study
The performance of the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay was evaluated in a multicenter study
using prospectively collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens in UVT or UTM from
individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infections. A total of four
US clinical sites tested the specimens with the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay. All four sites
tested specimens for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV performance, and three of the four
sites tested specimens for SARS-CoV-2 performance.
Specimens collected for SARS-CoV-2 performance evaluation were collected at ten
geographically distributed locations in the US over two time periods; between December 2,
2020 and February 10, 2021 and between May 8, 2023 through May 31, 2023. A total of 874
specimens were tested, of which 48 results were excluded due to invalid results of the
candidate device and 128 were excluded due to no composite comparator results, leaving 698
valid SARS-CoV-2 results.
The specimens for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV performance evaluation were collected
during the 2021-2022 viral respiratory season at seven geographically distributed locations in
the US and during the 2020 viral respiratory season at one location in the Southern
Hemisphere. All specimens collected in the Southern Hemisphere were frozen and shipped to
a US testing site for candidate and comparator device testing. Valid Alinity m Resp-4-Plex
results included 2,753 each for influenza A and influenza B analytes (from 2,453 US
specimens and 300 specimens from outside the US), and 2,745 for RSV analyte (from 2,445
US specimens and 300 specimens from outside the US). Of these, 2,504 influenza A results,
2,710 influenza B results, and 2,700 RSV results from the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay were
used in the analysis. Composite comparator results could not be determined for 249
specimens for influenza A, 43 specimens for influenza B, and 45 specimens for RSV.
Demographic characteristics for the subjects included in the analysis from the prospective
population are shown in Table 16 for the evaluation of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV
and Table 17 for SARS-CoV-2.

For the evaluation of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV, the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex results
were compared to a composite comparator (CC) established using two to three FDA cleared
assays for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. For evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 performance,
the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex results were compared to CC established using two to three highly
sensitive EUA SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays. Specimens were tested with up to three
comparator assays, volume availability permitting. For each analyte, a minimum of two
concordant comparator assays results were needed to establish CC for each subject. In cases
where results between two comparator tests differed in qualitative results or one of the
comparator tests did not have a valid result, a third comparator test was used as a tiebreaker
to determine CC. A specimen was categorized as CC positive if a minimum of two
comparator positive results were reported. A specimen was categorized as CC negative if two
or more comparator results were negative. A specimen was categorized as indeterminate
(IND) if CC could not be determined due to missing results from the comparator assays.
Specimens with an Indeterminate (IND) CC were excluded from analyses.
The performance of the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay with prospective specimens is
summarized in Table 18. Alinity m Resp-4-Plex results were compared to composite
comparator by the analysis of positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent
agreement (NPA). PPA was not calculated for the influenza B analyte because there was no
CC positive specimen in the prospective study.

Retrospective Clinical Study
Influenza B prevalence was very low during the prospective clinical study; there was no
comparator positive specimen to evaluate the performance of the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex
assay. To supplement the results of the prospective specimen population, retrospective
specimen testing was performed using preselected archived influenza B positive NP swab
specimens in UVT or UTM collected during the 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 influenza
seasons, which were randomly mixed with known negative specimens to target 10%
influenza B prevalence. The specimens were tested with both Alinity m Resp-4-Plex and
FDA cleared comparators for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. A total of 515 valid Alinity
m Resp-4-Plex results were obtained for each of the influenza A, influenza B, and RSV
analytes. Of these, 506 influenza A results, 504 of influenza B results, and 505 RSV results
were used in the analysis. Composite comparator results could not be determined for nine
specimens for influenza A, 11 specimens for influenza B, and ten specimens for RSV.
Demographic characteristics for the subjects included in the analysis from the retrospective
population are shown in Table 19.
