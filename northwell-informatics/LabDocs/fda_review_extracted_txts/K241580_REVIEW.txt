C Type of Test:
Qualitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 is a real-time in vitro reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) assay for use with the automated Alinity m System for the qualitative detection of
nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 from patients with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens.
Results are for the detection and identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Alinity m SARS-CoV-2
assay is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19 if used in conjunction with
other clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory findings. Positive results are indicative of the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic
information is necessary to determine patient infection status. Positive results do not rule out
bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses.
Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical
observations, patient history, and epidemiological information.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
All steps of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay procedure are executed on the Alinity m System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay consists of 2 reagent kits:
• Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 AMP Kit (09N78-096) is comprised of 2 types of multi-well trays:
Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 AMP TRAY 1 and Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 ACT TRAY 2. The
intended storage condition for the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 AMP Kit is –15°C to –25°C.
• Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 CTRL Kit (09N78-086) consists of negative controls and positive
controls, each supplied as liquid in single-use tubes. The intended storage condition for the
Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 Control Kit is –15°C to –25°C.
K241580 - Page 2 of 38

--- Page 3 ---
The Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay may utilize the following for collection and transport of
anterior nasal swab specimens:
• Abbott Universal Collection Kit (09N92-030) consists of one Transport Tube with a solid cap
containing 1.65 mL Specimen Transport Buffer and one sterile Specimen Collection Swab. The
intended storage condition for the Abbott Universal Collection Kit is 15°C to 30°C.
• Abbott Universal Collection Kit II (09N92-040) consists of one Transport Tube with a
pierceable cap containing 1.65 mL Specimen Transport Buffer, one sterile Specimen Collection
Swab, and one absorbent pad. The intended storage condition for the Abbott Universal
Collection Kit is 15°C to 30°C.
Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 is a real-time in vitro reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) assay for use with the automated Alinity m System for the qualitative detection of
nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms
of COVID-19.
The steps of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay consist of sample preparation, RT-PCR assembly,
amplification/detection, and result reporting. All stages of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay
procedure are executed automatically by the Alinity m System. No intermediate processing or
transfer steps are performed by the user. The Alinity m System is designed to be a random-
access analyzer that can perform the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay in parallel with other Alinity
m assays on the same instrument.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA from specimens are extracted automatically on-board the Alinity m System
using the Alinity m Sample Prep Kit 2, Alinity m Lysis Solution, and Alinity m Diluent Solution.
The Alinity m System employs magnetic microparticle technology to facilitate nucleic acid
capture, wash and elution. The resulting purified nucleic acids are then combined with the liquid
unit-dose activation reagent, liquid unit-dose amplification reagents, and Alinity m Vapor Barrier
Solution, and transferred by the instrument to an amplification/detection module for reverse
transcription, PCR amplification, and real-time fluorescence detection.
The Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 amplification reagents include primers and probes that amplify and
detect an exogenous internal control (containing an armored RNA sequence). Amplification and
detection of the internal control demonstrates proper sample processing. The internal control is
used to demonstrate assay validity.
Assay controls are tested to help ensure that instrument and reagent performance remain
satisfactory. During each control event, a negative control and a positive control are processed
through sample preparation and RT-PCR procedures that are identical to those used for
specimens. Assay controls are used to demonstrate proper sample processing and assay validity.
Each Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 CTRL kit contains 12 vials (1.3 mL fill volume) of Negative
Control and 12 vials (1.3 mL fill volume) of Positive Control.
Specimen Collection
Nasopharyngeal or anterior nasal swab specimens collected in viral transport media (BD UVT or
Copan UTM). The Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay may utilize the following for collection and
transport of anterior nasal swab specimens:
K241580 - Page 3 of 38

--- Page 4 ---
• Abbott Universal Collection Kit (09N92-030)
• Abbott Universal Collection Kit II (09N92-040).
B Principle of Operation:
The Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay utilizes real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify
and detect genomic RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal
swab specimens. The Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 is designed to target two highly conserved
sequences within the SARS-CoV-2 genome: the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and
Nucleocapsid (N) genes. The RdRp and N probes utilized in the SARS-CoV-2 dual-target design
are labeled with the same fluorophore. Therefore, amplification of both SARS-CoV-2 targets is
detected as a single fluorescent signal during real-time PCR. The steps of the Alinity m SARS-
CoV-2 assay consist of sample preparation, PCR assembly, amplification/detection, and result
calculation and reporting. All steps of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay procedure are executed
automatically by the Alinity m System. The Alinity m System is designed to be a random-access
analyzer that can perform the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay in parallel with other Alinity m
assays on the same instrument.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Alinity m System.
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification information is entered either manually or via barcode.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The samples may be loaded on the system in any order. The system pipettor robot dispenses
and aspirates liquids, as appropriate for each reaction. Sample handling and reagent transport
is performed by a handler robot.
4. Calibration:
Not Applicable
5. Quality Control:
Alinity assays utilize quality controls to periodically monitor the performance of assay
reagents and of the Alinity m System. A QC is defined as the set of assay controls that are,
when valid, necessary to allow reporting of specimen results. A QC in this context consists of
a negative control and positive control(s). Each assay control is processed through the same
sample extraction and PCR procedure used for specimens.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a. Within-Laboratory Precision
Within-laboratory precision was evaluated at a single site for the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay
using Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 reagents and the Alinity m System with a total of three panels
(negative samples, positive samples spiked with SARS-CoV-2 at 2X LoD, and 5X LoD) in a
negative Simulated Nasal Matrix (SNM). Positive panel members were prepared by diluting
gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus in SNM. Un-spiked SNM was used as the SARS-CoV-2
negative panel member. Three operator/instrument/lot combinations were tested for each panel
member using Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 Amplification Reagent Kits on five days with two runs
per day and four replicates per run, resulting in a total of 120 replicates per panel member (40
replicates per operator/instrument/lot combination). Each Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 AMP Kit
reagent lot was assigned to a specific Alinity m System and each operator was assigned to one
lot/Alinity m System combination. Precision study results are summarized in Table 1.

Low positive panel members were positive at 99.2% (118/119) while moderate positive
panel members were positive at 100% (120/120) for the spiked analyte. The negative
panel members were 100% negative.
b. Within-Laboratory Precision – Testing Specimens in Universal Collection Kits Buffer
An additional precision study was carried out to assess precision by testing specimens in
SNM in the Abbott Universal Collection Kits (UCKs) transport buffer. Precision was
evaluated for the Alinity mSARS-CoV-2 assay by testing three panel members (negative
samples, positive samples spiked with SARS-CoV-2 at 2X LoD, and 5X LoD) prepared
in a negative matrix simulating clinical specimens collected in the Universal Collection

testing samples collected in Universal Collection Kit buffer.
c. Reproducibility
Reproducibility of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay was evaluated at three external
testing sites by testing a three-member panel prepared in SNM. The two positive panel
members consisted of one moderate positive panel member containing gamma irradiated
SARS-CoV-2 virus at approximately 5X LoD and one low positive panel member
containing gamma irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus at approximately 2X LoD. Negative
SNM was used as a negative panel member.

acceptable assay reproducibility.
2. Linearity:
A Linearity Study is not applicable because the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay is a qualitative
assay.
3. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
The inclusivity of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 Assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 was
evaluated using a combination of in silico analysis of publicly available sequence
information and laboratory (wet) testing of seven isolates of SARS-CoV-2 from six different
geographical regions. Seven different strains/isolates were tested at 3X the assay’s LoD and
were prepared in negative nasopharyngeal matrix with either purified genomic RNA from the
SARS-CoV-2 isolates or inactivated virus. Each strain/isolate was tested in five replicates
and results are presented in Table 5.

In Silico
The inclusivity of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 Assay was evaluated using in silico
analysis of the primers and probes for the ability to detect various strains of the SARS-
CoV-2 virus. Primer and probe sequences for SARS-CoV-2 detection were analyzed for
homology with sequences available in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data
(GISAID, as of October 11, 2023) and National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI, available as of October 10, 2023) databases and the potential impact of any
mismatches and the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated.
Inclusivity was demonstrated by analyzing the sequences of the RdRp and N
primer/probe sets for homology with 14,818,776 unambiguous SARS-CoV-2 sequences
available in the GISAID database. In addition, an analysis was performed for the
sequences that have variant of concern (VOC) and variant of interest (VOI) variant
designation. Of the 14,818,776 total available sequences, 13,680,493 have current (as of
October 10, 2023) or former VOC, VOI, and variant under monitoring (VUM)
designation including Omicron EG.5, Omicron B.1.640, Omicron XBB.1.16, Omicron
XBB.1.5, Omicron BA.2.75, Omicron BA.2.86, Omicron CH.1.1, Omicron XBB.1.9.1,
Omicron XBB.1.9.2, Omicron XBB.2.3, Omicron XBB, Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma,
Epsilon, Eta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, Theta, and Zeta, among others.
In silico analyses were also performed with the full-length SARS-CoV-2 sequences
available in the NCBI database A total of 7,590,332 unambiguous sequences in the
NCBI database were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 inclusivity.
The sequences were evaluated for a mismatch in either RdRp or N gene target regions.
The impact of any mismatches on the amplification and detection of each target region
was assessed.
GSAID Database
14,764,951 (99.64%) available sequences in the GISAID database either had no
mismatches or had mismatches in one of the assay target regions. These sequences were
predicted to have no impact on the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The remaining 53,825
(0.36%) sequences contained at least one mismatch in both of the assay target regions.
53,754 of these sequences were predicted to be unlikely to impact the detection of SARS-
CoV-2.

Among the 13,680,493 sequences available in the GISAID database that had VOC and
VOI designation, 13,628,903 sequences (99.6%) either had no mismatches in the assay
target regions or had mismatches in one of the target regions. One VUM Omicron
(XBB.1.9.1+XBB.1.9.1.*), one former VOC Alpha, six former VOC Omicron
(B.1.1.529+BA.*) variants, and 59 former VOC Delta variants are potentially impacted.
Considering the extremely low prevalence of those potentially impacted, and de-escalated
status of most impacted variants, the analysis predicts no impact on the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 among former or current VOC, VOI and VUM.
NCBI Database
Among the 7,590,332 unambiguous sequences, 7,559,687 (99.6%) have either no
mismatches in the assay target regions (RdRp and N gene targets) or have mismatches in
only one of the target regions. These sequences are predicted not to impact the detection
of SARS-CoV-2. The remaining 30,645 (0.4%) isolates contained at least one mismatch
in both the RdRp and N gene target regions.
The overall potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 detection is considered likely only when
both RdRp and N genes are potentially impacted. Among the 30,645 sequences
containing at least one mismatch in both target regions, 30,602 were predicted unlikely to
impact the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Among the SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the NCBI
database, 43 isolates are predicted to be potentially impacted by mismatches.
The majority of sequences evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 are expected to be detected by the
Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 Assay.
A summary of the in-silico analyses is presented in Table 6.

4. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-Reactivity
This study evaluated the analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2
Assay in the presence of non-targeted microorganisms that may be found in a respiratory tract
clinical specimen. Fifty-three microorganisms listed in Table 7 were evaluated in the study
and were inoculated into SARS-CoV-2 negative samples to achieve a final titer of 105
units/mL for viruses and fungi, 106 units/mL for bacteria, and 10% of pooled human nasal
wash. Whole microorganisms were used in this study whenever possible. Purified nucleic acid
was utilized in cases where the microorganism was not available. The SARS-CoV-2 negative

Interfering Substances – Nasal Swab (NS) Samples in the Abbott Universal Collection Kit or
Abbott Universal Collection Kit II
An analytical study was performed to evaluate the performance of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-
2 assay when testing nasal swab samples prepared using the Abbott Universal Collection Kit
or the Abbott Universal Collection Kit II buffer and containing potentially interfering
endogenous and exogenous substances.
The SARS-CoV-2 positive sample at 3X LoD was prepared by spiking gamma irradiated SARS-
CoV-2 virus into pooled negative clinical NS specimens prepared using the Abbott Universal
Collection Kit or the Abbott Universal Collection Kit II. A minimum of three replicates of each
test condition were tested along with the control condition on the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay.

Limit of Detection (LoD) - Nasopharyngeal Swabs in UVT/UTM
The LoD of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay was determined with the analysis of a
dilution series of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasopharyngeal swab specimens in
UVT/UTM. Dilutions of gamma irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus were prepared in pooled
SARS-CoV-2 negative clinical nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens in UVT/UTM.
The preliminary LoD assessment was carried out by testing replicates of three at the
following SARS-CoV-2 target concentrations (TCID /mL): 0.0180, 0.0090, 0.0045, and
50
0. The preliminary LoD of 0.0090 TCID /mL was confirmed by testing 21 replicates.

8. Assay Cut-Off:
The assay was designed to report results through all 42 PCR cycles—the maximum number
of cycles for this assay. When an amplification of specimen occurred between PCR cycles 1
to 42 (CN) and met the MR threshold (PCR efficiency-related maximum ratio (MR)) the
specimen was interpreted as Positive initially. Subsequently, a CN cutoff for the Alinity m
SARS-CoV-2 assay was selected at 39.57.
9. Carry-Over:
An analytical study was performed to assess potential carry-over or cross-contamination in
the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay by testing high positive and negative samples in an
alternating fashion on the Alinity m System. Testing with each AMP Tray consisted of 24
replicates of high-positive sample prepared at 2.0 x 109 Copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2
material and 24 replicates of negative sample. Sample replicates were arranged such that
high-positive and negative samples are processed in alternating reaction vessels. The carry-
over contamination study tested an array of 363 high-positive samples and 361 negative
samples across five Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 AMP Trays on each of three Alinity m
systems. Results are presented in Table 25.

1. Matrix Comparison:
Simulated Nasal Matrix (SNM) and Clinical Matrix Equivalency Study
To evaluate the equivalence of SNM used in analytical studies with natural clinical matrix,
SNM was formulated and tested side by side with clinical nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)
specimens collected in UVT/UTM, clinical nasal swab (NS) specimens in collected
UVT/UTM, and clinical NS specimens collected in the Universal Collection Kits (UCK)
transport buffer.

Each matrix was evaluated by testing four panel members: a negative panel member and
three positive panel members which were prepared by the spiking cultured SARS-CoV-2
virus in each type of matrix at 0.5x LoD, 1x LoD, and 3x LoD. For each matrix and panel
member 21 replicates were tested to achieve a minimum of 20 replicates. The testing was
performed using Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay reagents and the Alinity m System. Results

C Clinical Studies:
Prospective Clinical Studies
The clinical performance of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay was established in two
clinical studies that tested prospective clinical specimens in viral transport media (UVT
or UTM) and in Universal Collection Kit (UCK) from individuals with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection.
Composite Comparator (CC) Definition
A minimum of two and up to three highly sensitive SARS-CoV-2 molecular EUA
assays were used as comparator assays to establish the composite comparator
(CC) for assessing the performance of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay. A
specimen was categorized as CC positive if a minimum of two comparator
positive results were reported. A specimen was categorized as CC negative if
two or more comparator results were negative. A specimen was categorized as
indeterminate (IND) if CC could not be determined due to missing results from
the comparator assays. Specimens with an Indeterminate CC result were
excluded from analyses.
I. Prospective Clinical Study – Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens
Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were prospectively collected at eight geographically
distinct sites in the U.S. Specimens were collected in BD Universal Viral Transport
(UVT) with a flocked swab between January 2021 and February 2021.Of the 627 NPS
specimens from symptomatic subjects tested, 580 samples were Category I specimens,
while 47 were Category II specimens. Of the initial 627 specimens tested, 16 were
excluded as invalid with no result obtained and 76 specimens were excluded for having
no composite comparator result. Five hundred thirty-five NPS specimens were included
for performance analysis. Patient demographic information for the 535 specimens with
valid CC results that were included in performance analysis in the prospective clinical
study are presented in Table 27.

invalid for a final invalid rate of 2.7% (95% CI: 1.7% - 4.3%).
II. Prospective Clinical Study – Anterior Nasal Swab Specimens
This prospective clinical study used anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens (two
per patient) that were self-collected under HCP supervision in the Abbott
Universal Collection Kit II (UCK) and in the Universal Viral Transport (UVT).
ANS samples were collected between September 2021 and January 2022. Adult
and pediatric subjects, presenting signs and symptoms consistent with
respiratory tract infection and/or COVID-19 were enrolled for specimen
collection. Subject demographics are presented in Table 29.
