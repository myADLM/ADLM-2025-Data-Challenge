The YO Home Sperm Test (YO 3.0) does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of a male's
fertility status and is intended for in vitro, over the counter only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The YO Home Sperm Test (YO 3.0) is a smartphone-based, over-the-counter, home test for
semen analysis performed by lay users that provides a quantitative analysis of total sperm
concentration, total motile/motility, progressive motility, motile sperm concentration (MSC) and
progressively motile sperm concentration (PMSC). The YO Home Sperm Test (YO 3.0) utilizes
proprietary algorithms to both conduct semen analysis and present and store the results and
videos on the user’s smartphone and in the cloud. The YO application (app) is downloaded onto
the user’s own smartphone (iPhone/Android) and is controlled by the user through a proprietary
graphical interface (GUI). The GUI guides the user through the process step by step on the App’s
screen and operates the YO device.
The YO Home Sperm Test kit provides the supplies necessary to test up to six semen samples
and contains:
• Plastic cups for collecting the semen sample
• Fixed coverslip slides
• Vials containing 5 mg chymotrypsin liquefaction media
• Disposable plastic pipettes for sample aspiration and delivery to the fixed
coverslip slide
• YO Device
• USB cable for connecting the YO device to the user’s smartphone/PC
• Indications for Use
K241628 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The plastic YO device contains a fixed coverslip slide insertion channel, magnification lens, lens
holder, WiFi camera and an LED that lights up the optical path. A specimen-filled slide is
inserted into the OTC device unit and illuminated by the light source. The image is magnified by
a magnification lens in the YO device and projected to the image sensors (YO camera). The
camera transmits the video to the smartphone. The YO software captures a video in HD (high
definition) mode and implements a unique software algorithm to identify sperm and analyze the
light fluctuations resulting from sperm movement to report semen values. The algorithm
recognizes when the YO autofocus function has the best image and then defines the optimal area
of the video for analysis. MSC/PMSC are measured by capturing a video of sperm cells in high
definition (HD) mode, and analyzing the moving and total spermatozoa, expressed in millions
per milliliter (M/mL). Sperm concentration is calculated by counting the objects from the same
sperm video and classifying them as sperm cells.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
YO Home Sperm Test
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is not required because the YO Home Sperm Test is intended for a
single user at home.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The users are instructed to wash their hands with soap and water before and after handling
their semen sample or test components. If the user is running the test for someone else, the
user will wear exam gloves. When instructed by the YO app, the user collects the sample
directly into the sample container provided in the YO kit. The sample should be placed at
room temperature. Once the user places the liquefaction powder into the sample as directed
in the application, the user should wait ten minutes before testing as instructed. The App
instructs the user to not wait longer than one hour from collection to test the sample.
4. Calibration:
Not applicable.
5. Quality Control:
Internal controls are performed automatically and internally. The software checks that the
video signal is stabilized and running smoothly for analysis and that the video is not black or
blank.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability
Seventy-eight lay users at three US sites tested their own samples in triplicate using multiple
devices and three different slide lots (one per site). Parameters reported were sperm
concentration, motile sperm concentration, progressively motile sperm concentration,
motility and progressive motility. The Standard deviations (SDs) and percent coefficients of
variation (%CVs) were calculated for each sample. The samples spanned the sperm
concentration range of 2–150 M/mL. The results from all samples demonstrated acceptable
repeatability of the device used by lay users.
Reproducibility
Sixteen native semen samples, representing different levels of sperm concentration, motile
sperm concentration and progressively motile sperm concentration were assayed in duplicate
on three devices at three sites over four timepoints. Due to limited stability of semen
samples, each “day” is represented by different times of day with testing at four different
timepoints, resulting in 24 replicates per sample for each of the five parameters. Standard
deviations (SDs) and percent coefficients of variation (%CVs) were calculated for each
sample. The results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

2. Linearity:
Linearity of the YO Home Sperm Test (YO 3.0) was evaluated for the sperm concentration
using three YO 3.0 devices with one replicate per device. Native semen samples were
prepared by pooling native samples from ten donors and concentrating sperm via
centrifugation and removal of the supernatant. The sperm pellet was aliquoted into seminal
plasma and the low-level concentration sample was confirmed by testing with the SQA-V
comparator. The sperm concentration was demonstrated to be linear from 2–150 M/mL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The potential interference of various substances on YO 3 were evaluated by using two sperm
concentration levels (20–60 M/mL and 60–100 M/mL). The parameters of sperm
concentration, motile sperm concentration and progressively motile sperm concentration
were evaluated. The following 11 interfering substances were tested in the study at the
recommended level: yeast, E. coli, Vitamin B12, urine, saliva, red blood cells (RBCs), white
blood cells (WBCs), testosterone, β-estradiol, D-norgestrel and agglutinates. Samples were
compared to a native control sample composed of seminal plasma. Results showed that all
tested interfering substances met the acceptance criteria, so no significant interference was
caused by the tested substances at the evaluated level.
4. Accuracy (Instrument)
Method Comparison
The method comparison study was conducted at three U.S. sites and included 309 native
semen samples with approximately 100 semen samples per site, assayed in singleton and in a
blinded fashion by the intended users. The intended users analyzed their own samples. In
addition, some female intended users were enrolled to test donor semen samples. In parallel,
trained operators tested the sample on the SQA-V comparator device. The data were
analyzed by the Passing-Bablok regression, and the results are shown in the table below. The
results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

B Expected Values/Reference Range:
The lower limit of the reference range for parameters Total Sperm Concentration, Total Motility
(%), and Progressive Motility (%) (including rapidly and slowly progressive motility) were
directly reported as the 5th percentile in the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and
Processing of Human Semen, 6th Edition (Table 8.3). The lower limit of the reference range for
parameters Motile Sperm Concentration and Progressive Motile Sperm Concentration (including
Rapid and Slow PMSC) were calculated as the 5th percentile based on the raw data from the
study conducted by Campbell et al1.

C Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1. Sample Stability
A sample stability study was performed to demonstrate stability of labile motility-related
semen parameters in different time intervals. Ten random liquified native semen samples
were assessed in duplicate by two operators using two YO 3 devices with two lots of testing
YO slides and one SQA-V comparator device with two lots of testing capillaries in the
following time intervals of sample collection: one hour, two hours, three hours, and four
hours. Averages of motility-related semen parameters (total motility, MSC and PMSC) were
assessed at the time intervals and their results were compared to their initial (T0) results. The
study results support the recommendations as per the WHO 6th Edition to perform semen
analysis on the YO 3 within one hour of collection.
2. Detection Limit
A study was conducted to determine the detection limits of the sperm concentration analyzed
with the YO Home Sperm Test. Blank seminal plasma was used to represent a surrogate for
the blank sample. Low level semen samples were prepared by pooling three donor semen
samples and concentrating sperm via centrifugation and removal of the supernatant. The cell
pellet was resuspended in seminal plasma to a concentration of approximately 2–8 M/mL as
verified by microscope. Results were calculated and the detection limits were determined to
be:
