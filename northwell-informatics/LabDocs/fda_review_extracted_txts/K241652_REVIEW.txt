C Type of Test:
The DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test is a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) test.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test is a rapid reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assay performed on the DASH Rapid PCR Instrument and is intended for the
simultaneous in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and
influenza B virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) in anterior nasal swab specimens from patients with
signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection. The test is intended to aid in the differential
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B in humans in conjunction with other
clinical, epidemiologic and laboratory findings.
Positive results of a specific target are indicative of the presence of that viral RNA and may not
be the definite cause of disease. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other
pathogens. Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2, influenza A or influenza B infection
and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IVD - For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DASH Rapid PCR Instrument (DASH Instrument)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test is a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) assay for rapid qualitative detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A
(Flu A) and influenza B (Flu B) from human anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens. The test
combines the technologies of sequence specific capture sample preparation and RT-PCR
amplification. An anterior nasal swab with a 30-mm breakpoint is used to collect a specimen.
The ANS specimen is added directly to the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test cartridge
sample chamber. The DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test cartridge contains all reagents
necessary to perform the test. The cartridge is capped and inserted into the DASH Instrument to
initiate the test, and all subsequent test steps are performed automatically by the DASH
Instrument.
Materials included with the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test consist of the following:
• Ten individually pouched DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Cartridges per kit
K241652 - Page 2 of 25

--- Page 3 ---
• Ten individually packaged anterior nares sample collection swabs (30 mm breakpoint,
sterile elongated polyester flock) per kit
• DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test Quick Reference Instructions (QRI).
The DASH Instrument, DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Positive Control Swabs Kit, and DASH
Negative Control Swabs Kit are provided separately.
B Principle of Operation:
The DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test combines the technologies of sequence specific
capture sample preparation and RT-PCR amplification. The DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B
Test cartridge contains all reagents necessary to perform the test to detect RNA from SARS-
CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B.
An ANS sample is collected and added directly to the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test
cartridge. The Test cartridge is capped and inserted into the DASH Instrument to initiate the test.
The Test cartridge sample chamber contains lysis buffer which releases the RNA target from the
virus. The target RNA molecules are isolated from specimens by use of biotinylated capture
oligomers (capture oligomers) which are in turn captured by streptavidin-coated paramagnetic
particles. The biotinylated capture oligomers contain sequences complementary to specific
regions of the RNA target molecules. During the hybridization step, the sequence specific
regions of the capture oligomers bind to specific regions of the RNA target molecules. The
capture oligomer:target complex is then concentrated by the addition of streptavidin-coated
paramagnetic particles.
The paramagnetic particles, including the bound target molecules, are washed to remove residual
specimen matrix that may contain amplification reaction inhibitors. After the target capture steps
are completed, the target RNA is ready for RT-PCR amplification. Forty amplification cycles are
performed, during which the fluorescence is measured with a four-color LED fluorometer.
Amplification of any assay targets, Flu A, Flu B, and SARS-CoV-2, leads to fluorescent signal.
An algorithm determines whether the result is positive or negative for each viral target assay.
Additionally, a process control is included in the cartridge to control for adequate processing of
the target virus through the steps of sample purification, nucleic acid amplification and to
monitor for the presence of inhibitors in the RT-PCR reaction. Total run time, from swab
insertion into the Test cartridge to display of the test results is approximately 15 minutes.
The DASH Instrument contains firmware and software that operate the instrument and analyze
the assay data. Test results are displayed on the DASH Instrument screen and can be printed
(optional) after the test has been completed. The procedural control will display “Valid” on the
results screen for all samples, both negative and positive (see Table 1 below), to indicate that the
test results may be reported.

C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
DASH Rapid PCR Instrument (DASH Instrument)
2. Specimen Identification:
DASH Instrument is connected to a barcode reader which scans specimen and Test cartridge
labels.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The anterior nasal swab specimen is collected and added directly to the DASH SARS-CoV-2
& Flu A/B Test cartridge sample chamber. No collection media is used to store the swab.
Each sample is processed individually.
4. Calibration:
Not applicable.
5. Quality Control:
• Procedural Control
An assay targeting the bacteriophage MS2 is built-in the Test cartridge as the Procedural
Control (PRC) that undergoes identical processing to the patient specimen which
provides confirmation that the test procedure was executed correctly. If the test fails for
any reason, the PRC result will be reported as an INVALID and the operator is instructed
in the labelling to test the sample again with another test device.
• External Controls
The DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Positive Control and DASH Negative Control
swabs are available separately for use as external controls. External controls are tested
using the same procedure that is used to test a patient specimen.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a) Precision/Repeatability
Precision of the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test was evaluated over a 12-day period,
conducted by two operators at a single site, and resulted in 96 replicates per concentration of
the SARS-CoV-2, Flu A and Flu B targets. Test samples were contrived in simulated clinical
nasal matrix, co-spiked with SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, and Flu B to target concentrations. Three
panel members were prepared: true negative (unspiked), low positive (2x LoD (near Limit of
Detection)), and moderate positive (5x LoD). The test samples were prepared by applying the
contrived viral dilutions onto the swabs. The samples were randomized and blind-coded.
Each operator tested two replicates of each sample in each run (two runs per day), for a total
of 96 replicates per panel member. Four DASH Instruments were utilized during the
execution of this study. Results are summarized in the table below.

b) Reproducibility
Another study was conducted to evaluate the reproducibility of the DASH SARS-CoV-2 &
Flu A/B Test at three external CLIA-waived sites with a total of nine untrained operators. A
total of three lots of the Test cartridges were used. Operators tested a randomized blind-
coded panel of contrived samples at three concentration levels (prepared in the same manner
as above for the precision study), with three replicates per level tested by each operator over
five days. There were 270 replicates of each concentration tested over the study period (3
replicates x 2 runs x 3 operators x 5 days x 3 sites). Each operator ran one set of external
controls (i.e., positive control and negative control) on their assigned instrument prior to
testing reproducibility samples daily.
The results are summarized below in Table 4 and 5. No significant differences between sites,
or between operators were observed.

Wet Testing
Cross-Reactivity was evaluated for the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test on the DASH
Instrument by wet testing of 50 different viruses, bacteria, and fungi that could potentially
interfere with the assay targets. All samples were prepared in simulated clinical nasal matrix
and tested individually, without the presence of the test viral targets. The testing
concentrations for potentially interfering microorganisms were ≥105 units/mL for viruses and
≥106 units/mL for other microorganisms, unless otherwise noted in the table below.
None of the evaluated organisms demonstrated cross-reactivity with the assay at the tested
concentrations as shown in the table below.

In silico
In silico cross-reactivity of the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test was explored by
evaluating genomes representing the viral, bacterial, and fungal organisms in the wet testing
cross-reactivity study (see table above). 10% of complete genomes of these microorganisms
were randomly selected and downloaded from GenBank to be included in this analysis. Any
microorganism showing >80% homology to a single primer, probe, or capture
oligonucleotide was further evaluated for homology for the other target primers and probes
for amplification. DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test’s forward and reverse primers for the
SARS-CoV-2 target exhibited >80% homology to SARS-coronavirus Tor2 isolate and
therefore may be amplified but will not be detected due to inability of the test target probes to
bind. Performance of DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test with SARS-coronavirus Tor2 has
not been confirmed by wet testing analysis.
b) Microbial Interference Study
Microbial Interference was evaluated for the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test on the
DASH Instrument by wet testing over 50 different viruses, bacteria, and fungi that are
common causes of respiratory infections. All samples were prepared in simulated clinical
nasal matrix and tested with individual microorganisms or with pooled groups of up to four
microorganisms in the presence of the test viral targets, SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and
influenza B, co-spiked at 3x LoD. Microbial non-interference was determined if the target
had a 100% positive call rate for all three replicates tested (3/3).
None of the evaluated microorganisms demonstrated interference with the assay at the tested
concentrations as shown in the table below.

c) Competitive Interference Study
The impact of competitive interference, caused by co-infections with on-target analytes, was
evaluated for the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test on the DASH Instrument by testing
contrived samples consisting of individual SARS-CoV-2, Flu A or Flu B strains at high
concentrations in the presence of the other two target strains at 3x LoD. For this study,
competitive interference was assessed using one strain each of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A
and influenza B. Testing for each target strain (at 3x LoD concentration) and each potential
competitive strain (at high concentration) was performed in triplicate. No competitive
interference was observed if all replicates for the low concentration (3x LoD) target yielded
positive results.
The study showed that SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations >1.41E+06 copies/mL inhibited
detection of Flu A at 3x LoD, and at SARS-CoV-2 concentrations of >5.65E+06 copies/mL
inhibited detection of Flu B at 3x LoD. Flu A at concentration of 1.38E+06 TCID /mL
50
inhibited detection of Flu B at 3x LoD. In addition, Flu B at concentrations above 1.01E+03
TCID /mL inhibited detection of both SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A at 3x LoD. The highest
50
coinfection concentration of the competing virus, where the remaining two targets are
detected for three replicates at 3x LoD, are reported in the table below.

d) Exogenous/Endogenous Interfering Substances
The potential for interference for the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test was evaluated
with substances that may be present in respiratory specimens. A total of 22 potentially
interfering endogenous and exogenous substances were tested at or above clinically relevant
levels in simulated clinical nasal matrix co-spiked at ~3x LoD with SARS-CoV-2, Flu A and
Flu B inactivated viral particles. Each sample was tested in triplicate. The FluMist nasal
vaccine was not tested.
Two of the substances tested in the study, Biotin (vitamin B-7) at 4.58 µg/mL and Flonase
(active ingredient Fluticasone Propionate) at 5% (v/v) gave false negative results with SARS-
CoV-2 target. Additional testing at lower test substance concentrations were performed to
determine the concentration where interference is no longer observed. No interference was
observed for any of the substances tested at the concentrations noted in the table below.

4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a) External Controls
The DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Positive Control and DASH Negative Control swabs
are available separately for use as external controls. Please refer to Instrument Description
Information (Section C.5) above for assay controls. A study was conducted to evaluate these
external controls with DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test. A total of 45 DASH SARS-
CoV-2 & Flu A/B Positive Control and 45 DASH Negative Control swabs were tested daily
by nine untrained operators at three CLIA-Waived sites across five testing days. Three lots of
external controls were distributed evenly across all the three sites. All 45 external positive
controls and all 45 external negative controls yielded accurate results.
b) Sample Stability
A study was conducted to determine the specimen stability on the swab after collection and
prior to testing with the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test on the DASH Instrument.
Specimens included SARS-CoV-2, Flu A and Flu B, co-spiked in pooled negative nasal
matrix at a concentration of 2x LoD. Twenty replicates of the positive samples were tested
fresh (T0) and after storage at multiple time points (5, 10, 25, 30 and 40 minutes) at room
temperature. Negative samples were also included and were tested in three replicates for each
storage condition. Results indicated that positive samples remained stable, and all targets
were detected up to twenty-five minutes after collection and storage at room temperature.
Negative samples tested correctly for each timepoint.
Per test labeling, patient samples should be tested immediately after collection for optimal
test performance.
c) Matrix Equivalency
The objective of this study was to establish equivalent performance of the DASH SARS-
CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test on the DASH Instrument between the two matrices used in the
analytical studies: clinical pooled nasal matrix (PNM) and simulated clinical nasal matrix
(SCNM). SCNM was formulated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with glycerol and
mucin, added to mimic the nasal cavity fluid. For this study, SARS-CoV-2 (Isolate hCoV-
19/USA/GAEHC-2811C/2021), Flu A (A/Victoria/2570/2019) and Flu B (B/Utah/9/2014)
were co-spiked in both matrices at 2x and 5x LoD. Aliquots of negative matrices were also
included in the evaluation. For both matrices, ten replicates of the negative samples, 40
replicates of the samples prepared at 2x LoD and ten replicates of the samples prepared at 5x
LoD were tested. The acceptance criteria to demonstrate equivalency was ≥95% detection for

6. Detection Limit:
Limit of detection (LoD) of the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test on the DASH Rapid
PCR Instrument was determined utilizing five viral strains representing the test targets. All
samples were prepared in pooled negative nasal matrix. Initially, three-fold serial dilutions of
each strain in pooled negative nasal matrix were prepared and tested in replicates of four to
find the lowest level detectable by the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test. The final LoD,
a concentration producing 95% positivity, was confirmed by testing twenty replicates of each
of the strains at the selected preliminary LoD. The final LoD results are summarized in the
tables below.

7. Inclusivity (Analytical Reactivity):
Wet Testing
The inclusivity of the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test on the DASH Instrument was
evaluated by testing seven strains of SARS-CoV-2, 21 strains of Flu A, and 10 strains of Flu
B. Positive samples were contrived by spiking each virus strain, individually, into negative
pooled nasal matrix at concentrations of ~3x LoD and testing in triplicate in a blinded
fashion. Inclusivity was determined if the target had a 100% detection (3/3) for all three
replicates tested. If less than 100% detection was observed, the strain was prepared at a
higher concentration and tested until 100% detection was achieved. The strains evaluated and
the lowest concentration that met the inclusivity criteria outlined above are shown in the table
below.

In silico
The inclusivity of the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test was also evaluated using in silico
analysis of the sample preparation capture oligonucleotides and the PCR primers and probes
for SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A and B in relation to sequences available in the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus database. Genomic
sequences for SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the NCBI on May 8, 2024, and included all
lineages and variants of concern (VOC) or variants of interest (VOI). The influenza genomic
sequences were retrieved from the NCBI on May 13, 2024. Flu A sequences were limited to
subtypes H1N1 (excluding Swine flu) and H3N2, based upon completeness. Flu B sequences
were required to be full-length, with no subtype limitations applied. All genomic sequences
containing ambiguous nucleotides were excluded from the analysis.

The query oligonucleotides for the specific virus target were aligned to the filtered sets of
viral genome sequences using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) program, where any
difference would be a mismatch or an insertion/deletion. The genomic sequences were
ranked according to the number of capture oligonucleotides and PCR primers and probes
containing zero, one, and two or more mismatches. Melting temperature (Tm) analysis was
performed for any oligonucleotide:genome pairing that contained a mismatch, and the
pairings that passed the Tm analysis criteria were combined with pairings containing no
mismatches, then grouped into amplifiable sets. The resulting oligonucleotide:genome
pairings were counted to determine the number of sequences predicted to be captured and, if
captured, predicted to be detected by the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test. The results of
this predicted-to-detect analysis are summarized in the table below:
Table 13: Sequences Predicted by In Silico Analysis to Be Detected by DASH SARS-
CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test
Target Sequences Predicted to be Detected
Flu A
≥99.97% (18112 of 18117 sequences analyzed)
(Subtypes H1N1 and H3N2)
Flu B ≥98.27% (8136 of 8279 sequences analyzed)
SARS-CoV-2 ≥99.99% (994778 of 994846 sequences analyzed)
Based on the analysis, 99.99% (994778/994846) of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, 99.97%
(18112/18117) of influenza A subtype H1N1 and H3N2 sequences and 98.3% (8136/8279)
of influenza B sequences are expected to be detected by the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B
Test.
Inclusivity Information for Non-Seasonal Influenza A Subtypes (in silico Analysis)
DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test in silico inclusivity analysis was performed by aligning
with sequences corresponding to the gene target in Flu A subtype H5N3 and H7N7
sequences downloaded from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data).
Reactivity was predicted based on the number and location of the mismatches in the targeted
region. The results of the BLAST analysis demonstrated that the subtype H5N3 and H7N7 of
Flu A are expected to be detected by DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test. Wet testing for
H5N3 strain of Flu A was also performed, confirming inclusivity of DASH SARS-CoV-2 &
Flu A/B Test with the H5N3 strain of Flu A (see Table 12 above). The Flu A H7N7 strain
was not available for wet testing confirmation.
Additional Flu A in silico inclusivity analysis was performed for Flu A subtypes available
from the GISAID database from November 5, 2023 to November 5, 2024 that have infected
humans. In this analysis, all possible combinations of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase were
considered, and all available sequences were required to contain the Flu A target region,
found in humans, and to be full-length as reported by the submitters. All sequences
containing ambiguous nucleotides were excluded from the analysis. Based on these criteria, a
total of 37 sequences including subtype H5N1 (26), H5N6 (3), H9N2 (6), H10N3 (1), and
H10N5 (1) were analyzed in the study. The resulting oligonucleotide:genome pairings were
counted to determine the number of sequences predicted to be captured and, if captured,
predicted to be detected by the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test. Based on in silico

inclusivity analysis of the Flu A capture oligonucleotides and PCR primers and probes, it is
predicted that the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test will detect 97.3% (36/37) of all
human host Flu A sequences collected between November 5, 2023 and November 5 2024.
The performance characteristics of DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test with these Flu A
subtypes have not been confirmed by wet testing analysis.
8. Assay Cut-Off:
The DASH Rapid PCR Instrument has four fluorescence detectors also known as channels
and an algorithm that is utilized for detection of the targets. The DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu
A/B Test does not have a simple Ct or Cq threshold below which the target is ‘Detected’, and
above which ‘Not Detected’. The Cq threshold for the test is 40, same as the total number of
PCR cycles. If Cq is >40, then the target is always ‘Not Detected’.
9. Carry-Over:
An analytical study was performed to assess potential carryover or cross-contamination in the
DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test by testing high positive and negative samples in an
alternating fashion on the DASH Instrument. The high positive samples consisted of a single
viral target (either SARS-CoV-2, Flu A or Flu B), prepared by spiking the viral target at
≥1x105 copies/mL or ≥1x105 TCID /mL in simulated clinical nasal matrix. The study
50
utilized eight viral strains representing the test targets (two strains of SARS-CoV-2, and three
strains each of Flu A and Flu B).
Samples were tested across five DASH Instruments, where one positive sample was followed
by one negative sample. The process was repeated eight times to cover two strains of SARS-
CoV-2, and three strains each of Flu A and Flu B. In total, 40 high positive and 40 negative
samples were evaluated. All high positive samples yielded positive results for the viral
targets in the sample, while all negative samples were negative. These results confirm that
there is no evidence of carryover from samples tested with the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu
A/B Test on the DASH Rapid PCR Instrument.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Refer to the ‘Clinical Studies’ section of this document.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Performance:
The clinical performance of the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test on DASH Instrument
was established in a multi-center study conducted with anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens
collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. Specimens were
prospectively collected (i.e., all comers between two time points that met the clinical study
inclusion criteria) from January and March 2024. Seven geographically diverse CLIA-
waived testing sites within the United States participated in the study. Informed consent was
obtained for all patients prior to testing. AN swabs for comparator testing were collected by
K241652 - Page 23 of 25

--- Page 24 ---
the healthcare provider from both sides of the nose and placed into transport media for
comparator testing. For testing with the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test, AN swabs
from both sides of the nose were either healthcare provider-collected or adult-collected from
individuals below 14 years, or self-collected from individuals aged 14 years or older. The
order of swab collection was alternated between the comparator swab and the DASH SARS-
CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test. Performance of the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test was
assessed by a comparison of results with an FDA cleared RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, and
a second FDA cleared test for Flu A and Flu B (expressed as positive percent agreement
(PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA)). All discordant results between the DASH
SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test and the comparator were investigated using a third highly
sensitive FDA cleared test and are footnoted under the Performance table below.
A total of 819 subjects were enrolled in the study from the seven clinical sites. Of these, two
subjects were later found ineligible for enrollment. Of the remaining 817 enrolled subjects,
22 were excluded due to protocol deviations (e.g., specimen shipping issues, comparator
sample being unable to be tested within the stability window of the test IFU, etc.), leaving
795 evaluable specimens to be included in the calculations of estimates of assay
performance. Of those, additional three specimens were deemed unevaluable for Flu A and B
due to unavailability of comparator test results. In total, 795 specimens were included in the
calculations of performance for SARS-CoV-2, and 792 specimens for calculations of
performance for Flu A and Flu B when tested on the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test.
Of the 833 samples tested on DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test, including 16 repeat
samples, there were 24 instances of invalid results (2.9%; 95% CI: 1.9% - 4.3%). The clinical
performance of the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test is summarized in the table below.
