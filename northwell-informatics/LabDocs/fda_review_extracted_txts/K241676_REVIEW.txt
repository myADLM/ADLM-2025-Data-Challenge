C Type of Test:
Quantitative reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qRT-LAMP)
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The TriVerity test is an automated, semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic test that measures the
relative expression levels of host response genes in RNA isolated from whole blood collected in
the PAXgene Blood RNA tube using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (RT-LAMP) on the Myrna instrument.
The TriVerity test is indicated for use in conjunction with clinical assessments and other
laboratory findings as an aid to differentiate bacterial infections, viral infections, and non-
infectious illness, as well as to determine the likelihood of 7-day need for mechanical ventilation,
vasopressors, and/or renal replacement therapy in adult patients with suspected acute infection or
suspected sepsis presenting to the emergency department.
The test generates three scores that each fall within one of five discrete interpretation bands
based on the increasing likelihood of
1) bacterial infection,
2) viral infection, and
3) severe illness, as defined by the need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and/or renal
replacement therapy (RRT) within seven days.
Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
C Special Instrument Requirements:
For use with the Myrna Instrument
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The TriVerity test is an in-vitro diagnostic device that uses reverse transcription loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to measures the relative expression levels of 29 host
response genes and 3 housekeeping transcripts (Table 1) from whole blood samples collected in
PAXgene blood collection tubes (K042613). The assay includes single-use, disposable TriVerity
Cartridges which contain all the reagents necessary to perform a single test. The TriVerity test is

processed on the Myrna instrument and includes built-in software integrated with the TriVerity
computational algorithm to generate a result for each sample in approximately 30 minutes.

B Principle of Operation:
The TriVerity test is composed of the TriVerity Cartridge that is run on the Myrna Instrument.
The Myrna Instrument is a cartridge-based, molecular diagnostic instrument designed to measure
relative gene expression. The single-use TriVerity Cartridge contains all the necessary reagents
to perform RNA isolation from the sample and analysis. The PAXgene Blood RNA Tube is
directly docked to the cartridge by the user before the cartridge is loaded into the instrument.
Approximately 550 μL of blood and PAXgene solution is drawn into the cartridge from the tube.
Nucleic acid extraction and purification are completed on-board using standard solid phase
reversible immobilization (SPRI) chemistry facilitated by magnetic particles. Purified RNA is
eluted and then mixed with master mix reagents, and then is channeled to separate reaction
vessels. The Myrna Instrument’s analyzer/detector is an incubator designed for isothermal
amplification with single color fluorescence detection capability. The quantitative gene
expression assay is based on real-time generation of fluorescence from an intercalating dye
which increases its fluorescence signal due to the increasing abundance of double stranded DNA
generated during amplification. Each singleplex reaction is performed in a 2 μL reaction volume.
The test simultaneously runs 64 isothermal amplification reactions. The test uses a multiplex
array which contains primers to measure, in duplicate, 29 mRNA host response transcripts, 3
housekeeping transcripts, and 2 process controls. The housekeeping genes are used together with
process controls to normalize input RNA, while the ‘host response genes’ are inputs to the two
fixed classifiers that generate the assay results: IMX-BVN-4 (bacterial-viral-noninfected) and
IMX-SEV-4 (illness severity). The IMX-BVN-4 classifier estimates of the likelihood of a
bacterial or a viral infection and the IMX-SEV-4 classifier estimates the risk of severe illness as
defined by the 7-day need for vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and/or renal replacement
therapy.
For each patient sample, the TriVerity test will generate three numerical results which indicate
the likelihood of a bacterial infection, the likelihood of a viral infection, and the likelihood of
severe illness. For each numerical result, there will also be an interpretation provided that is

related to the specific risk band within which the quantitative number falls (corresponding to
Very High, High, Moderate, Low, and Very Low).
The TriVerity Cartridge is designed to dock the PAXgene venipuncture tube directly to avoid
potential issues (including use error, contamination, and biohazards) in transferring samples from
one vessel to another. The pre-analytical steps are designed to be simple and consist of tube
inversion, insertion of the tube into the cartridge, and insertion of the cartridge into the device,
with an estimated hands-on time of less than one minute.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Myrna Instrument
2. Specimen Identification:
The instrument software reads a unique barcode on the assay cartridge to identify the
cartridge type, the cartridge assay, the cartridge lot/expiration details, and lot-to-lot
correction factors. This unique cartridge barcode is linked to the sample ID through scanning
or manual entry. The cartridge barcode also includes traceability information including the
cartridge manufacture date and expiration dates.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A medical professional is required for collecting the whole blood sample by venipuncture
using the PAXgene blood collection tubes within the PAXgene Blood RNA System
(K042613). The user then mixes the sample by inversion followed by loading the tube
directly into the cartridge and then inserting the cartridge into the Myrna instrument. All
waste and amplified material remain sealed within the TriVerity Cartridge after the test is
performed.
4. Calibration:
All necessary configuration, qualification, and calibration (where applicable) is performed by
Inflammatix including calibration of the TriVerity cartridges. Further configuration and
calibration procedures are not required by the operator.
5. Quality Control:
Each cartridge contains two internal process controls for monitoring amplification inhibition,
assay reagents, and sample processing effectiveness. The controls are RNA spike in controls
from the External RNA Controls Consortium. External controls are not provided with the
assay, but may be used in accordance with local, state, and federal accrediting organizations,
as applicable.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A multi-site reproducibility study was performed across three laboratories. The
measurements were performed over five non-consecutive days. At each site, at least two
operators conducted the tests on three different instruments using one cartridge lot/panel for a
total of 90 runs per panel member.
The ‘infectious’ specimens were designed as contrived specimens. The samples were
formulated, aliquoted (1.6 mL) then frozen at -80°C. Prior to initiation of the reproducibility
study, the aliquots were sent on dry ice to the participating laboratories. Each aliquot was
thawed at room temperature for up to 120 mins or until completely thawed. After thawing,
PAXgene RNA Blood contrived samples were homogenized by inverting 10 times and
immediately run on the Myrna instrument. The following panel members were utilized for
the reproducibility study:

Results from the reproducibility study are summarized in the table below including between-
days, instruments, and sites. Results met the pre-specified acceptance criteria of the standard
deviation (SD) for the evaluated interpretation band being less than 5.50 score units, which
reflects a small probability of scores falling into nonadjacent bands. The TriVerity scores are
on a logistic scale and therefore CV analysis was not considered for these parameters;
however, SD and %CV for the reproducibility study were included in Table 4 for the 29 host
response genes and two housekeeping genes.

2. Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility:
To evaluate variance of the TriVerity scores between cartridge lots a lot-to-lot reproducibility
study was conducted using the four panel members. Samples were tested by one operator at
one site on four separate instruments using three cartridges lots. For each run, cartridge lots
were alternated resulting in a total of six replicates per lot for each panel member for a total
of 18 samples per panel member. Results from the lot variability study, included in Table 6
below, were acceptable and met the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

An additional study was performed to assess the TriVerity device measurements across the
score ranges not fully evaluated with contrived samples during the reproducibility study.
Clinical samples that covered all score types were evaluated with at least 20 results in every
score band. Each sample was tested in duplicate with the same instrument and cartridge lot.
The study was performed over five days using a total of three different cartridge lots and 12
different instruments. The SD measured in each band score type was less than 5.50 score
units, meeting the pre-defined acceptance criteria for repeatability.
3. Linearity:
Linearity is not applicable to the TriVerity test score. To ensure that the markers that are used
to generate the score are being detected quantitatively within the linear range a linearity study

was performed for the gene expression of the individual markers. Using serial dilutions
prepared with pure in vitro transcribed RNA sequences which contained each of the 32
markers measured by the TriVerity test, six dilutions, ranging from 5x109 copies/mL to
5x105 copies/mL, were prepared in an RNA stabilizing solution and measured in duplicate.
The study was performed in a single laboratory, on a single day using one instrument. The
data showed linearity, for the analytical measuring range of 1x109 copies/mL to 1x106
copies/mL, and device results met the acceptance criteria of a 5% allowable deviation from
linearity for each of the 32 assay markers.
4. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity
Non-specific amplification from genomic DNA (20 ng/µL of gDNA added to RNA
stabilization buffer) as well as from a no-template control (NTC) was evaluated. Both the
NTC and the human genomic DNA showed no amplification signal. Separately, cross-
reactivity was assessed by spiking 10 ng/µL of gDNA into the two contrived panel members
B and C then comparing the results to un-spiked samples. Results demonstrated no
significant bias or imprecision when compared with control conditions at the tested
concentrations. The mean drift between the control and test samples was <5.50 score units
and the difference in standard deviation for each results band was also <5.50 score units.
Interference
An interference study was performed to evaluate the impact of select endogenous and
exogenous interferents on the ability of the assay to detect the 32 genes in the TriVerity test,
specifically the impact of those substances on score results. Interferents were appropriately
prepared, then spiked into each of the two panel members B (Very High Bacterial
Score/Very Low Viral Score/Very High Severity Score) and C (Very Low Bacterial
Score/Very High Viral Score/Very Low Severity Score), at concentrations higher than the
normal or expected reference ranges. Four replicates per panel were tested at each
concentration of potential interferent using two cartridge lots. Interference was assessed by
estimating the bias for each specimen when compared to an un-spiked control (containing no
interferent and the appropriate solvent, when applicable). The substances tested,
concentration of each, and results are listed below in Table 7.

A specimen stability study was conducted to support the recommended handling conditions
from blood collection with PAXgene sample tubes to testing on the TriVerity Cartridge.
Blood samples were collected from 15 healthy donors with the first sample processed within
one hour of collection, then tested in duplicate after a 2-hour, 12-hour, and 14-hour
incubation at room temperature (15°C and 25°C). Results from the stability study were not
statistically significant and demonstrated a standard deviation less than 5.50 score units in the
TriVerity Severity score when evaluated after 12-hour or 14-hour storage compared to time
0. This acceptance criteria ensures that less than 2.5% of the observed scores fell into a non-
adjacent reporting bin, which would change the clinical interpretation. These data support the
recommended handling claims that samples can be stored at room temperature up to 12 hours
after collection.
Freeze-thaw Stability Study
To support the use of banked frozen samples in the clinical validation studies an additional
study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between fresh and frozen specimens. At
total of 60 whole blood specimens collected in PAXgene sample tubes were tested.
Following incubation at room temperature, specimens were stored for 24 hrs. at -80°C then
underwent one freeze thaw cycle. TriVerity results were compared to results from the same
sample that was tested within one hour of collection. Across all evaluated samples, the mean
Viral and Severity TriVerity score shifts were not statistically significant. The mean shift for
the Bacterial score was significant; however, the shift was less than 5.50 score units.
Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that a single freeze-thaw cycle did not significantly
affect the TriVerity reported results.
Real-time Stability
Real-time reagent stability studies are ongoing to support product claims of room
temperature storage for 12 months. Testing will be performed on three cartridge lots when
stored at 15-30°C for up to 18 months. Stability testing for one month demonstrated no
significant change in performance for any of the three TriVerity scores.
Shipping Stability
Shipping studies were conducted for both the TriVerity cartridges and the Myrna instrument.
For the Myrna instrument, control samples were tested prior to ship testing. The instrument
in its packaging was then subjected to distribution cycle 13 at assurance level II as defined in
ASTM D4169:23. A second set of samples were tested and compared to the control samples.
Standard deviation in Bacterial, Viral, and Severity scores of post ship test runs were < 5.50
score units.
Sixty (60) cartridges underwent ship testing and more than 30 cartridges were tested after
conditioning and ship testing. The cartridges were pre-conditioned per ASTM F2825-18 then
subjected to simulated ship testing per ASTM D4169:23, distribution cycle 13 with assurance
level II. The cartridges and packaging passed all post ship test inspections. A contrived
sample panel was tested. Standard deviation in Bacterial, Viral, and Severity scores of post
ship test runs were < 5.50 score units. There was no impact on cartridge or instrument
performance after testing.

7. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank
Leukoreduced blood was used to determine the Limit of Blank. Ten replicates of the
leukocyte reduced blood did not generate a valid TriVerity test score for any score type.
Limit of Detection
To determine the Limit of Detection, an RNA stabilizing solution was spiked with serial
dilutions of the transcribed RNA IVT mix. From testing 20 replicates of concentrations
ranging from 1x106 copies/mL to 1x105 copies/mL, the analytical sensitivity was determined
to be 1x106 copies/mL, which was the lowest concentration at which 95% (19/20) of the
replicates for each individual marker tested demonstrated measurable amplification.
Limit of Quantitation
Two clinical pools were prepared: a Viral pool (Low Bacterial/High Viral/ Low Severity)
and a Bacterial/Severe pool (High Bacterial/Low Viral/ High Severity). Samples were then
serially diluted in leukoreduced blood. The Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) for each pool was
defined as the lowest WBC concentration at which 95% (19/20) of the replicates provided a
score with a standard deviation less than 5.50 score units for all 3 score types. The overall
LOQ was defined as the higher of the LOQs calculated for each sample pool. Samples were
tested with two cartridge lots across multiple days, instruments, and sample types, for a total
of 220 runs. Results indicated that the higher LoQ was approximately 500 WBC cells/µL for
both sample pools.
8. Assay Cut-Off:
There are three score types (Bacterial, Viral, and Severity) with five interpretation bands
(Very High, High, Moderate, Low, Very Low). Cut-offs were defined ahead of the clinical
validation study, and the assay performance was evaluated in the clinical study using those
pre-defined cutoffs as compared to adjudicated results.
9. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not applicable.
10. Carry-Over:
A study was performed to evaluate the risk of carry-over or amplicon contamination between
runs tested on the Myrna instrument. Carry-over was assessed by alternating testing between
panel members B (Very High Bacterial Score/Very Low Viral Score/Very High Severity
Score), C (Very Low Bacterial Score/Very High Viral Score/Very Low Severity Score), and
F (Very Low Bacterial Score/Very Low Viral Score/Very Low Severity Score). A total of 60
samples were tested over two days using three instruments, with 10 runs per instrument per
day, as shown below:

Within-run standard deviation was <5.50 for all tested samples, panel members B, C and F
for each sample score result (Bacterial, Viral, and Severity). Overall standard deviation for
all runs and instruments was also <5.50. Results, presented in Table 8 below, indicate that the
carry-over results are acceptable.

interventional study (SEPSIS-SHIELD, Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04094818)
conducted across 22 sites comprised of emergency departments (EDs) and academic
hospitals in the United States and Europe. Patients were enrolled and samples collected
during two sequential phases: a frozen phase where samples were banked for testing and a
fresh phase where samples were collected and tested prospectively. A fresh versus frozen
study was conducted and demonstrated comparable results, allowing for data to be pooled
during analysis. There were two primary objectives, the first was to establish the diagnostic
performance for differentiating bacterial from viral infection in adult patients with suspected
acute infection (infection and at least one abnormal vital sign) or suspected sepsis (defined by
a blood culture order and at least two abnormal vital signs). The second primary objective
was to establish the prognostic performance for predicting severe illness in patients with
suspected acute infection or sepsis. Illness severity was defined by clinical outcomes (i.e.,
whether a patient received mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and/or renal replacement
therapy [RRT] within 7 days of enrollment).
For the first primary objective, diagnostic performance of the TriVerity test for identifying
bacterial or viral infection was compared to physician adjudication. Medical experts
independently reviewed all available clinical data collected during standard of care as well as
data collected as part of the study protocol, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and
procalcitonin (PCT) values, while remaining blinded to the TriVerity test results. Two
independent analyses were conducted based on the clinical adjudication results:
1. Forced Evaluation – To define the ground truth, forced adjudication was used as the
comparator method where physicians were forced to make a bacterial or viral diagnosis
(certain [Yes or No] or uncertain [Probable or Unlikely] infection status). The primary
diagnostic performance evaluation of the device was based on the Forced Endpoint.
2. Consensus Evaluation – Consensus expert adjudication was used as a comparator method
in which uncertain (Probable or Unlikely) cases were removed. Although data from these

--- Page 18 ---
analyses are presented, the consensus adjudication should be considered supplementary
information.
For the second primary objective, all enrolled participants followed through the first seven
days were eligible for inclusion if information was available on the presence of severe
illness. For a patient to be evaluated the use of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use,
and/or RRT had to be associated with the acute episode of care in the ED but not chronic
exposure (e.g., continuation of home care or short-term use around surgical or other
procedures).
Patient demographics and medical history for the study population was comparable across all
analyzed subgroups (forced evaluation, consensus evaluation, and severity prognosis). The
forced evaluation endpoint population was comprised of 1,222 patients (289 prospectively
recruited and 933 banked frozen samples). The mean age was 50.9 years with 49.5% female.
The race and ethnicity representation were as follows: Hispanic/Latino 11.0%, Asian 0.9%,
Black or African American 29.5%, and White 64.3%. Out of the 1,222 patients enrolled in
the forced adjudication cohort, a total of 1,120 individuals were also included in the severity
prognostic endpoint population (262 prospectively recruited and 858 banked frozen samples).
The mean age for the severity prognostic cohort was 51.3 years with 48.6% of enrolled
individuals identified as female. Race and ethnicity showed similar levels of distribution as
the diagnostic population (Hispanic/Latino 11.4%, Asian 0.7%, Black or African American
28.7%, and White 65.5%). Metabolic/endocrinological, respiratory tract, and cardiovascular
illnesses were the most frequently represented disorders across all study populations.
Malignancies were the most frequent type of immunosuppression, reported in approximately
10% of all study participants, followed by solid organ transplantation, steroid treatment, and
HIV/AIDS. A total of 219 (17.9%) participants in the diagnostic population were
immunosuppressed; among these, 30 fell into more than one of the immunosuppression
categories. A total of 206 (18.4%) participants in the severity prognosis population were
immunosuppressed. Among these, 30 participants fell into more than one
immunosuppression category. Vital signs at time of enrollment showed that most patients
had heart beats > 90 beats/minute while altered mental status was observed in 4.7 – 5.1% of
patients. A summary of the demographic data and other clinical characteristics are provided
in Table 9 below.

The disease prevalence (pre-test probability), predictive values (post-test probability),
likelihood ratios (with 80% confidence intervals calculated by bootstrap analysis), and the
frequency of results for each score type and interpretation band generated by the of the
TriVerity test are presented below for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections in
addition to prognosis of illness severity. The likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated using the
definition where LR equals the probability that an individual with disease has the test result
divided by the probability that an individual without disease has the test result. This formula
was applied to each interpretation band separately. Predictive values depend on the
likelihood ratios and the prevalence of disease.
Clinical Performance Evaluation for Primary Diagnostic Endpoint – Bacterial Score
Results for the performance of the TriVerity device for diagnosing the likelihood of bacterial
infection showed a monotonic increase with no overlapping of the 80% CIs between non-
adjacent interpretation bands. This demonstrates a relationship between the TriVerity
Bacterial score and the increasing likelihood of bacterial infection across each interpretation
band. For the forced adjudicated population, 80.4% of the results fell into the clinically
actionable Very High, High, Low or Very Low interpretation bands (40.8% Very High and
High, 39.6% Very Low and Low interpretation bands); only 19.6% of results were found in
the moderate interpretation band which had a LR of 0.9. At a prevalence of 60.6% for
bacterial infections, the positive predictive values of the outer Very High and Very Low
interpretation bands were 89.0% and 20.0%, respectively. Forced and consensus diagnostic
results were similar; however, consensus adjudicated results performed better due to the
removal of uncertain bacterial infection status. Results from the forced adjudication are
included in Table 11 and results from the consensus adjudication are included in Table 12.

Clinical Performance Evaluation for Prognostic Endpoint – Illness Severity Score
Table 15 shows the performance of the TriVerity test for the prediction of illness severity as
defined by the need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and/or RRT within 7 days. The
Severity score demonstrated a monotonic increase between bands with no overlapping of the
80% CIs between non-adjacent interpretation bands. A total of 79.6% of results were
observed in the clinically actionable Very High, High, Very Low and Low interpretation
bands; 18.8% of these in the Very High and High bands, 60.7% in the Low and Very Low
bands. At a prevalence of 10.9%, the probabilities of having severe illness were 58.1% and
2.7% for the Very High and Very Low interpretation bands. The data demonstrated a
relationship between the TriVerity test results and the likelihood of needing mechanical
ventilation, vasopressors, and/or RRT within 7 days.

medical history, including race/ethnicity, immunocompromised status, SARS-CoV-2
infection, as well as by enrollment criteria (suspected acute infection versus suspected
sepsis).
For subgroups with a sufficient number of patients for statistical analysis, an increase in
TriVerity scores appeared to correspond to an increase in likelihood for diagnosing bacterial
and viral infections.
Performance by Race and Ethnicity
Substantial differences were not observed in the diagnostic performance of the TriVerity test
between Black/African Americans and other races or between ethnicities (Hispanic or Latino
versus Not Hispanic or Latino) using forced adjudication. AUROCs for the accuracy of the
bacterial results of the TriVerity test among White, Black/African American vs. participants
of other races were 0.76, 0.76 and 0.84, respectively. AUROCs for the viral results were
0.81, 0.83 and 0.90, respectively.
For the illness severity prognosis endpoint, race did not impact the performance of Severity
result readout of the TriVerity test. Across a diverse cohort of participants enrolled, LRs for
the five interpretation bands in the TriVerity test did not differ markedly between
Black/African Americans and White patients or between Hispanic or Latino and Non-
Hispanic or Latino patients. The number of Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander patients was not sufficient to evaluate potential
differences individually. AUROCs for the TriVerity illness severity results were 0.79 for
Black/African Americans versus 0.78 for other races.

Performance by Immune Competency Status
Additional analyses were conducted to determine whether the presence of
immunosuppression in study participants affected the performance of the TriVerity test.
Likelihood ratios and AUROCs for the Bacterial and Viral TriVerity results in the forced
adjudicated population did not differ markedly based on participants with (N = 219) or
without immunosuppression (N = 1,003). Results are presented below in Tables 36 – 38.
Likelihood ratios ranged from 0.1 to 20.3 in immunosuppressed participants and ranged from
0.2 to 20.0 in immunocompetent participants across all three score types.

Performance by enrollment criteria (suspected of acute infection versus suspected sepsis)
Additional analyses were performed to identify whether performance of the TriVerity test
differed among different enrollment cohorts (i.e., individuals with suspected acute infection
and at least 1 abnormal vital sign vs. individuals with suspected sepsis with at least 2
abnormal vital signs). Analysis of TriVerity Bacterial Score results (Table 39) and Viral
Score (Table 39) test results are summarized below. Among the forced adjudication cohort of
patients, LRs ranged from 0.2 in the Very Low to 5.4 in the Very High TriVerity Bacterial
bands for participants enrolled with suspected acute infection with ≥1 vital sign change.
Among participants with suspected sepsis with ≥2 vital sign changes, the likelihood ratios
ranged from 0.1 to 4.9. LRs for the Viral TriVerity interpretation bands also did not differ
markedly between participants enrolled under either of the two inclusion criteria. AUROCs
for the Bacterial TriVerity results were 0.81 and 0.72 in participants with suspected acute
infection with ≥1 vital sign change vs. suspected sepsis with ≥2 vital sign change. Similarly,
AUROCs for the viral TriVerity results were 0.83 and 0.83 for participants with a suspected
infection plus ≥1 vital sign change vs. suspected sepsis with ≥2 vital sign. These results
demonstrate that the inclusion criteria used at the time of enrollment did not impact the
performance of TriVerity Bacterial and Viral results. Table 41 outlines the prognostic
severity results. AUROC for TriVerity severity results in the population with suspected acute
Infection with ≥1 vital sign change was 0.84 and was 0.72 for the suspected sepsis with ≥2
vital signs change population.

Performance by Viral Respiratory Infection
To assess whether the TriVerity Viral score could adequately identify SARS-COV-2
infections, additional subgroup analysis was performed in enrolled individuals who tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Due to the lack of a control group (patients tested
and negative for SARS-CoV-2) performance for this population could not be independently
assess based on the LRs. However, most patients were assigned to either the Very High,
High, or Moderate likelihood interpretation bands. A limitation statement has been included
in the labeling that this test is not meant to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Numbers for influenza A and B infections (N = 27) were too low to present as a separate
analysis (reflecting the epidemiology of viral diseases in the US during the study phases). A
limitation statement has been included in the labeling that this test is not meant to diagnose
influenza.
D Clinical Cut-Off:
Following training of the TriVerity classifier, thresholds between the interpretation bands for
each result were set based on data collected on the cartridge. Cut-off values for the TriVerity test
were established prior to the clinical trial. Samples used for setting the thresholds (n = 399) were
collected from single site and multicenter Emergency Departments and ICUs that were
independent from the pivotal clinical study. Thresholds were optimized using the procedure
outlined below:

• Set initial threshold targeting 95% Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) in band 1 (very low
likelihood), 95% Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) in band 5 (very high likelihood),
and 10% moderate band coverage on each axis (bacterial, viral, illness severity)
• For each score, examine band 1/5 fraction (i.e., percentage of results in bands 1 and 5
combined) and consider relaxing initial thresholds between bands 1 and 2 and between
bands 4 and 5 to ensure maximal outer coverage. This was noted as minor reductions in
PPA or NPA below 95% may give significant increases in outer band coverage, which in
turn may provide greater benefit to more patients.
• Examine and adjust for monotonicity, aiming for roughly likelihood ratios 0.3-0.5 in
band 2, roughly 0.9-1.2 in band 3, and 1.8-2.5 in band 4, to ensure clear gradations of
separability.
• Examine standard deviation per band, ensuring none is substantially greater than 4.5 and
adjust thresholds if necessary.
• Globally re-examine all metrics (PPA/NPA in outer bands; band fraction; moderate
coverage; LR monotonicity; and standard deviation) and perform one final refinement to
balance competing metrics if needed. Where band fraction is the percentage of patients in
a one or more given bands, moderate coverage is the percentage of patients in the middle
band, and LR monotonicity is likelihood monotonicity.
E Expected Values/Reference Range:
A reference range study was conducted to establish the performance of the TriVerity Acute
Infection and Sepsis Test with a healthy population. Samples were collected from diverse
geographical locations in the U.S. and India from individuals who self-reported their healthy
status. A total of 120 remnant samples were obtained from previous clinical studies and
commercial bio-banked samples. The presumed healthy population included male and female
patients 18 – 71 years old with a mean age of 41 years. Results from the study are included in
Tables 43 – 46 and stratified by demographic group.

The reference interval was determined to be 7.0 – 27.1 for the Bacterial score, 7.0 – 41.0 for the
Viral score, and 3.0 – 19.0 for the Severity score. Viral scores appear to be elevated in the
presumed healthy population, with a high proportion of African Americans falling into the High
and Very High interpretation bands. A limitation statement has been included in the labeling that
this test is not indicated for patients who are presumed to be in good health.
F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Not applicable.
VIII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
IX Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
