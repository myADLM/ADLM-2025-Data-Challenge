C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx – For Prescription Use Only
• SmartAdjust™ technology should not be used by anyone under the age of 2 years old.
• SmartAdjust™ technology should also NOT be used in people who require less than 5
units of insulin per day as the safety of the technology has not been evaluated in this
population.
• Do not use SmartAdjust™ technology in pregnant women, critically ill patients, and
those on dialysis. The safety of the SmartAdjust™ technology has not been evaluated in
these populations.
• Do not use SmartAdjust™ technology if you are taking hydroxyurea as it could lead to
falsely elevated CGM values and result in over-delivery of insulin that can lead to severe
hypoglycemia.
• Do not use SmartAdjust™ technology if you do NOT have adequate hearing and/or
vision to allow recognition of all functions of the Omnipod 5 System, including alerts,
alarms, and reminders.
• SmartAdjust™ technology used with the Omnipod 5 System is designed to use rapid-
acting U- 100 insulins. The following U-100 rapid-acting insulin analogs have been
tested and found to be safe for use in the Pod: NovoLog® (insulin aspart), Humalog®
(insulin lispro), and Admelog® (insulin lispro) for use up to 72 hours (3 days). Before
using a different insulin with the Omnipod 5 System, check the insulin drug label and
consult your healthcare provider. Refer to the insulin labeling and follow your healthcare
provider’s directions for how often to replace the Pod.
• SmartAdjust™ technology used with the Omnipod 5 System relies on accurate, current
CGM values to determine your insulin needs. Always make sure you are using the CGM
per manufacturer's instructions and do not extend the sensor wear beyond the
recommended duration.
• Do NOT attempt to use the SmartAdjust™ technology with the Omnipod 5 System
before you receive training. Inadequate training could put your health and safety at risk.
• Device components used with the SmartAdjust™ technology including the pod, CGM
transmitter, and CGM sensor must be removed before Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or diathermy treatment. In addition, the
SmartAdjust™ Controller and smartphone should be placed outside of the procedure
room. Exposure to MRI, CT, or diathermy treatment can damage the components.
III Device Description
SmartAdjust™ technology (the Omnipod 5 interoperable automated glycemic controller, iAGC)
is a software-only medical device intended for the management of type 1 diabetes in people 2
years of age and older. With this submission, the sponsor intends to market the device to adults
aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes as well. SmartAdjust™ technology is part of the
Omnipod 5 System made of the following components:
• Omnipod 5 ACE Pump (pod) – product code QFG, most recently cleared under K231826
• SmartAdjust™ Technology – product code QJI, most recently cleared under K232741
• SmartBolus Calculator – product code QRX, most recently cleared under K231824
K241777 - Page 2 of 16

--- Page 3 ---
• Integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM) – cleared for use with Dexcom G6 and
G7, and Abbott Freestyle Libre 2
The SmartAdjust™ technology software resides on the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump (the Omnipod 5
Pod and Omnipod 5 App). The iAGC software is responsible for controlling insulin delivery via
compatible ACE Pump when the system is in Automated Mode. iCGM data is transmitted from
the iCGM to the ACE Pump via Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The SmartAdjust™
Technology uses this transmitted iCGM data in its calculations. The SmartAdjust™ technology
can be turned off, and the Omnipod 5 ACE Pump will operate in Manual Mode, which delivers
insulin based on healthcare provider (HCP) or user-defined basal programs.
The SmartAdjust™ technology has three states of operation: Automated Mode, Automated:
Limited, and Activity. In Automated Mode, the system calculates insulin delivery every 5
minutes based on the user-customizable glucose target (110–150 mg/dL). Automated: Limited is
enabled when the SmartAdjust™ technology is not receiving data from a connected iCGM for 20
minutes or more and during sensor warm-up. While in Automated: Limited, the user will receive
no more than pre-programmed basal insulin. When a valid glucose value is received from the
iCGM, the SmartAdjust™ technology will resume delivery of insulin in full Automated Mode.
Activity is a temporary mode which the user may select for various time durations during
automated mode up to 24 hours. With Activity, the algorithm reduces insulin delivery and sets a
temporary glucose target to 150 mg/dL. Activity is intended for use during periods when insulin
sensitivity is expected to be higher, such as during exercise.

Summary of Clinical Testing:
The SECURE-T2D clinical study was conducted to evaluate the SmartAdjust™ Technology in
adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes.
Study Feature Description
Title Safety and Efficacy of the OmniPod 5 Automated Insulin
Delivery System in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes (SECURE-
T2D)
Study Design Single-arm, multicenter, prospective clinical study
Number of Sites Twenty-one (21) sites in the United States
Population 343 subjects aged 18 years and older who had been diagnosed
with type 2 diabetes were enrolled. 289 participants
completed the study.
Key Inclusion Criteria
• Aged 18-75 years old
• Diagnosed with T2D and on current insulin regimen
for at least 3 months prior to screening
• Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) < 12% at screening
Key Exclusion Criteria
• Use of an AID pump in automated mode within 3
months prior to screening
• Episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic
ketoacidosis in the past 6 months
The recruitment goal for this study was to enroll a
heterogenous subject pool reflective of the intended patient
population. The study is notable for diversity of age, BMI,
race/ethnicity, education, and income level in the subjects.
There was also a range of diabetes duration, non-insulin
medication, HbA1c, total daily dose, and carb-counting
knowledge.
Protocol Overview/Synopsis The study consisted of two phases:
1. 14-day standard therapy phase (baseline)
2. 13 weeks treatment on the Omnipod 5 System with
planned meal and exercise challenges
For the standard therapy phase, current Dexcom G6 iCGM
users could provide data from a 14-day period within the last
30 days. Non-Dexcom iCGM users wore a study iCGM, in
blinded mode, to record glucose measurements over 14 days
while subjects managed their diabetes at home per their usual
routine and remained on their current multiple daily injection
or pump therapy, and sensor, if applicable.

After completion of the standard therapy phase, subjects were
trained on the Omnipod 5 System and transitioned to the
hybrid-closed loop (HCL) therapy phase.
Subjects participated in various challenges during the study:
1. Target glucose challenge: 64 study participants utilized 3
different glucose targets for 3 days each (150 mg/dL, 140
mg/dL, and 130 mg/dL).
2. Meal challenge: All study participants completed 4 days of
a meal challenge that consisted of a meal that was ≥60 g of
carbohydrates. Subjects gave a meal bolus with that meal on
days 1 and 3 and skipped a meal bolus on days 2 and 4, and
CGM metrics were compared 4 hours post meal.
3. Exercise challenge: All study participants underwent 3
exercise sessions on 3 days. Exercise consisted of 1 hour of
mild intensity exercise and 30 minutes of moderate intensity
exercise. Subjects did not change their glucose target before
exercising. Subjects who consumed a meal prior to exercise
followed their normal meal bolus routine (i.e., meal boluses
were not adjusted to account for exercise), and 93% did not
consume a snack prior to exercise. CGM metrics were
assessed during exercise, 2 hours after exercise, and overnight
after exercise.
As part of the study, subjects completed questionnaires to
assess patient reported psychosocial outcomes: T2-Diabetes
Distress Assessment System, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index,
and the Hypoglycemia Confidence Scale.
Safety Results There was 1 severe hypoglycemia event during the study
period, which was attributed to a manual bolus request that
was greater than necessary for the food that was consumed.
The study algorithm stopped insulin delivery in the setting of a
decreasing glucose an hour after the bolus was administered,
but the subject still experienced a hypoglycemic event. The
subject was able to correct this with oral carbohydrates.
There were no other severe hypoglycemia or diabetic
ketoacidosis events during the study. There were 14 serious
adverse events not related or unlikely to be related to the study
device or treatments.

Observed Results
The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline (8.2%) to the end of 13 weeks of
Omnipod 5 System use (7.4%). There was a mean change in HbA1c of –0.8% (P<0.001), with a
larger change in mean HbA1c for those with a higher baseline HbA1c. The table below shows
the results of the primary safety and efficacy endpoints across the entire study population:

mean (SD) (1.3%) (0.9%) (-1.0%, -0.7%)
aTesting for non-inferiority with a NI limit of 0.3%.
bA sensitivity analysis was done using Rubin’s multiple imputation for the N=9 participants who dropped out
without a 13-week HbA1c value. This gave the same point estimate, confidence interval and p-value as above: -0.8%
(-1.0%, -0.7%); p<0.001. Note, any HbA1c measurements outside the analysis window of 42-119 days (6-17 weeks)
from AID initiation were treated as missing data.
There was no statistically significant change in HbA1c between sex, income or education level,
or other medication use. There was a significant change in HbA1c between different age,
race/ethnicity, pre-study carb counting knowledge, and baseline HbA1c. Specifically, the most
improvement in HbA1c was noted in Hispanic or other subjects, subject ages 31-45 years old,
and subjects who did not carb count prior to this study. Finally, subjects with the highest starting
baseline (HbA1c ≥ 9%) had the greatest improvement in HbA1c from a mean of 10.1% to 8.1%.
The table below shows subgroup analyses for the change in HbA1c by baseline characteristics:

*Based on the pre-specified criteria (“CGM analyses will include all participants with ≥168 hours of CGM data
during each of the Standard therapy period and the 13-week treatment period.”), N=299 for the glycemic metrics.
^Similar with medians, robust means do not add up; that is difference of medians is not the same as the median of
the differences. On the other hand, standard means add up and thus any inconsistency noticed above is due to
rounding.
†Lower scores indicate better outcomes (e.g., less stress/distress related to diabetes, better sleep quality).
#As part of the hierarchy testing and because of the p-value=0.10 for PSQI > 5 the formal testing stopped, and p-
values were not given for any outcomes further down on the list.
Challenge Results
During this clinical study, subjects participated in up to 3 different challenges. Sixty-four
subjects participated in a target glucose challenge in which they utilized 3 different glucose
targets for 3 days each (150 mg/dL, 140 mg/dL, and 130 mg/dL). The mean time in range was
the highest in the 150 mg/dL target group (66%) and was lower in the two remaining target
groups (63% in both). There was no significant difference in time above 180 mg/dL or 250
mg/dL between all three groups and there was a mean of 0% time below 70 mg/dL and 54 mg/dL
in all three groups.

All subjects participated in the meal challenge which lasted 4 days and consisted of a meal that
was ≥60 g of carbohydrates. Subjects gave a meal bolus on days 1 and 3 and skipped the meal
bolus on days 2 and 4. CGM metrics were compared at 4 hours post meal. The mean time in
range was elevated when given a bolus (55%) compared to without a bolus (44%). There was
more time above range when the bolus was skipped, but no difference in time below range for
the two different actions.
All subjects also participated in the exercise challenge in which they underwent 3 exercise
sessions on 3 separate days. The exercise session consisted of 1 hour of mild intensity exercise
and 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise. Subjects did not change their glucose target, nor
did they change their behavior for administering meal boluses prior to exercise if a meal was
consumed, and 93% of them did not consume a snack prior to exercise. CGM metrics were
assessed during exercise, 2 hours after exercise, and overnight after exercise. The mean time in
range for all 3 timepoints was the same (73%) and time above 180 mg/dL was the same (27%).
There was 0% time below 70 mg/dL and 54 mg/dL at all three timepoints. There was a slight
increase in time above 250 mg/dL in the 2 hours post-exercise.
Summary of Human Factors Validation Study
Human Factors validation tests were conducted with the Omnipod 5 App installed on a
compatible mobile device. A total of 1 feasibility study and 3 formative studies were conducted.
This Human Factors program consisted of an iterative design process of prototyping, testing,
analyzing, and refining the Omnipod 5 System for the type 2 diabetes indication. Following the
4 total preliminary studies, the final device design was evaluated in the summative study
performed with 16 representative participants interacting with the device in a simulated use
environment. All study participants received training that was consistent with the training that
patients would receive with the commercial product. Usability evaluations assess
comprehension and usability of the device for critical device tasks. Results of the study
demonstrated that the device could be used safely by intended users in the intended use
environment.
VII Proposed Labeling:
The labeling supports the finding of substantial equivalence for this device.
VIII Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
