C Type of Test:
The TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel is a multiplex, real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Applied Biosystems TaqPath COVID‑19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel is a multiplex,
real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test for
the qualitative detection and differentiation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
Nucleic acids are isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and anterior nasal (AN)
swab specimens obtained from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of a respiratory tract
infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection due to SARS-CoV-2,
influenza, and RSV can be similar. This test is intended to aid in the differential diagnosis of
SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV A/B (undifferentiated) infections in humans
and is not intended to detect influenza C virus infections.
Nucleic acids from the viral organisms identified by this test are generally detectable in NP and
AN swab specimens during the acute phase of infection. The detection and identification of
specific viral nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory tract
infection are indicative of the presence of the identified virus and aids in diagnosis if used in
conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information, and laboratory findings.
The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other
patient management decisions. Positive results do not rule out coinfection with other organisms.
The organism(s) detected by the Applied Biosystems TaqPath COVID‑19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV
Select Panel may not be the definite cause of disease. Negative results do not preclude SARS-
CoV-2, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, or RSV infections.
The Applied Biosystems TaqPath COVID‑19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel is intended for
use by qualified and trained clinical laboratory personnel specifically instructed and trained in
the techniques of real-time PCR and in vitro diagnostic procedures.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel is a multiplex, real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B
and RNase P primer and probe sets are designed to detect viral RNA in nasopharyngeal (NP) and
anterior nasal (AN) swab specimens from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of a
respiratory tract infection. Each TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel includes
the following components:
• TaqPath COVID‑19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Assay—Multiplex assays that contain
primer and probe sets specific to the following targets:
Three SARS-CoV-2 targets (Orf1a, Orf1b, and N genes);
o
Two influenza A virus targets (PB1 and M genes);
o
Two influenza B virus targets (M and NS genes);
o
Three RSV targets (NP, M, and L protein genes);
o
RNase P (internal human sample collection control).
o
• TaqPath COVID‑19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Positive Control—Inactivated viral
control that contains SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV.
• TaqPath COVID‑19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Negative Control—MS2 packaged RNA
control that contains targets specific to RNase P genomic regions targeted by the assay.
• TaqPath 1-Step Select Master Mix (No ROX)—Ready-to-use PCR mix, including
reverse transcriptase, polymerase, deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), salts, and
buffer.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV viral assay targets, the assay
portion of the panel includes RNase P, which serves as an endogenous internal process control to
monitor extraction and amplification of each clinical sample. The TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A,
Flu B, RSV Select Panel also contains external process positive and negative controls. The
positive control (PC) component included is an inactivated viral control that contains SARS-
CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viruses. The PC monitors extraction and real-time
RT-PCR by demonstrating that each of the four viruses can be detected when present and that
RNase P is not detected when absent. The negative control (NC) component included is an MS2
packaged RNA control that contains targets specific to RNase P genomic regions targeted by the
assay. The NC also monitors extraction and real-time RT-PCR by demonstrating RNase P can be
detected when present and that the four viruses are not detected when absent. The TaqPath 1-
Step Select Master Mix (No ROX) included as a component of the kit is a ready-to-use PCR mix
which contains a deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate mix (dNTPs), enzymes, and other
components to permit reverse transcription and amplification of the assay targets. The TaqPath
1-Step Select Master Mix (No ROX) also contains ribonuclease (RNase) inhibitors as well as
deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) and uracil N-glycosylase (known as UNG or UDG),.
The TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel workflow begins with nucleic acid
extraction from nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal swab specimens stored in viral transport
media (VTM) or universal transport medium (UTM). Nucleic acids are isolated and purified
from the specimens using the MagMAX Dx Viral/Pathogen NA Isolation Kit with the
K241806 - Page 3 of 37

--- Page 4 ---
KingFisher Apex Dx Purification System. In this process, nucleic acids from the patient samples
are recovered using magnetic-bead technology.
The purified nucleic acid is reverse transcribed into cDNA and amplified using the TaqPath
COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel and the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 5 Dx
Real-Time PCR instrument. The Applied Biosystems Diomni Software is used for the TaqPath
COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel results interpretation and is supplied with the
QuantStudio 5 Dx Real-Time PCR instrument.
B Principle of Operation:
Once the reaction plate is loaded onto the real-time PCR instrument, RNA is reverse transcribed
into cDNA. After heat inactivation of the reverse transcriptase enzyme, thermal cycling for PCR
amplification commences.
During the anneal/extension phase of a PCR cycle, primers and probes specific to the target
genes bind to corresponding DNA sequences in the indicated targets. The 5’ nuclease activity of
Taq polymerase degrades the probe, causing the reporter dye to separate from the quencher dye,
generating a fluorescent signal. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved
from their respective probes, increasing the overall fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence intensity
is monitored at each PCR cycle by the real-time PCR instrument.
The Diomni Software implements the thermal cycling program, secondary analysis and clinical
interpretation of the results using assay-specific parameters from the Assay Definition File
(ADF) that is installed in the software. When the software analyzes the run data, validation is
performed automatically via quality check (QC) analysis. For a plate run, QC is based on the
performance of the positive and negative controls; results interpretation of controls is described
in Table 1. Individual samples are also subject to QC checks according to the rules provided in
Table 2. A Positive call for RNase P is only required for samples that are negative for all four
viral targets; samples with no amplification are called Invalid. The data and interpretive results
for each run are saved as a batch in the software.

b. Reproducibility
A blinded, multi-site reproducibility study was conducted to assess the total variability of
the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel across operators, study sites,
testing days, runs, instruments, and reagent lots.
The same nine contrived panels evaluated in the Within-laboratory Precision Study
(Table 3) were also tested in the Reproducibility Study. The study was performed across
three independent sites, each with two operators per site across five non-consecutive days
using the QS5Dx instrument. Each panel member was tested with each of the three (3)
real-time PCR reagent lots in triplicate, for a total of nine (9) replicates per panel member
in every run. At least one (1) Negative Control (NC) and one (1) Positive Control (PC)
was included per run. For each panel member, a total of 270 replicates were generated
per instrument (3 replicates/lot x 3 lots x 2 operators x 3 sites x 5 days).
The percent agreement with expected results and Cq variability analysis results from the
study are summarized in Table 6 and Table 7.

2. Linearity:
Linearity is not applicable, as the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel is a
qualitative test.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a. Interfering Substances
Potential interference of the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel was
assessed by testing contrived positive samples consisting of one strain each of SARS-
CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020), influenza A (H1N1pdm, Michigan/45/15), influenza B
(Yamagata, Florida/04/06) and RSV (RSVB/CH93(18)-18)) at 3x their respective limits
of detection (LoDs) as well as negative samples in the presence or absence of the twenty-
six (26) potentially interfering substances, two (2) solvents, one (1) no interferent control,
and five (5) viral transport media (VTM). Additionally, potential interference due to
extraction reagent carryover was assessed with four (4) carryover conditions and one (1)
no-carryover control. For all potential interferents other than VTM, contrived samples
were prepared in pooled negative NP swab specimens in VTM/UTM. VTM testing used
pooled negative AN swab specimens that had been collected in the VTM . Each
substance was tested in triplicate (N=3) for each positive and negative sample through the
full workflow with one (1) lot of reagents on the QS5Dx instrument.
Detection of both Flu A and Flu B in all samples tested with FluMist at 0.05%, 0.01%
and 0.005% v/v was expected since it is a live-attenuated virus vaccine. The presence of
FluMist did not result in false positive or false negative results for the other targets at any
of the three concentrations tested. None of the other exogenous or endogenous
substances, transport media or extraction kit reagents tested interfered with the TaqPath
COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel at the concentrations tested. The results from
the study are presented in Table 8.

b. Competitive Interference
In this study, the ability to detect a co-infection when one targeted virus is present at a
high concentration (105 TCID /mL) and another targeted virus is present at a low
50
concentration (3x LoD) was assessed using contrived NP samples in VTM/UTM
containing all possible pairings of influenza A, influenza B, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV. In
parallel, viruses were tested at both levels individually to serve as controls and serve to
demonstrate within-panel specificity of each of the target channels. Sample extraction
was performed using the KingFisher Apex, and real-time RT-PCR was performed on the
QS5Dx with one (1) lot of TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel reagents.

No off-target false-positive results were observed in these test conditions, which
demonstrates within-panel specificity for each of the target channels. Negative, pooled
NP specimens were tested alone (with no virus) as a negative control condition and
yielded negative test results. As shown in Table 9, no competitive interference was
observed at the concentrations tested.

c. Cross-Reactivity and Microbial Interference Wet-Testing
Cross-reactivity and microbial interference was assessed for the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu
A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel. Testing included microbes that are commonly found in
upper respiratory samples, including commensal flora and pathogenic microbes. In the
cross-reactivity portion of the study, contrived samples were prepared by spiking
microbes into negative pooled nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples in UTM/VTM to
determine whether false positive results may be produced for any of the targets of the
test. In addition to contrived samples, results from samples tested during the Clinical
Validation study that had been called positive for coronavirus HKU1 (CoV-HKU1) by
the comparator test were assessed for evidence of cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2
(USA-WA1/2020), influenza A (Michigan/45/15), influenza B (Florida/04/06) or RSV
(CH93(18)-18). In the microbial interference portion of the study, the same
microorganisms were tested in the presence of one representative viral strain for each of
SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV at 3x LoD to determine whether false
negative results may be produced for the spiked targets. Each sample was tested in
triplicate through the full workflow with one lot of reagents on the QS5Dx instrument.
Bacteria and fungi were tested at 106 CFU/mL and viruses were tested at 105 TCID /mL,
50
or the highest concentration possible. As shown in Table 10, no cross-reactivity or
microbial interference was observed at the concentrations tested.

and -70°C) temperatures for specified time periods prior to testing with the TaqPath
SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel. The test condition for samples stored at
30°C included an additional storage of those samples at 8°C for 80 hours after
completion of the specified time periods at 30°C. Five (5) replicates of samples for each
storage condition in each specimen matrix were tested. Two (2) replicates of pooled
negative NP and AN swab specimens in UTM/VTM were also tested at all storage
conditions. Samples were extracted using KingFisher Apex Dx Purification System, and
real-time PCR was performed on the QS5Dx with one lot of assay reagents.
All targets for both NP and AN specimens in VTM/UTM produced 100% positivity at all
the time points tested for the 8°C, 30°C and the ≤-70°C temperatures. The AN specimens
also demonstrated 100 % agreement with the expected results for all the targets at all time
points for the -30°C to -10°C storage condition. The specimen stability results are
summarized in Tables 11-13 below.
These data support the claimed specimen stability in the Instruction for Use of 24 hours
at room temperature (15–25°C), 72 hours refrigerated (2–8°C) and 30 days at ≤-70°C.

c. Extraction Eluate Freeze-thaw Stability
The eluate stability study evaluated the performance of stored and frozen-and-thawed
nucleic acid eluates with the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel. NP
and AN specimens in VTM/UTM were contrived with one strain individually of SARS-
CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020), influenza A (California/07/09), influenza B (Florida/04/06)
and RSV (RSV A, 2013 isolate) to 3x LoD prior to being extracted with the MagMAX
Dx Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit on the KingFisher Apex to collect the
eluates. Fifteen replicates each of NP and AN specimen eluates were either tested fresh or
tested after storage at 2°C to 8°C for up to 27 hours followed by storage at ≤ -70°C for
more than 6 days and undergoing two (2) freeze/thaw cycles. Stability was determined
from three (3) time points. Testing was performed with one lot of the TaqPath COVID-
19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel on the QS5 Dx instrument.
100% of contrived positive samples produced the expected results at all three (3) time
points evaluated. The results demonstrate that extracted sample eluates from contrived
NP and AN swab samples containing SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B or RSV
were stable when held for 27 hours at 8°C followed by more than 6 days at ≤ -70°C while
undergoing two (2) freeze/thaw cycles. Therefore, the results support eluates storage
claims at 2°C to 8°C for up to 24 hours, storage at ≤ -70°C for up to 5 days and/or up to
one (1) freeze/thaw cycle.
d. Fresh vs Frozen Specimen Study
Fresh vs. frozen equivalency was assessed by testing contrived positive samples
consisting of one representative strain of influenza A (H1N1pdm, Michigan/45/15),
influenza B (Yamagata, Florida/04/06), SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) and RSV
(RSVB, CH93(18)-18) at 2x and 5x their respective LoDs. Contrived samples were
prepared in pooled, negative NP and AN specimens in VTM/UTM, respectively. Each
sample for each condition was tested with twenty replicates (N=20) for the 2x LoD
concentration and with ten replicates (N=10) for the 5x LoD concentration through the

full TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel workflow. Testing was
performed on freshly contrived samples and samples that had undergone two (2), three
(3) and six (6) freeze/thaw cycles with one lot of reagents on the QS5Dx instrument.
Additionally, negative samples were also tested for all the conditions with five replicates
(N=5). The results of this study support the use of frozen specimens in the clinical
performance study and the claim in the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select
Panel Instructions for Use that specimens collected in Copan UTM Universal Transport
Medium or BD Universal Viral Transport (UVT) Medium may undergo up to 2
freeze/thaw cycles. Do not exceed 1 freeze/thaw cycle for specimens collected in other
transport media types.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel
was determined for two (2) strains of influenza A H1N1, two (2) strains of influenza A
H3N2, one (1) strain of influenza B of Victoria lineage, two (2) strains of influenza B of
Yamagata lineage, one (1) strain of SARS-CoV- 2, one (1) strain of RSV A and one (1)
strain of RSV B. Each virus was spiked into pooled, negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab
specimens in VTM/UTM, extracted on the KingFisher Apex Dx Purification System, then
PCR was performed on the QS5Dx instrument across three (3) days, with two (2) reagent
lots. LoDs for all viruses except the influenza B Victoria lineage strain were also determined
in anterior nasal (AN) swab specimens in VTM/UTM.
The preliminary LoD was determined by probit analysis separately for each virus in each
specimen type with each reagent lot, and the highest (i.e., worst-case) LoD value across
reagent lots was selected as the preliminary LoD for that virus in the respective specimen
type.
The preliminary LoDs determined by probit analysis were confirmed by testing at least 24
replicates at, above, and below the preliminary LoDs. Contrived specimens were prepared
with negative clinical matrix (NP and AN swab specimens in VTM/UTM) and tested on the
QS5Dx instrument. The LoD for the TaqPath COVID‑19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel is
shown in Table 14 below.

a. Limit of Detection with WHO Standard
The study was performed using two-phase approach to determine the TaqPath
COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel LoD using the WHO Standard on the
QS5Dx instrument. Contrived specimens were formulated with the First WHO
International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 RNA spiked into pooled, negative anterior
nasal (AN) swab specimens in VTM/UTM at various concentrations.
Once formulated, contrived specimens were extracted and detected using the TaqPath
COVID- 19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel in Phase I (range finding). The results of
Phase I were used to establish the preliminary LoD (which was the lowest
concentration to generate 100% positivity when tested in triplicate). In Phase II, the
preliminary LoD was confirmed as the lowest concentration that results in at least
95% positive detection (≥95% positive) when tested with 20 replicates. Phase II
testing was performed in a blinded format.
The results of Phase I testing produced a preliminary LoD of 5.012 × 101 IU/mL,
which was the lowest (most dilute) concentration that yielded 100% positivity. In
Phase II, the LoD was confirmed at 150.36 IU/mL as the lowest concentration that
resulted in ≥ 95% positive detection as summarized in Table 15 below.

7. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity)
a. In-silico Inclusivity
Table 16 summarizes the genome sequences for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus,
influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus that were downloaded from GISAID
and GenBank on the indicated dates and analyzed for identity and melting temperature
(Tm). Genomes with 100% identity and/or Tm greater than annealing temperature (Ta)
for at least one assay were designated as reactive. For influenza A, wet testing with a
predominant mismatch demonstrated no significant difference in detection between the
mismatched sequence and reference sequence, therefore genomes with that mismatch
were also predicted to be reactive.

[1] Mismatch substitution was wet tested and showed no significant reduction in sensitivity compared with reference.
Including strains with this mismatch in the counts produces a predicted inclusivity of 95.27%.
b. Inclusivity Wet-Testing
Reactivity (inclusivity) was determined for eleven (11) strains of influenza A (H1N1),
twelve (12) strains of influenza A (H3N2), five (5) strains of influenza B (two (2) of
Victoria lineage and three (3) of Yamagata lineage), six (6) strains of RSV (three (3)
each of RSV A and B), five (5) strains of SARS-CoV-2 and five (5) avian influenza
strains (one (1) each of H5N1, H5N2, H7N2, H7N7 and H7N9). Each virus was
introduced at near-LoD levels into negative, pooled NP swab specimens in VTM/UTM,
then extracted and detected with the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select
Panel. Sample extraction was performed using the KingFisher Apex, and real-time RT-
PCR was performed with the QS5Dx using one (1) lot of TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A,
Flu B, RSV Select Panel reagents. Each sample was formulated with live virus,
inactivated virus or genomic RNA, depending upon availability and tested in triplicate
(N=3). Virus strains that did not produce 100% detection at approximately 3x LoD were
further tested at progressively higher concentrations until 100% detection was achieved.
The results are summarized in Table 17.

8. RNase P Internal Control Cutoff Confirmation
In the RNase P Internal Control Cutoff Confirmation study, viral target-negative “used” (i.e.,
collected from individual donors and containing RNase P) nasopharyngeal (NP) swab
specimens and “unused” (i.e., unopened and not containing RNase P) NP swabs were tested
according to the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel Instructions for Use.
The IC cutoff was confirmed at Cq = 33.0 while testing individually collected NP swabs. The
results demonstrated an overall positive percent agreement (PPA) of 98.07% (95% CI of
97.31-98.63%) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of 100% (95% CI of 97.49-100%) for
RNase P detection in NP swabs. For AN swabs, PPA for RNase P detection was 92.30%
(95% Score CI of 90.83-93.54%) and NPA was 100% (95% Score CI of 97.50-100%).
Due to the lower than expected PPA observed for AN specimens in the RNase P Cutoff
confirmation study, an additional study was conducted utilizing an improved AN swab
collection technique. All of the evaluated samples produced valid calls. Two (2) out of the
one hundred thirty-eight (138) AN samples were positive for COVID-19, while the rest were
negative for all viral targets. RNase P was detected in 100% of both negative and positive
samples. The results are summarized in Table 18.

This study has demonstrated that the improved AN swab collection technique reduces the
invalid rate for AN swabs when tested with the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV
Select Panel. The TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel Instructions for Use
include the improved AN swab collection instructions.
9. Carry-Over:
The study was conducted using negative and contrived specimens of pooled nasopharyngeal
(NP) swabs collected in VTM/UTM in a modified checkerboard pattern so that 12 positive
samples per extraction event were included amongst 82 negative samples. Extraction was
completed using contrived specimens with high-titer inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral material
and downstream real-time PCR with the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select
Panel assay and workflow. The entire workflow was evaluated from sample extraction to
real-time PCR results.
Six plates containing 12 high-positive samples (SARS-CoV-2 at 1 x 105 PFU/mL in pooled
NP specimens in VTM/UTM) surrounded by negative NP samples were extracted by two
operators on two different KingFisher Apex Dx Purification System instruments and tested
sequentially with the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel.
None of the 492 negative sample replicates tested produced a positive result for SARS-CoV-
2, demonstrating a carryover/cross-contamination rate of 0%.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Refer to Clinical Studies Section of this document.
2. Matrix Comparison:
This study was conducted to establish matrix equivalency for the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A,
Flu B, RSV Select Panel among nasopharyngeal (NP) and anterior nasal (AN) swab
specimens collected in VTM/UTM.
Contrived samples prepared with one strain each of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B
and RSV. Forty (40) replicates at 5x LoD, 20 replicates at 2x LoD and 20 negative replicates
were tested in NP and AN sample matrices with one lot of the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A,
Flu B, RSV Select Panel reagents on the QS5Dx instrument. Matrix equivalency was
demonstrated with a percent positivity of 100% at 5x LoD and 2x LoD for both matrices. All
negative replicates gave negative results, producing a 0% rate of positivity (Table 19).

C Clinical Studies:
1. Prospective Clinical Study
One NP swab and one AN swab was prospectively collected from each subject enrolled in
the study from 14 diverse sites in the US. NP and AN swabs were collected in UTM, and the
collection order (first specimen collected) was alternated between NP and AN swabs.
Specimens were collected by trained healthcare professionals between February 20, 2023 and
February 29, 2024. AN swabs were collected by swabbing both nares with the same swab,
and NP swabs were collected from either of the two nostrils.
One thousand eight hundred and forty (1,840) subjects who were experiencing signs and
symptoms of respiratory viral infection were enrolled into prospective collection of this
study. Data collected from one duplicate enrollment was excluded from the study and two
additional subjects withdrew from the study before samples could be collected. AN and NP
samples were collected from each of the remaining 1,837 subjects. In addition, 54 AN swabs
were excluded due to collection site protocol deviations, four AN swabs were excluded due
to testing site protocol deviations, 132 AN swabs were excluded due to a contamination event
at one of the testing sites, one AN swab was excluded due to invalid comparator test result,
105 AN swabs were excluded due to invalid TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select
Panel results. These exclusions resulted in 1,541 AN swabs that were included in final
performance analysis, of which 1,192 specimens were tested fresh (Category I specimens)
with the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel and 349 were tested after
freezing (Category II specimens). Two (2) of the 1,541 AN specimens observed inconclusive
comparator results for influenza A, leaving 1,539 evaluable AN specimens for influenza A
target. Of the 1,840 subjects enrolled in the prospective study, 1,647 had their AN swab
specimens evaluated with the candidate device. One hundred seventy nine (179) of these
specimens were invalid by the candidate device during testing, for an initial invalid rate of
10.9% (179/1,647). Upon retesting, the invalid rate for AN specimens decreased to 6.4%
(105/1,647).
Of the 1,837 NP swabs that were collected, 55 were excluded due to collection site protocol
deviations, three due to testing site protocol deviations, 132 due to contamination event at
one of the testing sites and 27 due to invalid TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select
Panel results. A total of 1,620 NP swabs were included in final performance analysis, of
which 1,246 specimens were tested fresh (Category I specimens) with the TaqPath COVID-
19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel and 374 were tested after freezing (Category II

specimens). Four (4) of the 1,620 NP specimens observed inconclusive comparator results
for Flu A, leaving 1,616 evaluable NP specimens for Flu A. Of the 1,840 subjects enrolled in
the prospective study, 1,647 had their NP swab specimens evaluated with the candidate
device. Forty five (45) of these specimens were invalid by the candidate device during
testing, for an initial invalid rate of 2.7% (45/1,647). Upon retesting, the invalid rate for NP
specimens decreased to 1.6% (27/1,647).

Results from the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel were compared
against an FDA cleared molecular comparator test. The PPA and NPA for SARS-CoV-2,
influenza A, influenza B and RSV for NP and AN specimens, along with the two-sided 95%
confidence intervals were calculated using the Wilson Score method and are shown in Table
21. Samples that produced a discordant call between the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B,
RSV Select Panel and the comparator test were further tested with another FDA cleared
molecular test. Results from discordant sample testing are presented as footnotes below the
table but were not used in performance calculations.

2. Enrichment Phase
After one thousand (1,000) subjects were enrolled in the prospective study and the desired
minimum number of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were collected, an enrichment phase of
the study was initiated to supplement the prospective data for influenza A, influenza B and
RSV. Three (3) of the fourteen (14) collection sites enrolled subjects for the enrichment
phase. Subjects who were experiencing signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection
with a positive PCR test result for influenza A, influenza B and/or RSV within three (3) days
prior to enrollment were included in the study.
A total of 69 subjects were enrolled during the enrichment phase of this study, one AN and
one NP swab was collected from each of the 69 subjects. One AN swab was excluded from
the performance analysis due to a collection site protocol deviation. Sixty-eight (68) AN and
69 NP swabs were included in the performance analysis for the enriched sample cohort. Sixty
(60) specimens were tested fresh with the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select
Panel and nine (9) NP swabs and eight (8) AN swabs specimens were tested after freezing.
No invalid results were observed in the enrichment phase for an invalid rate of 0.0% for both
AN and NP specimens.
Demographics of subjects included in the enrichment phase are summarized in Table 23.

D Clinical Cut-Off:
The clinical cut-off study for target analytes was established in two phases. The first phase was a
preliminary benchmarking investigation into the performance of the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A,
Flu B, RSV Select Panel against two comparator devices to assess performance near the
analytical limits of the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel. The second testing
phase, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) justification study, was designed to further
evaluate the TaqPath COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel with clinical and contrived
samples against each comparator device for the purpose of defining the clinical cut-off prior to
design validation. Based on these analyses, the assigned Cq cutoffs for the TaqPath COVID-19,
Flu A, Flu B, RSV Select Panel are shown in Table 26.
