determination of fentanyl in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 1.0 ng/mL. The assay is
intended for use with BioSieve™ Toxismart Reader.
It is for in vitro diagnostic use only.
The tests provide only preliminary results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be
used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
(GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any drug test result,
particularly when the preliminary test result is positive.

K241869 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The BioSieve™ Fentanyl FIA Test Kit uses the principle of competitive and fluorescence
immunochromatography. The nitrocellulose membrane test area (T) of the test strip is coated
with fentanyl-bovine serum albumin conjugate, and the quality control area (C) is coated with
goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody. Both Fentanyl monoclonal antibody and rabbit IgG
polyclonal antibody labeled with fluorescent microspheres are embedded on the conjugate pad.
The labeled antibody will flow forward with the sample when the urine sample is applied to the
sample well of the test device. When the concentration of fentanyl in the sample is higher than or
equal to the cut-off of the product, it will compete with the corresponding conjugate coated on
the test area (T) to bind to the fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody. Thus, fluorescence
signal rendering of the test line is inhibited, and the result is positive. If the sample does not
contain fentanyl or its concentration is lower than the cut-off of the product, the corresponding
conjugate on the test line reacts with sufficient fluorescently-labeled monoclonal antibodies.
Thus, the test line will develop a fluorescence signal and the result is negative. The quality
control area (C) will also develop a fluorescence signal, indicating that the testing has been
performed correctly.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
BioSieve™ Toxismart Reader
2. Specimen Identification:
Each sample is assigned a numerical identifier.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen collection, preparation, and handling conditions are described in the package insert

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
1) Lay User Study:
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 140 lay persons. They
had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to >50
years. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations: -100%, +/-75%, +/-
50%, +/-25% of the 1 ng/mL cut-off, by spiking fentanyl into drug free-pooled urine
specimens. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers, blind-labeled and
randomized. Testing was conducted using one lot of BioSieve™ Fentanyl FIA Test Kit
and a total of 8 BioSieve™ Toxismart Readers. Each participant was provided with the
package insert, one blind labeled sample and a device. The concentrations of the samples
were confirmed by LC/MS. The results are summarized below:

+50% Cutoff 20 1.508 20 0 100
+75% Cutoff 20 1.768 20 0 100
Lay-users were also given a questionnaire on the ease of understanding the package insert
instructions. All lay users indicated that the device instructions can be easily followed. A
Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on the package insert and the score
revealed a reading grade level of less than 8.
2) Effect of Temperature and Humidity:
A study was conducted to investigate the effect of using a test device outside of the
temperature and humidity operating conditions. The product labeling instructs the
operator to allow the test device to reach operating temperature (64.4-77ºF, 18-25ºC)
prior to use. The claimed humidity operating range for the system is 10 to 90% RH.
Temperatures ranging from 45-110°F (7.2-43.3°C) and relative humidity from 10-90%
were tested. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. The following
conditions were tested:
- Condition 1: ambient condition (20ºC and 50% RH)
- Condition 2: excessive temperature (40ºC) and humidity’s of 5% RH
- Condition 3: excessive temperature (40ºC) and humidity’s of 95% RH

- Condition 4: stored in the refrigerator, 2-8°C for 1 hour. The test devices were run
immediately after taking out of the refrigerator.
- Condition 5: low temperature (7.2 ºC) and 5% RH
- Condition 6: low temperature (7.2 ºC) and 95% RH
Samples with concentrations of -100% cutoff, -50% cutoff and +50% cutoff for fentanyl
cutoff concentration of 1 ng/mL were tested. 3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were
used for testing. All samples generated expected results, indicating that the test device is
tolerant to inappropriate temperature and humidity.
3) Effect of Vibration:
A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of vibrations produced by nearby laboratory
equipment on the performance of the fentanyl test device when run on the analyzer. Test
devices were prepared with samples at with concentrations of -100% cutoff, -50% cutoff
and +50% cutoff. 3 lots of cartridges and 3 analyzers were used for testing. Samples were
tested at ambient temperature, placed in close proximity (within 1 foot) to a centrifuge
running at 9,500 rpm or to a centrifuge running at 15,000 rpm. All samples generated
expected results, indicating that the device is tolerant to vibrations coming from a
centrifuge at the rpm tested.
4) Effect of Time Lapse:
A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of time lapse between applying the sample
on the test device and inserting the test device into the reader. The product labeling
instructs that during the test procedure, insert the sample-added test device into the slot of
BioSieve™ Toxismart Reader immediately. The testing was performed by evaluating
time lapse from 0 to 3 minutes (i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 3 minutes). Samples with concentrations
of -100% cutoff, -50% cutoff and +50% cutoff were tested. 3 lots of test devices and 3
readers were used for testing. All samples generated expected results, indicating that that
the test device is tolerant to inappropriate time lapse between applying the sample on the
test device and inserting the test device into the reader.
5) Effect of Drop
A was conducted to evaluate the potential of the invisible damage to the test device when
inadvertently dropped or knocked over during the procedure both before and after sample
addition to the device.
- Condition 1: reader plus test device were dropped from the test height (6.5 foot, 2
meters) onto the floor prior to sample addition. After dropping, samples were added,
and each test device was tested.
- Condition 2: reader plus test device were dropped from the test height (6.5 foot, 2
meters) onto the floor after sample addition. After dropping, each device was tested.
Samples with concentrations of -100% cutoff, -50% cutoff and +50% cutoff were tested.
3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were used for testing. All samples generated expected
results, indicating that the test device is tolerant to drop of 6.5 feet (higher than the
normal expected height when an operator drops a test device).
6) Effect of Sample Volume:
The study was conducted to investigate the effect of adding insufficient or excess number
of drops from the specimen collection container into the sample well. The product
labeling instructs that during the test procedure, user should add three drops (~75 μL) of
the sample to the sample well of the test device using the Dropper. The testing was
K241869 - Page 8 of 10

--- Page 9 ---
performed by evaluating number of drops from 0.67x to 1.67x the nominal volume (i.e.,
2, 3, 4, and 5 drops of sample). Samples with concentrations of -100% cutoff, -50%
cutoff and +50% cutoff were tested. 3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were used for
testing. All samples generated expected results, indicating that the test device is tolerant
to incorrect sample addition to the sample well.
7) Effect of Using Expired Test Devices:
A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of using expired test devices. Three lots of
expired cassettes (different expiration dates) were used in this study. Results support that
the test device yields an error code when expired cassettes are used.
8) Effect of Analyzer Assembly Held at an Angle While Reading Results:
A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of placing the assembled fentanyl test
device in holder with the analyzer at different angle facing the operator reading of the
results. Test devices were prepared with sample (with concentrations of -100% cutoff, -
50% cutoff and +50% cutoff) and tested at different angle of from 15-90 degrees (i.e., 15,
30, 45, 60,75 and 90 degree). 3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were used for testing.
All samples generated expected results, indicating that holding the analyzer assembly at
an angle while reading results has no impact on the performance.
9) Effect of Incorrect Orientation of Test Device in Holder:
A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of incorrect orientation of the test device in
the holder on reading the results by the Analyzer. Three incorrect orientations were tested
with respect to the correct orientation of the test device in the holder:
- Condition 1: correct orientation
- Condition 2: upside down from the correct orientation
- Condition 3: 180◦ rotation from correct orientation
- Condition 4: 180◦ rotation and upside down from correct orientation
Samples with concentrations of -100% cutoff, -50% cutoff and +50% cutoff were tested.
3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were used for testing. Results support that when the
orientation is incorrect, the test device cannot be scanned.
10) Effect of Reader Button Pressed Throughout the Run:
A study was to evaluate the effect of touching the left and/or right reader button by
mistake throughout the run (from start of the run to result display). Samples with
concentrations of -100% cutoff, -50% cutoff and +50% cutoff were tested. 3 lots of test
devices and 3 readers were used for testing. All samples generated expected results,
indicating that pressing of the left and/or right reader button by mistake during the run
does not affect the final test results.
11) Effect of Environmental Light:
A she study was conducted to evaluate the effect of environmental light (with and
without direct sunlight) on reading of test results by BioSieve™ Toxismart Reader. The
testing was performed across the following three conditions: (1) indoors with only light
and no sunlight; (2) outdoors in direct sunlight and (3) indoors with indirect sunlight.
Samples with concentrations of -100% cutoff, -50% cutoff and +50% cutoff were tested.
3 lots of test devices and 3 readers were used for testing. All samples generated expected
results, indicating that the test device is tolerant to different lighting conditions.
