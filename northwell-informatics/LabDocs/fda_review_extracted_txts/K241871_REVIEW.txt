The Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS) is an automated digital slide creation, viewing,
and management system. The PIPS is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the
pathologist to review and interpret digital images of surgical pathology slides prepared from
formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. The PIPS is not intended for use with frozen
section, cytology, or non-FFPE hematopathology specimens.
The PIPS comprises the Image Management System (IMS), the Ultra Fast Scanner (UFS) and
Philips PP27QHD display or a Beacon C411W display. The PIPS is for creation and viewing of
digital images of scanned glass slides that would otherwise be appropriate for manual
visualization by conventional light microscopy. It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist
to employ appropriate procedures and safeguards to assure the validity of the interpretation of
images obtained using PIPS.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS) is an automated digital slide creation, viewing
and management system. PIPS is for creation and viewing of digital images of scanned glass
slides that would otherwise be appropriate for manual visualization by conventional light
microscopy. The PIPS does not include any automated image analysis applications that would
constitute computer aided detection or diagnosis. The pathologists only view the scanned images
and utilize the image review manipulation software in the PIPS.
PIPS consists of two subsystems and a display component:
• Ultra Fast Scanner (UFS)
• Image Management System (IMS)
• Clinical Display
The UFS subsystem scans coverslipped glass slides to produce whole slide images (WSI) of the
tissue material mounted on the pathology glass slides. The slides are placed in racks which are
then placed in rack slots in the UFS. The scanning procedure requires minimal user interaction.
The UFS consists of optical, mechanical, and electronic elements as well as software
components.
The IMS is a software only subsystem and consists of the IMS Application Server and Storage
software and IMS Viewer software installed on compatible server hardware. Functionality of the
IMS includes the ability to view WSIs, organize workload, and annotate and bookmark scanned
slide images. The pathologist uses the IMS Viewer to interact with the IMS Server to store and
retrieve the pathology data (digitized slide images, patient data).
The new display Beacon C411W is connected to a client computer with access to the IMS
Viewer. The display is calibrated using the built-in calibration sensor and software tool, which
automatically perform a periodic calibration. The pathologist uses the display for viewing Whole
Slide images using the IMS Viewer software.
