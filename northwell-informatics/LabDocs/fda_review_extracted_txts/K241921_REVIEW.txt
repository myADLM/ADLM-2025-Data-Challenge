A Intended Use(s):
Alinity m BKV is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the quantitation of BK virus
(BKV) DNA in human EDTA plasma (K2 EDTA, K3 EDTA, and PPT) and urine stabilized
using the Alinity m Urine Transport Kit on the automated Alinity m System.
In EDTA plasma (K2EDTA, K3EDTA, and PPT) and urine stabilized using the Alinity m Urine
Transport Kit, Alinity m BKV is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis and management of
BKV in transplant patients.
In patients undergoing monitoring of BKV in EDTA plasma, serial DNA measurements can be
used to indicate the need for potential treatment changes and to assess viral response to
treatment.
The results from Alinity m BKV must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical signs and
symptoms and other relevant laboratory findings. Alinity m BKV is not cleared as a screening
test for blood or blood products or human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Same as Intended Use
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use with the Alinity m System.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Alinity m BKV assay is an automated assay for the quantitative detection of BKV genomic
DNA in human plasma or urine specimens utilizing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Alinity m BKV contain different components: Reagents (PCR amplification, detection, and
internal control), Calibrator and Controls. The Alinity m BKV assay requires a transport kit for
testing all urine specimens.
B Principle of Operation:
BKV DNA from human plasma or urine is extracted automatically on board the Alinity m
System. The Alinity m System employs magnetic microparticle technology to facilitate nucleic
acid capture, wash, and elution. The purified DNA is combined with the Alinity m BKV
activation reagent and the Alinity m BKV amplification/detection reagents and transferred into a
reaction vessel. Alinity m Vapor Barrier Solution is then added to the reaction vessel which is
then transferred to an amplification/detection unit for PCR amplification and real-time
fluorescence detection of BKV DNA. In addition to the BKV primers and probes, the assay
utilizes an IC primer/probe set for amplification and detection of the IC target sequence, which is
not related to BKV. Manual dilutions may be performed for low-volume plasma specimens to
K241921 - Page 2 of 23

--- Page 3 ---
meet the minimum volume requirement. A BKV calibration curve is required for determination
of BKV DNA concentration. Two levels of calibrators are processed through sample preparation
and PCR to generate the calibration curve. The concentration of BKV DNA in specimens and
controls is then calculated from the stored calibration curve. Assay controls (negative, low
positive and high positive controls) are tested to ensure that instrument and reagent performance
remains satisfactory.

2. Linearity
a. Linearity in Plasma:
The quantitation range of Alinity m BKV for plasma is from the lower limit of quantitation
(LLoQ) of 50 IU/mL (1.70 Log IU/mL) to the upper limit of quantitation (ULoQ) of
1,000,000,000 IU/mL (9.00 Log IU/mL). Linearity of Alinity m BKV was assessed by
testing a dilution series of BKV subgroup Ib in BKV-negative human plasma, consisting of
15 panel levels targeted in the range of 30 IU/mL to 2,000,000,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL
to 9.30 Log IU/mL). Plasma panel was prepared either using the international standard
material for BK virus (NIBSC code: 14/212, subgroup Ib) for multiple levels ranging from
30 IU/mL to 100,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 5.00 Log IU/mL) or using armored DNA
for the remaining levels ranging from 100 IU/mL to 2,000,000,000 IU/mL (2.00 Log IU/mL
to 9.30 Log IU/mL). Results were analyzed according to CLSI EP06, 2nd Edition.
Alinity m BKV was linear across the quantitation range from 50 IU/mL (1.70 Log IU/mL) to
1,000,000,000 IU/mL (9.00 Log IU/mL) in plasma. Representative results for Alinity m
BKV linearity performance are shown in Figure 1.

b. Linearity for Genotypes in Plasma:
Linearity of Alinity m BKV for subgroups/subtypes Ia, Ic, II, III, and IV was confirmed by
testing a dilution series in BKV-negative human plasma, consisting of 13 panel levels for
subgroup/subtypes Ia, III, and IV and 12 panel levels for subgroup/subtype Ic and II,
targeted in the range of 30 IU/mL to 2,000,000,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 9.30 Log
IU/mL). For subgroup/subtypes Ia, III, and IV, plasma panel was prepared either using
clinical specimens for multiple levels ranging from 30 IU/mL to 100,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log
IU/mL to 5.00 Log IU/mL) or using armored DNA for the remaining levels ranging from
200 IU/mL to 2,000,000,000 IU/mL (2.30 Log IU/mL to 9.30 Log IU/mL). For
subgroup/subtype Ic and II, plasma panel was prepared using armored DNA for all levels
ranging from 30 IU/mL to 2,000,000,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 9.30 Log IU/mL).
Alinity m BKV was linear in plasma across the quantitation range from 50 IU/mL (1.70 Log
IU/mL) to 1,000,000,000 IU/mL (9.00 Log IU/mL) for subgroups/subtypes Ia, Ic, II, III, and
IV. Representative results for Alinity m BKV linearity performance for subgroups/subtypes
Ia, Ic, II, III, and IV, along with results for subgroup Ib (Figure 1), are shown in Figure 2.

The quantitation range of Alinity m BKV for urine is from the lower limit of quantitation
(LLoQ) of 50 IU/mL (1.70 Log IU/mL) to the upper limit of quantitation (ULoQ) of
1,000,000,000 IU/mL (9.00 Log IU/mL). Linearity of Alinity m BKV was assessed by testing
a dilution series of BKV subgroup Ib in BKV-negative stabilized urine, consisting of 16 panel
levels targeted in the range of 30 IU/mL to 3,000,000,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 9.48
Log IU/mL).
Urine panel was prepared either using international standard material for BK virus (NIBSC
code: 14/212, subgroup Ib) for multiple levels ranging from 30 IU/mL to 150,000 IU/mL
(1.48 Log IU/mL to 5.18 Log IU/mL) or using armored DNA for the remaining levels ranging
from 150 IU/mL to 3,000,000,000 IU/mL (2.18 Log IU/mL to 9.48 Log IU/mL).
Alinity m BKV was linear across the quantitation range from 50 IU/mL (1.70 Log IU/mL) to
1,000,000,000 IU/mL (9.00 Log IU/mL). Representative results for Alinity m BKV linearity
performance are shown in Figure 3.

d. Linearity for Genotypes in Urine:
Linearity of Alinity m BKV for subgroups/subtypes Ia, Ic, II, III, and IV was confirmed by
testing a dilution series in BKV-negative stabilized urine, consisting of 14 panel levels for
subgroup/subtypes Ia, III, and IV and 13 panel levels for subgroup/subtype Ic and II, targeted
in the range of 30 IU/mL to 3,000,000,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 9.48 Log IU/mL).
For subgroup/subtypes Ia, III, and IV, urine panel was prepared either using clinical
specimens for multiple levels ranging from 30 IU/mL to 150,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to
5.18 Log IU/mL) or using armored DNA for the remaining levels ranging from 300 IU/mL to
3,000,000,000 IU/mL (2.48 Log IU/mL to 9.48 Log IU/mL). For subgroup/subtype Ic and II,
urine panel was prepared using armored DNA for all levels ranging from 30 IU/mL to
3,000,000,000 IU/mL (1.48 Log IU/mL to 9.48 Log IU/mL).
Alinity m BKV was linear in urine across the quantitation range from 50 IU/mL (1.70 Log
IU/mL) to 1,000,000,000 IU/mL (9.00 Log IU/mL) for subgroups/subtypes Ia, Ic, II, III, and
IV. Representative results for Alinity m BKV linearity performance for subgroups/subtypes
Ia, Ic, II, III, and IV, along with results for subgroup Ib (Figure 3), are shown in Figure 4.

3. Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLoQ)
a. LLoQ in Plasma
The LLoQ is defined as the lowest concentration at which BKV DNA is reliably quantitated
within an acceptable total error of ≤ 1.00 Log IU/mL. Total error was estimated for detected
plasma samples from the LoD study by 2 methods:
Total Analytical Error (TAE) = |bias| + 2 × SD, and
Total Error (TE) = SQRT(2) × 2 × SD.
Panel members were dilutions of the international standard material for BK Virus (NIBSC
code: 14/212, subgroup Ib) prepared in BKV-negative plasma. The results of the
calculations are shown in Table 7 and support a claimed LLoQ for Alinity m BKV of 50
IU/mL (1.70 Log IU/mL) in plasma.

Confirmation testing for Alinity m BKV LLoQ using the dilution procedure was performed
by testing 2 panel members at 125 IU/mL (2.5 × LLoQ) and 150 IU/mL (3 × LLoQ) with a
dilution factor of 1:2.5. The BKV concentrations in the panel members were targeted at 50
IU/mL (LLoQ) and 60 IU/mL (near LLoQ). Panel members were dilutions of the
international standard material for BK Virus (NIBSC code: 14/212, subgroup Ib) prepared
in BKV-negative plasma.
Total error was estimated by TAE and TE, as shown in Table 8. The accuracy and
precision at 50 IU/mL and 60 IU/mL were confirmed for Alinity m BKV testing using the
1:2.5 dilution procedure.

urine is 50 IU/mL (1.70 Log IU/mL) to 1,000,000,000 IU/mL (9.00 Log IU/mL).
6. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
Primary calibrators and assay product calibrators with known concentrations were used
throughout product development and product manufacturing to establish traceability to the
international standard material for BK virus (NIBSC code: 14/212, subgroup Ib). The
K241921 - Page 16 of 23

concentrations tested for the international standard material were 3.00 Log IU/mL and 5.00
Log IU/mL. The target concentrations tested for the primary calibrators were 2.91 Log
IU/mL and 6.94 Log IU/mL. The Alinity m BKV product calibrators and controls were also
tested along with the primary calibrators and the international standard material. All the
tested material had observed BKV concentrations similar to the target concentrations and
were linear across the assay’s quantitation range, as presented in Figure 5.

7. Detection Limit:
a. Detection Limit for Plasma Samples:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by testing dilutions of the international
standard material for BK virus for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NIBSC code:
14/212, subgroup Ib) prepared in BKV-negative human plasma. Eight panel members with
BKV concentration ranging from approximately 2.0 to 60.0 IU/mL were tested. Testing for
each BKV DNA concentration was performed with 3 lots of amplification reagents across
multiple days in a minimum of 30 replicates per each panel member. The LoD was estimated
from the detection rate and probit analysis. The claimed LoD of Alinity m BKV is 50 IU/mL
(1.70 Log IU/mL) in plasma.
b. Detection Limits for Genotypes in Plasma.
BKV armored DNA for subgroup Ic and subtype II and clinical specimens for BKV
subgroup Ia and subtypes III and IV were diluted to 3 different concentrations (30, 50, and
60 IU/mL) in BKV-negative human plasma using one lot of amplification reagents. The
results demonstrated the ability of Alinity m BKV to detect BKV subgroups Ia and Ic and
subtypes II, III, and IV at the claimed LoD of 50 IU/mL (1.70 Log IU/mL) in plasma.
c. Detection Limit for Urine Samples.
The LoD was determined by testing dilutions of the international standard material for BK
virus (NIBSC code: 14/212, subgroup Ib) prepared in BKV negative urine stabilized in
transport buffer (Alinity m Urine Transport Kit). Nine panel members with BKV
concentration ranging from approximately 3.0 to 330.0 IU/mL were tested. Testing for each
BKV DNA concentration was performed with 3 lots of amplification reagents across multiple
days. The claimed LoD of Alinity m BKV is 50 IU/mL (1.70 log IU/mL) in neat urine.
d. Detection Limits for Genotypes in Urine.
BKV armored DNA for subgroup Ic and subtype II and clinical specimens for BKV subgroup
Ia and subtypes III and IV were diluted to 5 different concentrations in BKV-negative
stabilized urine, ranging from approximately 45.0 to 330.0 IU/mL. Testing was performed
using one lot of amplification reagents across multiple days. Alinity m BKV detected 95% or
greater of BKV samples at and above 45 IU/mL (1.65 Log IU/mL) in urine. The results
K241921 - Page 18 of 23

--- Page 19 ---
demonstrated the ability of Alinity m BKV the ability of Alinity m BKV to detect BKV
subgroups Ia and Ic and subtypes II, III, and IV at the claimed LoD of 50 IU/mL (1.70 Log
IU/mL) in urine.

a The LLoQ used here is the higher LLoQ between Alinity m BKV and comparator.
Of the 579 specimens, 29 confirmed BKV DNA negative clinical specimens were used for
the estimation of Negative Percent Agreement (NPA). For this subset of BKV DNA
negative clinical specimens, the NPA with the comparator assay was 100% (29/29) (95%
CI: 88.3% to 100%).
Regression and bias analysis included a total of 268 specimens with results that were within
the common quantitation range of both Alinity m BKV and the comparator. Figure 6 shows
the results of the Deming regression analysis with a slope of 1.07, intercept of –0.37, and
correlation coefficient of 0.953. The mean bias between Alinity m BKV and the comparator
(Alinity m BKV minus comparator) was –0.12 Log IU/mL (95% CI: –0.16 to –0.09 Log
IU/mL) and the systematic difference between both assays was -0.15 log10 IU/mL and -
0.08 log10 IU/mL for samples with DNA levels at 3 and 4 log10 IU/mL, respectively.

b. Clinical Performance for Urine Sample Type.
Alinity m BKV results were compared to those of an FDA-cleared BKV nucleic acid test in
a representative study. Alinity m testing was performed using urine specimens stabilized
using Alinity m Urine Transport Kit. A total of 380 urine specimens collected from solid
organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) subjects (1
specimen per subject) were included in the analysis. The Alinity m BKV assay testing was
performed at 3 clinical testing sites with 3 Alinity m BKV reagent lots. The agreement
between Alinity m BKV and comparator results is shown in Table 18.

Discordant results were defined as those that are more than one box away from the diagonal
(indicated by shading). For Target Not Detected (TND) by Comparator Column Agreement, the
Alinity m BKV Target Not Detected and <LLoQ cells were combined. Agreement between
Alinity m BKV assay and the comparator assay was also evaluated using different clinical
thresholds and is shown in Table 19.
