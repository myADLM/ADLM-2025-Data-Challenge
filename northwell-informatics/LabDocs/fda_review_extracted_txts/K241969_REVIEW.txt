III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Hightop® Home Use Fentanyl/Norfentanyl Urine Rapid Test Panel is a competitive binding,
lateral flow immunochromatographic assay for qualitative detection of fentanyl and norfentanyl,
the major metabolite of fentanyl in human urine at the cut-off concentrations listed below:
Analyte Cut-off Level
Fentanyl (FYL) 1ng/mL
Norfentanyl (NFYL) 5ng/mL
The test is available in a single test of FYL or NFYL or a Double panel of FYL and NFYL. It is
intended for OTC use.
The test provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific alternative chemical method
must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred
confirmatory method.
Hightop® Fentanyl/Norfentanyl Urine Rapid Test Panel is a competitive binding, lateral flow
immunochromatographic assay for qualitative detection of fentanyl and norfentanyl, the major
metabolite of fentanyl in human urine at the cut-off concentrations listed below:
Analyte Calibrator Cut-off Level
Fentanyl (FYL) Fentanyl 1ng/mL
Norfentanyl (NFYL) Norfentanyl 5ng/mL
The test is available in a single test of FYL or NFYL or a Double panel of FYL and NFYL.
The test panel provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS is the
preferred confirmatory method.
The test panel is not intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse of fentanyl.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to the test result, particularly
in evaluating a preliminary positive result.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Hightop® Home Use Fentanyl/Norfentanyl Urine Rapid Test Panel and Hightop®
Fentanyl/Norfentanyl Urine Rapid Test Panel are immunoassays intended for the qualitative
detection of fentanyl and norfentanyl in human urine. Each Hightop® fentanyl/norfentanyl urine
test device consists of a Test Panel and a package insert. Each Test Panel is sealed with sachets
of desiccant in an aluminum pouch.
B Principle of Operation:
These devices are rapid lateral flow immunoassays. To perform the test, the user will pull off the
cap on the device and activate the test by dipping the sample pads into human urine sample for 5-
10 seconds. Urine sample will be absorbed by the sample pad and move up to the conjugate pad
that contains anti-drug antibody colloidal gold conjugates. The urine sample will continue to
move up to the nitrocellulose membrane where drug protein is coated onto the Test Region. If
there is no drug present or the drug concentration in the specimen is below cutoff level, the red
colloidal gold conjugate will bind to the drug conjugate at the Test Region, to form a visible
band which indicated a negative result. If there is drug present in the specimen at above cutoff
level, the drug will bind to the limited antibodies on colloidal gold, leaving no antibody available
for binding to the drug conjugates on membrane. Thus, the absences of a test line band present at
Test Region indicates a presumptive positive result for that drug.
The Control Region is to indicate that the test has performed properly and should appear
regardless of the presence of the drug. This is a built-in internal control of the device. If control
line does not appear, the test result is invalid.

Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cut off, -75%
cut off, -50% cut off, -25% cut off, cut off, +25% cut off, +50% cut off, +75% cut off and
+100% cut off for each target drug. These samples were prepared by spiking fentanyl or
norfentanyl in negative urine samples. Each fentanyl or norfentanyl concentration was
confirmed by LC/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared
the samples and didn’t take part in the sample testing. Three operators tested blinded urine
samples over a 10-day period in randomized order with six tests per day per concentration
per lot per operator (6 replicate per day per lot x 9 concentrations) for a total of 54 tests per
day per operator.

Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH
To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples, with 1.000,
1.003, 1.006, 1.009, 1.011, 1.014, 1.017, 1.02, 1.023, 1.027, 1.031, and 1.035 specific gravity
or urine samples with pH 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,and 9 were spiked with targets fentanyl and norfentanyl
at 50% below and 50% above Cut-Off levels. These samples were tested using three lots of
device. Results were all positive for samples at and above +50% Cut- Offs and all negative
for samples at and below -50% Cut-Offs.
Read Time Study
Fentanyl and Norfentanyl Standards with concentrations of -50% cutoff, +50% cutoff, and
drug free urine were tested using three lots of the device and read at 10 time points (i.e. 3rd,
4th, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, 30th, 35th, 40th minutes) by three different operators
according to procedures in the product insert. All the results were consistent with the
required reading time at 5 minutes and not more than 10 minutes.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies for 1 lot of the Hightop® Fentanyl/Norfentanyl Urine Rapid Test
Panel were performed by three different operators. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40
positive) unaltered clinical samples. The samples were blind labeled and compared to LC/MS
results. The results are presented in the tables below.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
A lay user study was performed at three testing sites representative of intended use sites
with 140 lay users. The lay users had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and
ranged in age from 18 to >50 years. Three lots of the device were used in the study. Urine
samples were prepared at the following concentrations; -100%, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of
the cut-offs by spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations
of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual
containers, blind-labeled and randomized. Each participant was provided with the package
insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. The results are summarized below:
