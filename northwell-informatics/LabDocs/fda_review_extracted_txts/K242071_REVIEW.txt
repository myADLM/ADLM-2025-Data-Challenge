IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test, performed on the GeneXpert Xpress System, is an
automated in vitro diagnostic test for the simultaneous qualitative detection and differentiation of
SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and
anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens collected from individuals showing signs and symptoms of
respiratory viral infection. The test is performed with three steps: 1) transfer liquid sample to the
test cartridge with the transfer pipette (provided in the test kit), 2) run the test on the GeneXpert
Xpress System, and 3) read the results.
The Hub configuration of the GeneXpert Xpress System includes a GeneXpert IV Instrument, an
integrated barcode scanner, and a computer with a touchscreen and preloaded GeneXpert Xpress
software designed for running tests and viewing results. The system requires the use of single-
use disposable cartridges that hold the RT-PCR reagents and host sample purification, nucleic
acid amplification, and detection of the target sequences.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge includes all the necessary reagents for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV viral RNA from NPS and ANS
specimens collected with nylon flocked swabs and placed into either 3 mL viral transport
medium (VTM)/ universal transport medium (UTM) or 2 mL eNAT. With a supplied transfer
pipette, eluted NPS and ANS swab specimens are loaded into the sample chamber of a single-
use, self-contained Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge. Each Xpert Xpress CoV-
2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge contains separate chambers for sample loading, sample processing,
and target amplification by real-time RT-PCR, and includes all the reagents necessary to carry
out these processes.
The primers and probes in the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test are designed to amplify
and detect gene sequences for the following:
• SARS-CoV-2 (envelope small membrane protein [E], a sequence in the N nucleocapsid
protein [N2] and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRP])
• influenza A (matrix protein gene [MP], basic polymerase protein [PB2] and acidic
protein [PA] genes from the viral polymerase complex)
• influenza B (Matrix protein gene and non-structural protein [NS] gene)
• RSV A and B (Nucleocapsid gene segment) viruses
A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the
cartridge utilized by the GeneXpert instrument. The SPC is present to control for adequate
processing of the sample and to monitor for the presence of potential inhibitor(s) in the RT-PCR
reaction. The SPC also ensures that the RT-PCR reaction conditions (temperature and time) are
appropriate for the amplification reaction and that the RT-PCR reagents are functioning as
expected. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling, and confirms that all reaction
components are present in the cartridge including monitoring for probe integrity and dye
stability. Because the cartridges are self-contained, and specimens never contact working parts
of the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is minimized. The test
K242071 - Page 3 of 26

--- Page 4 ---
cartridge containing the patient sample is loaded onto one of four randomly accessible
GeneXpert instrument modules, which performs fully automated and integrated sample
preparation and real-time RT-PCR for the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test in
approximately 36 minutes.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test can be run in one of five different modes, varying in
the number of target analyte(s) tested for and reported. The five modes are: SARS-CoV-2 only;
SARS-CoV-2 and Flu; SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV; Flu only; or Flu and RSV. For the SARS-CoV-2
only and Flu only modes, there is an option to activate an Early Assay Termination (EAT)
function, which will provide earlier time to results in high titer specimens if the signal from the
target nucleic acid reaches a predetermined threshold before the assay has finished running.
When EAT is activated, the earliest time to a positive result is approximately 25 minutes. After
completion of the test, the assay results are interpreted by the GeneXpert software from
measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms and are shown in the “View
Results” window.
B Principle of Operation:
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test, performed on the GeneXpert Xpress System, is a
nucleic acid-based test using real-time RT-PCR. After addition of the specimen to the Sample
Chamber of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge, the cartridge is loaded onto the
GeneXpert Xpress System platform. The instrument then performs automated sample processing
including RNA extraction, followed by reverse transcription, amplification, detection, and
reporting of results. The results are interpreted automatically by the GeneXpert Xpress System
and are shown in the View Results window.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
GeneXpert Xpress System
2. Specimen Identification:
Sample ID is an identifier that links the sample being processed to the patient that provided
the specimen. The Sample ID can be entered into the GeneXpert Xpress System either by
scanning a barcode, entering the Sample ID manually using the virtual keyboard or having
the system assign a random Sample ID.
To perform a test, the user selects “NEW TEST” icon from the Home Screen. Either patient
information must be entered if configured by an administrator or the Sample ID screen
appears. If the Patient Information screen appears, manually enter or scan the Patient ID
barcode. If the Sample ID screen appears, scan the Sample ID barcode or manually enter the
Sample ID for the patient specimen. The user is then instructed to scan the cartridge barcode
and select the test to run. The prepared test cartridge is loaded into an available instrument
module with the flashing green light to initiate the test.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
K242071 - Page 4 of 26

--- Page 5 ---
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge includes reagents for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV viral RNA in either nasopharyngeal swab
(NPS) or anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens. The NPS or NS specimen is collected using
nylon flocked swabs and eluted into a transport tube containing 3 mL of viral transport
medium (VTM)/Universal Transport Medium (UTM) or 2 mL of eNAT. At the test facility,
the operator mixes the specimen by rapidly inverting the collection tube 5 times. A
disposable transfer pipette supplied with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus is used to
transfer an aliquot of the specimen into the Sample Chamber of the Xpert Xpress CoV-
2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge. After closing the cartridge lid, the GeneXpert cartridge is
loaded onto the GeneXpert Xpress instrument, which automates and integrates sample
preparation, nucleic acid extraction and amplification, and detection of target sequences in
simple or complex samples using real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays.
4. Calibration:
Calibration of the GeneXpert Xpress instrument is performed at the factory, and recalibration
in the field at customer sites is not required during the initial system startup. A GeneXpert
operator or Field Service Engineer with Administrator user permissions can perform
calibration checks during annual maintenance.
5. Quality Control:
Internal Controls
The GeneXpert Xpress System relies on the built-in internal controls included in each Xpert
Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test cartridge to ensure the test system is performing as
expected. These internal controls consist of Sample Processing Control (SPC) and Probe
Check Control (PCC).
The Sample Processing Control (SPC) is a non-infectious armored RNA pseudovirus that
ensures adequate processing of the sample and monitors the presence of potential inhibitors
in the RT-PCR reaction. The SPC should be POSITIVE in a sample that is negative for all
four target analytes (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV), and can be
NEGATIVE or POSITIVE in a sample containing detectable levels of one or more of the
target analytes.
The PCC is present to control for sufficient reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling, probe
integrity and dye stability. All assay reagents must be present and intact for the PCC to pass
the validated acceptance criteria. If any of the PCC conditions fails, the result is reported as
NO RESULT – REPEAT TEST and the test must be repeated using a new test cartridge.
External Controls
External controls (ECs) are not required for the end users to obtain a valid Xpert Xpress
CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test result. External controls are not provided with the Xpert Xpress
CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test. Optional external quality control materials are available from
Zeptometrix. Specifically, the following external controls have been validated for use with
the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test, performed on the GeneXpert Xpress System:
K242071 - Page 5 of 26

--- Page 6 ---
• External Positive Control: NATtrol Flu/RSV/SARS-CoV-2; Cat # NATFRC-6C-IVD
• External Negative Control: Coxsackievirus A9; Cat # NATCV9-6C-IVD
All external controls must be used in accordance with local, state, and federal accrediting
organizations, as applicable.
It is recommended that external controls be tested following the manufacturer’s instruction at
the frequency noted below.
• Each time a new lot of Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test kits is received.
• Each time a new shipment of Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test kits is received even
if it is the same lot previously received.
• Each time a new operator is performing the test (i.e., operator who has not performed the
test before).
• When problems (storage, operator, instrument, or other) are suspected or identified.
• If otherwise required by your institution’s standard Quality Control (QC) procedures.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A. Analytical Performance:
The studies conducted to support the analytical performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-
2/Flu/RSV plus test, performed on the GeneXpert Instrument Systems, were previously
reviewed and described in K231481. In this submission, analytical studies data generated on
the GeneXpert Instrument Systems were reanalyzed using the latest 6.4a GeneXpert Xpress
software to assess the analytical performance on the GeneXpert Xpress System.
The results from the analysis are described in sections below.
1. Precision/Reproducibility
a. Within-laboratory Precision
Within-laboratory precision was previously evaluated as described in K231481. A total of
687 test results (654 samples and 33 controls) were processed with the GeneXpert Xpress
software version 6.4a. In all cases, the runs gave the same results as described in K231481.
The reanalysis of the data from the within-laboratory precision study demonstrates
equivalent performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test on the GeneXpert
Xpress System.
b. Reproducibility
A blinded, multi-site reproducibility study was conducted to assess the total variability of
the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test on the GeneXpert Xpress System across
operators, study sites, testing days, runs and instruments. The reproducibility study design
incorporated two contrived reproducibility panels consisting of five panel members each as
indicated in Table 1.

“NO RESULT” messages were changed to “NO RESULT – REPEAT TEST”, 2 “ERROR”
messages were changed to “INSTRUMENT ERROR”, and 1 “ERROR” message was changed
to “NO RESULT-REPEAT TEST”. Twelve (12) “NO RESULT” and 8 “ERROR” messages
were unchanged.
Then, 586 tests from the LoD verification in NPS in UTM/VTM matrix were reanalyzed using
the latest 6.4a GeneXpert Xpress software. There were 580 valid results and 6 non-determinate
results. All 586 valid tests gave the exact same test results after the reanalysis. The number of
non-determinate results was unchanged, and one "NO RESULT" message and five "ERROR"
messages remained unchanged after the reanalysis.
The reanalysis of the data from the LoD in clinical NPS in UTM/VTM matrix studies from
K231481 demonstrates equivalent performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test
on the GeneXpert Xpress System.
The LoD concentrations and mean Ct values at the LoDs for clinical NPS in UTM/VTM
specimens tested using two reagent lots are shown in Table 3.

LoD in Clinical ANS in UTM/VTM Matrix
The LoD in clinical ANS in UTM/VTM was previously established as described in K231481 in
two steps. First, 3064 tests from the LoD estimation in clinical ANS in UTM/VTM matrix were
reanalyzed using the latest 6.4a GeneXpert Xpress software. There were 3040 valid results and
24 non-determinate results. All 3040 valid tests gave the exact same test results after the
reanalysis. The number of non-determinate results was unchanged, and ten "NO RESULT"
messages and 14 "ERROR" messages remained unchanged, after the reanalysis.
Then, 765 tests from the LoD verification in clinical ANS in UTM/VTM matrix in K231481
were reanalyzed using the latest 6.4a GeneXpert Xpress software. There were 760 valid results
and 5 non-determinate results. All 760 valid tests gave the exact same test results after the
reanalysis. The number of non-determinate results was unchanged, and five “ERROR”
messages remained unchanged, after the analysis.
The reanalysis of the data from the LoD in clinical ANS in UTM/VTM matrix studies from
K231481 demonstrates equivalent performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test
on the GeneXpert Xpress System.
The LoD concentrations and mean Ct values at the LoDs for clinical ANS in UTM/VTM

6. Assay Cut-Off:
Assay cut-off was previously reviewed and described in K231481.
7. Accuracy (Instrument):
Not Applicable.
8. Carry-Over:
Eighty-five (85) tests from the carry-over contamination study in K231481 were reanalyzed
using the latest 6.4a GeneXpert Xpress software. There were 82 valid results and three non-
determinate results. All 82 valid tests gave the exact same test results after the reanalysis.
While the number of non-determinate results was unchanged, one "NO RESULT" message
was changed to "NO RESULT - REPEAT TEST", and two "ERROR" messages were
changed to "NO RESULT - REPEAT TEST".
The reanalysis of the data from the carry-over contamination study from K231481
demonstrates equivalent performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test on the
GeneXpert Xpress System.
9. Matrix Comparison:
These studies were conducted to establish equivalent performance of Xpert Xpress CoV-
2/Flu/RSV plus between

10. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not Applicable.
B. Clinical Studies:
Prospective Clinical Study:
The performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus on the GeneXpert Xpress System
was established in a multi-site prospective clinical study that included 23 geographically
diverse sites in the United States (US) in specimens collected from individuals showing signs
and symptoms of respiratory infection. Of the 23 sites, 22 performed GeneXpert Xpress
System testing and specimen collection, and one site performed comparator testing and
discrepant investigation.
Prospectively collected, fresh (Category I) and frozen (Category II) nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)
and anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens in UTM/VTM, from individuals with signs and
symptoms of respiratory viral infection, were enrolled from January 24, 2022 to July 19, 2022 in
K242071 - Page 18 of 26

--- Page 19 ---
the US in an all-comers fashion. In addition, frozen NPS and ANS specimens in UTM/VTM that
were prospectively collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory viral
infection during the 2016-2017 influenza season in the US in an all-comers fashion (Category II
specimens) were also enrolled in the prospective clinical study to assess performance for the
influenza A, influenza B, and RSV analytes.
Subject/Specimen Enrollment
Specimens tested for the SARS-CoV-2 Analyte
There were 3807 prospective subjects/specimens enrolled for evaluating the performance of the
Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus on the GeneXpert Xpress System in testing for the SARS-
CoV-2 analyte. Six participants withdrew after enrollment without providing specimens resulting
in a total of 3801 subjects/specimens (1888 NPS and 1913 ANS). Seventy-five (75) specimens
were excluded (39 NPS and 36 ANS) as a result of not meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria or
as a result of an issue with informed consent documentation resulting in 3726 eligible specimens
(1849 NPS and 1877 ANS). A further 392 specimens (194 NPS and 198 ANS) were excluded
due to protocol deviations leaving 3334 specimens (1655 NPS and 1679 ANS). Unresolved
repeat non-determinate (ND) for GeneXpert Xpress System testing resulted in the exclusion of
18 additional samples (3 NPS and 15 ANS) from performance assessment, leaving 3316
specimens (1652 NPS and 1664 ANS). Finally, 169 specimens (87 NPS and 82 ANS) were
excluded from performance assessment due to non-evaluable/invalid comparator test results,
leaving 3147 prospective specimens (1565 NPS and 1582 ANS, Category I and II) eligible for
performance evaluation.
Specimens tested for the influenza A, influenza B, and RSV Analytes
There were 5166 prospective subjects/specimens enrolled for evaluating the performance of the
Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus on the GeneXpert Xpress System in testing for the Flu A/ Flu
B/ RSV analytes. Six participants withdrew after enrollment without providing specimens
resulting in a total of 5160 subjects/specimens. Seventy-five (75) specimens were excluded (39
NPS and 36 ANS) as a result of not meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria or as a result of an
issue with informed consent documentation resulting in 5085 eligible specimens (2571 NPS and
2514 ANS). An additional 524 specimens (271 NPS and 253 ANS) were excluded due to
protocol deviations leaving 4561 specimens (2300 NPS and 2261 ANS) eligible for performance
assessment. Table 5 describes demographic data for the prospective specimens available for
performance assessments. Of the 4561 specimens remaining, a further 26 samples (7 NPS and 19
ANS) were excluded from performance analysis due to unresolved ND (repeat ND or missing
repeat testing results) for GeneXpert Xpress System testing. This left 4535 specimens for
performance analysis (2293 NPS and 2242 ANS). Finally, 225 additional specimens (118 NPS
and 107 ANS) were excluded from performance analysis due to non-evaluable/invalid
comparator test results. This resulted in 4310 specimens (2175 NPS and 2135 ANS) eligible for
performance evaluation.

a The 4561 specimens comprise 3333 fresh (Category I) specimens and 1228 frozen (Category II)
specimens.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test on the GeneXpert Xpress System was evaluated for
SARS-CoV-2 performance by comparing to a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel that
includes SARS-CoV-2. For SARS-CoV-2 performance evaluations, only the prospective
specimens collected in 2022 were tested with the SARS-CoV-2 comparator, as specimens
collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., 2016-2017) were assumed to be SARS-CoV-2
negative.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test on the GeneXpert Xpress System was evaluated for
Flu A, Flu B, and RSV performance by comparing to a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular Flu
A/B/RSV assay. For Flu A, Flu B and RSV performance assessment, prospective specimens
collected in both 2022 and 2016-2017 were evaluated.
Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was calculated as 100% × (TP / (TP + FN)). True positive
(TP) indicates that both the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and the comparator method had a
positive result for the specific analyte, and false negative (FN) indicates that the Xpert Xpress
CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus was negative while the comparator result was positive. Negative Percent
Agreement (NPA) was calculated as 100% × (TN / (TN + FP)). True negative (TN) indicates that
both the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and the comparator method had negative results, and
false positive (FP) indicates that the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus was positive while the
comparator result was negative. Specimens that obtained discordant SARS-CoV-2 results
underwent additional testing with a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2 molecular test, while
specimens that obtained discordant Flu A, Flu B, or RSV results underwent additional testing
with a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel.
Prospective Clinical Performance
Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens
Of the 1565 prospective NPS specimens that were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 performance,
99.9% (1564/1565) were tested fresh (Category I), while 0.06% (1/1565) were tested frozen
(Category II) with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus. Of the 2175 prospective NPS
specimens that were analyzed for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV performance, 72.7% (1582/2175) were
tested fresh (Category I), while 27.3% (593/2175) were tested frozen (Category II) with the
Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus.
A summary of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test prospective clinical study performance

Non-determinate rates
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test on the GeneXpert Xpress System non-determinate
(ND) rate for prospective specimens (Category I and II) collected in 2022 and 2016-2017,
combined, was initially 2.7% (123/4561) and decreased to 0.6% (26/4561) upon retest.
For NPS specimens, the initial ND result was 2.5% (58/2300) and decreased to 0.3% (7/2300)
upon retest. With ANS specimens, the initial ND was 2.9% (65/2261) and, upon retest, was
decreased to 0.8% (19/2261).
For fresh vs frozen, the initial ND rate for fresh specimens was 2.7% (90/3333) and decreased to
0.5% (18/3333) with retesting. For frozen specimens, the initial ND rate was 2.7% (33/1228) and
it decreased to 0.7% (8/1228) with retesting.
Multi-target Detection
The number of specimens with positive results for one or more target analyte by the Xpert
Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and/or comparator assay(s) is presented in Table 8 and Table 9,
where bolded values indicate concordant results. As shown in Table 8, a total of 3028
prospective specimens collected in 2022 yielded valid results for all four targets for both the
Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and comparator assays. Note that influenza B is not presented
in Table 8, as no influenza B positives were obtained during the 2022 study. The rate of co-
infection for Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus was 0.1% (1/797) and the rate of co-infection by
the comparators was 0.3% (2/774). In total, 2 co-infections were detected by either the Xpert
Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test or the comparator assays for specimens collected in 2022. One
of these co-infections was discordant between the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus and the
comparator assays (see Table 8).

*The comparator assay for SARS-CoV-2 was a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel (under 21
CFR 866.3981) that includes SARS-CoV-2. The comparator assay for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV was a U.S.
FDA-cleared molecular Flu A/B/RSV assay.
As shown in Table 9, a total of 4310 prospective specimens, collected in 2022 and 2016-2017,
yielded valid results for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV by both the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus
and comparator assay. The co-infection rate for Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus was 2.04%
(15/737) and the co-infection rate by the comparator was 1.29% (9/698). In total, 17 co-
infections were detected by either the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test or the comparator
assay, of which ten were discordant (see Table 9).

D. Expected Values/Reference Range:
The 2022 prospective clinical study included a total of 3147 specimens (1565 NPS and 1582
ANS) with valid Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test and comparator SARS-CoV-2 results.
The 2022 and 2016-2017 prospective clinical studies included 3186 specimens (1583 NPS and
1603 ANS) and 1124 specimens (592 NPS and 532 ANS), respectively, with valid Flu A, Flu B,
and RSV results. The number and percentage of cases positive for SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B,
and RSV, as determined by the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus test are shown in Table 10,
stratified by collection period and age group, and Table 11, stratified by collection period and
specimen type.
