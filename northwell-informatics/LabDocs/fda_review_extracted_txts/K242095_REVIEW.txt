III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Access Toxo IgM II assay is a paramagnetic-particle chemiluminescent immunoassay for
the qualitative detection of Toxoplasma gondii-specific IgM antibody in adult human serum and
plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems.
The Access Toxo IgM II assay is presumptive for the diagnosis of acute, recent, or reactivated
Toxoplasma gondii infection in males and pregnant or non-pregnant females. It is recommended
this assay be performed in conjunction with a Toxoplasma gondii-specific IgG antibody assay.
Note: This assay has not been cleared/approved by the FDA for the screening of blood or plasma
donors in the United States.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Performance has not been established for the use of bodily fluids other than human serum or
plasma.
D Special Instrument Requirements:
DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Access Toxo IgM II assay is a paramagnetic-particle chemiluminescent immunoassay for
the qualitative detection of Toxoplasma gondii-specific IgM antibody in adult human serum and
plasma using the Access Immunoassay Systems.
The Access Toxo IgM II assay consists of the reagent pack, calibrators, and quality controls
(QCs), packaged separately. Other items needed to run the assay include substrate and wash
buffer.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access Toxo IgM II assay is an immunoenzymatic assay and uses the immunocapture
principle. The sample to be tested is added to a reaction vessel with paramagnetic particles
coated with human IgM-specific sheep polyclonal antibody as capture antibody. After incubation
in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while
unbound materials are washed away. Then a complex formed with T. gondii antigen and T.
K242095 - Page 2 of 8

--- Page 3 ---
gondii (P30)-specific monoclonal antibody that has been labeled with alkaline phosphatase is
added to the reaction vessel. After a second incubation and a second washing, the
chemiluminescent substrate is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured
with a luminometer. The photon production is a function of the amount of enzyme conjugate
present at the end of the reaction. The light quantity measured for a sample allows a
determination of the presence of T. gondii-specific IgM antibody, by comparison with a cut-off
value defined during the assay calibration on the instrument. If the light production is equal or
greater than the cut-off value, the sample is considered reactive in the Access Toxo IgM II assay.
The cutoff for non-reactivity is 0.8 S/CO and reactivity is 1.00 S/CO. Results between 0.8 – 1.0
S/CO (equivocal zone) should be confirmed by testing a new sample 10 to 20 days later. The
Access Toxo IgM II assay results interpretation is presented in Table 1.

VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:
The following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines were used:
• CLSI EP05-A3: Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement Procedures; Approved
Guideline
• CLSI EP12-Ed 3: Evaluation of Qualitative Binary Output Examination Performance; Approved
Guideline
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a) Within-Laboratory Precision: A 20-day within-laboratory precision study was conducted
using 3 lots of the Access Toxo IgM II reagents, three lots of the Access Toxo IgM II
calibrators and 3 DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer systems. Four human serum
samples were tested in 2 replicates at 2 runs per day over 20 days using 3 reagent
lot/calibrator lot combinations, where a unique reagent lot and calibrator lot are paired. The
data were analyzed for repeatability (within-run), between-run, between-day, and within-
laboratory precision. Within-laboratory precision data summary is shown in Table 2.
