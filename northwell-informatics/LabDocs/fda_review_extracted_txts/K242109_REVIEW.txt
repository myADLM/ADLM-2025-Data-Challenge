D Special Instrument Requirements:
GeneXpert Xpress System
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test, performed on the GeneXpert Xpress System, is an automated
in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 viral
RNA in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens collected from
individuals showing signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection. The test is performed
with three steps: 1) transfer liquid sample to the test cartridge with the transfer pipette (provided
in the test kit), 2) run the test on the GeneXpert Xpress System, and 3) read the results.
K242109 - Page 2 of 20

--- Page 3 ---
The Hub configuration of the GeneXpert Xpress System includes a GeneXpert IV Instrument, an
integrated barcode scanner, and a computer with a touchscreen and preloaded GeneXpert Xpress
software designed for running tests and viewing results. The system requires the use of single-
use disposable cartridges that hold the RT-PCR reagents and host sample purification, nucleic
acid amplification, and detection of the target sequences.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test cartridge includes all the necessary reagents for the detection
of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA from NPS and ANS specimens collected with nylon flocked swabs
and placed into either 3 mL viral transport medium (VTM)/ universal transport medium (UTM)
or 2 mL eNAT. With a supplied transfer pipette, eluted NPS and ANS swab specimens are
loaded into the sample chamber of a single-use, self-contained Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test
cartridge. Each Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test cartridge contains separate chambers for sample
loading, sample processing, and target amplification by real-time RT-PCR, and includes all the
reagents necessary to carry out these processes.
The primers and probes in the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test are designed to amplify and detect
gene sequences for the following:
• SARS-CoV-2 (envelope small membrane protein [E], a sequence in the N nucleocapsid
protein [N2] and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRP]).
A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the
cartridge utilized by the GeneXpert instrument. The SPC is present to control for adequate
processing of the sample and to monitor for the presence of potential inhibitor(s) in the RT-PCR
reaction. The SPC also ensures that the RT-PCR reaction conditions (temperature and time) are
appropriate for the amplification reaction and that the RT-PCR reagents are functioning as
expected. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling, and confirms that all reaction
components are present in the cartridge including monitoring for probe integrity and dye
stability. Because the cartridges are self-contained, and specimens never contact working parts
of the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is minimized. The test
cartridge containing the patient sample is loaded onto one of four randomly accessible
GeneXpert instrument modules, which performs fully automated and integrated sample
preparation and real-time RT-PCR for the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test in approximately 30
minutes.
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test includes an early assay termination (EAT) function which will
provide earlier time to results in high titer specimens if the signal from the target nucleic acid
reaches a predetermined threshold before all assay cycles have been completed. When the EAT
feature is activated, the earliest time to receive a positive result is calculated to be approximately
19 minutes.
B Principle of Operation:
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test is a nucleic acid-based test using real-time RT-PCR. After
addition of the specimen to the Sample Chamber of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test cartridge,
the cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert Xpress System platform. The instrument then
performs automated sample processing including RNA extraction, followed by reverse
K242109 - Page 3 of 20

--- Page 4 ---
transcription, amplification, detection, and reporting of results. The results are interpreted
automatically by the GeneXpert System and are shown in the View Results window.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
GeneXpert Xpress System
2. Specimen Identification:
Sample ID is a unique identifier that links the sample being processed to the patient that
provided the specimen. The Sample ID can be entered into the GeneXpert Xpress System
either by scanning a barcode, entering the Sample ID manually using the virtual keyboard or
having the system assign a random Sample ID.
To perform a test, the user selects “NEW TEST” icon from the Home Screen. Either patient
information must be entered if configured by an administrator or the Sample ID screen
appears. If the Patient Information screen appears, manually enter or scan the Patient ID
barcode. If the Sample ID screen appears, scan the Sample ID barcode or manually enter the
Sample ID for the patient specimen. The user is then instructed to scan the cartridge barcode
and select the test to run. The prepared test cartridge is loaded into an available instrument
module with the flashing green light to initiate the test.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test cartridge includes reagents for the detection of viral RNA
from SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and anterior nasal swab (ANS)
specimens. The specimens are collected with a nylon flocked swab and placed into a
transport tube containing 3 mL of viral transport medium (VTM)/Universal Transport
Medium (UTM) or 2 mL of eNAT. At the test facility, the operator mixes the specimen by
rapidly inverting the collection tube 5 times. A disposable transfer pipette supplied with the
Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus is used to transfer an aliquot of the specimen into the Sample
Chamber of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test cartridge. After closing the cartridge lid, the
GeneXpert cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert Xpress instrument, which automates and
integrates sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction and amplification, and detection of
target sequences in simple or complex samples using real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays.
4. Calibration:
Calibration of the GeneXpert Xpress instrument is performed at the factory, and recalibration
in the field at customer sites is not required during the initial system startup. A GeneXpert
operator or Field Service Engineer with Administrator user permissions can perform
calibration checks during annual maintenance.
5. Quality Control:
Internal Controls
K242109 - Page 4 of 20

--- Page 5 ---
The GeneXpert Xpress System relies on the built-in internal controls included in each Xpert
Xpress CoV-2 plus test cartridge to ensure the test system is performing as expected. These
internal controls consisted of Sample Processing Control (SPC) and Probe Check Control
(PCC).
Sample Processing Control (SPC) – The SPC is an encapsidated RNA pseudovirus that
ensures adequate lysis of target virus, monitors the presence of PCR inhibitors, and verifies
the use of proper PCR conditions. The SPC passes if it meets the validated acceptance
criteria. The SPC result should be PASS in a sample that is negative for all three SARS-CoV-
2 target analytes and can be NEGATIVE or POSITIVE in a sample containing detectable
levels of one or more of the SARS-CoV-2 target analytes.
Probe Check Control (PCC) – Before the start of the PCR reaction, the GeneXpert System
measures the fluorescence signal from the probes to monitor bead rehydration, reaction tube
filling, probe integrity, and dye stability. The PCC passes if it meets the validated acceptance
criteria. If any of the PCC conditions fails, the result is reported as NO RESULT – REPEAT
TEST and the test must be repeated using a new test cartridge.
External Controls
External controls (ECs) are not required for the end users to obtain a valid Xpert test result.
External controls are not provided with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test and are available
from Zeptometrix. Specifically, the following external controls have been validated for use
with the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test:
• External Positive Control: NATtrol SARS-Related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2);
Catalog# NATSARS(COV2)-ERC-IVD
• External Negative Control: NATtrol SARS Associated Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2);
Catalog# NATSARS(COV2)-NEG-IVD
All external controls must be used in accordance with local, state, and federal accrediting
organizations, as applicable.
It is recommended that external controls be tested following the manufacturer’s instruction at
the frequency noted below.
• Each time a new lot of Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus kits is received.
• Each time a new shipment of Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus kits is received even if it is the
same lot as previously received.
• Each time a new operator is performing the test (i.e., operator who has not performed the
test before).
• When problems (storage, operator, instrument, or other) are suspected or identified.
• If otherwise required by your institution’s standard Quality Control (QC) procedures.

2. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
In silico Analysis of Inclusivity
In silico SARS-CoV-2 analysis was previously reviewed and described in K230440.
Additionally, the inclusivity of Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus was evaluated using in-silico
analysis of the assay amplicons and probes against the 2,691,091 SARS-CoV-2 sequences
available in the GISAID gene database, for variants that were circulating between August 1st,
2022 and September 4th, 2023 for three SARS-CoV-2 gene targets, E, N2 and RdRP. The
2,691,091 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were separated into the lineages of interest based on the
Pango Lineage assigned to each genome by GISAID, and those with ambiguous nucleotides
were removed. The inclusivity analyses focused on the combined, non-ambiguous sequences
from the variants of interest and variants of concern between August 1st, 2022 and September
4th, 2023. These constituted 2,519,206 sequences for the E target, 2,551,690 sequences for
the N2 target and 2,476,229 sequences for the RdRP target. Table 4 shows the number of
sequences in each amplicon alignment and summarizes the effective predicted inclusivity for
E, N2 and RdRP amplicons for the variants of interest and concern.

Based on the built-in redundancy of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test’s SARS-CoV-2
amplification system (i.e., three independent targets, only one of three must be detected to
assign a positive result), all evaluated sequences are predicted to be detected by the Xpert
Xpress CoV-2 plus test.
Wet-Testing
Inclusivity wet-testing was previously evaluated as described in K230440. Two hundred
twenty-seven (227) runs were previously evaluated for the inclusivity study for K230440.
Out of the 227 runs, 20 tests were not able to be reanalyzed due to software incompatibility.
Two hundred and seven tests from the analytical inclusivity study were reanalyzed. There
were 206 valid results and one non-determinate result. All 206 valid tests gave the exact
same test results after reanalysis. The number of non-determinate (ND) GeneXpert results
was unchanged after reanalysis and the ND test results descriptions remained the same.

B Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Prospective Clinical Study
The performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test on the GeneXpert Xpress System was
established in a multi-site prospective clinical study that included 22 geographically diverse
locations in the United States in specimens collected from individuals showing signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection. Of the 22 sites, 21 sites performed GeneXpert Xpress
System testing and specimen collection while one (1) site performed comparator and
discrepant investigation.
Prospectively collected, fresh nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and anterior nasal swab (ANS)
specimens in UTM/VTM, from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory viral
infection, were enrolled from January 24, 2022 to May 16, 2022 in the US in an all-comers
fashion. Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus testing on the GeneXpert Xpress System was performed
from January 24, 2022 to May 16, 2022, at 21 testing sites.
There were 2200 prospective subjects/ specimens from symptomatic individuals enrolled for
evaluating the performance of the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test on the GeneXpert Xpress
System (1094 NPS and 1106 ANS). Of these, ten (10) subjects/ specimens (five (5) NPS and
five (5) ANS) were found to be ineligible as not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria or
having incomplete Informed Consent leaving 2190 eligible samples (1089 NPS and 1101
ANS). From these specimens, an additional 256 (128 NPS and 128 ANS) were excluded due
K242109 - Page 16 of 20

--- Page 17 ---
to protocol deviations leaving 1934 subjects/ specimens (961 NPS and 973 ANS) in the final
dataset. There were an additional 151 specimens excluded (NPS = 78 and ANS = 73) due to:
unresolved repeat ND for Xpert testing (n = nine (9), unresolved repeat ND and procedural
deviation with comparator testing (n = two (2) invalid and 138 non-evaluable comparator
results (n = 140). There 1783 samples/ specimens eligible for performance evaluation (NPS =

The Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus test on the GeneXpert Xpress System was evaluated by
comparing to a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular respiratory panel that includes SARS-CoV-2.
Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was calculated as 100% × (TP / (TP + FN)). True positive
(TP) indicates that both the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus and the comparator method had a
positive result, and false negative (FN) indicates that the Xpert Xpress CoV-2 plus was
negative while the comparator result was positive. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was
calculated as 100% × (TN / (TN + FP)). True negative (TN) indicates that both the Xpert
Xpress CoV-2 plus and the comparator method had negative results, and false positive (FP)

Non-determinate (ND) rate
Of the total 1934 prospective specimens evaluated, 81 specimens yielded an initial ND result.
After repeat testing, 70 specimens yielded a valid result such that the initial ND rate was
4.2% (81/1934) and final ND rate was 0.6% (11/1934).
• Of the 961 NPS specimens evaluated, 39 specimens yielded an initial ND result. After
repeat testing, 32 specimens yielded a valid result. The initial ND rate using NPS
specimens was 4.1% (39/961) and final ND rate was 0.7% (7/961).
• Of the 973 ANS specimens evaluated from the symptomatic population, 42 specimens
yielded an initial ND result. After repeat testing, 38 specimens yielded a valid result. The
initial ND rate using ANS specimens was 4.3% (42/973) and final ND rate was 0.4%
(4/973).
