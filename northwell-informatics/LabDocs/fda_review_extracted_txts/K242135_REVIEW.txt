D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The test comes in three formats (strip, cassette, and midstream) named Synthgene Home Test
HCG Test Strip, Synthgene Home Test HCG Test Cassette and Synthgene Home Test HCG Test
Midstream, respectively. Each test kit contains the individually packaged test, medical waste
bag, urine cup, and instructions for use. The strip format is a single test strip. The cassette format
consists of a single test strip assembled in a plastic housing. A pipette dropper is included in the
packaging. The strip is designed to be used in dip sampling mode only while the cassette format
is designed to be used in drop sampling mode only. The midstream format consists of a single
test strip assembled in a plastic housing with an absorbent tip and is designed to be tested in dip
or in-stream sampling mode.
B Principle of Operation:
Synthgene Home Test HCG Test Strip, Synthgene Home Test HCG Test Cassette and Synthgene
Home Test HCG Test Midstream use lateral flow immunoassay technology for in vitro
qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in human urine. When hCG is
present in the sample, the hCG antigen in the sample reacts with the colloidal
gold-labeled antibody (hCG mAb1) on the conjugate pad to form the labeled antibody-antigen
complex. The complex moves upward by capillary action and is captured by the test line (T line)
antibody (hCG mAb2) coated on the nitrocellulose membrane, appearing as a red band. The
complex continues to migrate and is captured by the control line (C line) antibody (goat anti-
mouse IgG polyclonal antibody) coated on the nitrocellulose membrane, and a red band appears.
When the test is performed properly, a colored line will always appear on the C line. The test
result appears within 5-20 minutes of urine addition. Two distinct colored lines, one at the T line
K242135 - Page 2 of 11

--- Page 3 ---
and another at the C line indicate a positive test result (pregnant). Absence of a colored line at
the T line and only a colored line at the C line indicates a negative test result (not pregnant).
Absence of a colored line at the C line even in the presence of a colored line at the T line
indicates an invalid test result.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed on the Synthgene Home Test HCG Test Strip, Synthgene
Home Test HCG Test Cassette and Synthgene Home Test HCG Test Midstream using
negative female urine samples spiked with hCG to obtain samples with hCG concentrations
of 0, 12.5, 18.75, 22.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mIU/mL. Each sample was tested using three
lots of the candidate device for all three formats. For the midstream format, samples were
tested using the dip sampling mode and simulated midstream sampling mode. Tests were
performed over the course of five days, at three sites, by three different operators, and in
replicates of ten per sample. A total of 450 replicates were performed per sampling mode per
hCG concentration. The samples were blinded and randomized before being given to the
operators. The results are summarized in the tables below:

2. Linearity:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference from exogenous and endogenous substances:
To evaluate potential interference from certain exogenous and endogenous substances,
negative urine samples from normal healthy females containing 0 mIU/mL and 25 mIU/ml
hCG were spiked with the potentially interfering substances at the concentrations listed in the
table below. For each test format, samples were tested in triplicate, using three lots of the
test. No interference was observed at the concentrations shown in the table below:

Cross-reactivity of Similar Compounds:
To evaluate cross-reactivity, negative and positive urine samples were spiked to contain 0
mIU/mL hCG (negative matrix) and 25 mIU/mL hCG and then spiked with potential cross-
reactants. Samples were spiked with 500 mIU/mL luteinizing hormone (hLH), 1000 mIU/mL
follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH), and 1 mIU/mL thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH).
Samples were tested in replicates of three using three lots of the test. No cross-reactivity was
observed at tested concentrations.
Effect of Urine pH:
A study was performed to evaluate the effects of urine pH on the candidate devices.
Negative, female, human urine samples were used to make samples containing 0 mIU/mL
and 25 mIU/mL hCG, which were then adjusted to pH values at 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 and tested
using the candidate devices. Samples were tested in replicates of three, using three lots of the
candidate devices. The results demonstrated that urine pH ranges between 4 and 9 do not
affect test performance.
Effect of Urine Specific Gravity:
A study was performed to evaluate the effects of specific gravity on the candidate devices.
Negative, female, human urine sample were used to make samples containing 0 mIU/mL and
25mIU/mL hCG, which were then adjusted to specific gravity values of 1.000, 1.002, 1.009,
1.012, 1.018, 1.028, 1.032, and 1.035 and tested using the candidate devices. Samples were
tested in replicates of three, using three lots of the candidate device. The results demonstrated
that urine with a specific gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.035 does not affect test
performance.
High dose hook effect study
A study was performed to evaluate whether there is a high dose hook effect using the
candidate devices. Negative, female, human urine samples were spiked with hCG
concentrations up to 1,860,000 mIU/mL and tested in replicates of ten using three lots of the
candidate device. No hook effect was observed at concentrations of up to 1,860,000 mIU/mL
hCG.

Effects of hCG β-core fragment:
Urine samples with hCG concentrations of 0 and 25 mIU/mL were spiked with hCG β-core
fragment (hCGβcf) at a concentration of 2,000,000 pmol/L. The samples were tested in
replicates of three using three lots of the device. All samples using all three test formats
yielded correct results with hCG β-core fragment at a concentration of 2,000,000 pmol/L.
