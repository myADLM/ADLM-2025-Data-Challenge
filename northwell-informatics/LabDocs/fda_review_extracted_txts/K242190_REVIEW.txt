K242190 - Page 2 of 10

--- Page 3 ---
The DxC 500i Clinical Analyzer is an integrated chemistry-immunoassay work cell that
combines Beckman Coulter’s DxC 500 AU Clinical Chemistry Analyzer and the Access 2
Immunoassay System into a single instrument presentation. The DxC 500i instrument has a
single user interface and common point of entry for sample racks; the sample handling unit
operates as a parallel processor and sample manager for both sides of the instrument.
B Principle of Operation:
The Access Cortisol assay is a competitive binding immunoenzymatic assay. A sample is added
to a reaction vessel with rabbit antibody to cortisol, cortisol-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and
paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-rabbit capture antibody. Cortisol in the sample
competes with the cortisol-alkaline phosphatase conjugate for binding sites on a limited amount
of specific anti-cortisol antibody. Resulting antigen: antibody complexes bind to the capture
antibody on the solid phase.
After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic
field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate is added
to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light
production is inversely proportional to the concentration of cortisol in the sample. The amount of
analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
DxC 500i Clinical Analyzer
2. Specimen Identification:
Samples are identified by a barcode label on the sample container that is associated with a
test order. Alternatively, for manually entered test orders, which do not require a barcode
label, samples may be identified and associated with the test order by rack ID and sample ID,
or by rack position.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The analyzer sample handler manages and routes the racks for processing samples. After
loading racks, the loading door is closed, which triggers the rack transfer for sample
processing. When a rack is transferred to the sample dispensing lane for a given analyzer
module, the analyzer sample probe aspirates samples from the sample container and
dispenses it into the reaction vessel (immunoassay module) or cuvette (chemistry module).
The sample probe is rinsed at a probe wash station between each sample dispense.
4. Calibration:
Calibrations either pass or fail according to the calibration acceptance criteria that are defined
in the calibration parameters for a given test. When a calibration passes, the calibration result
becomes the active calibration for processing samples. A calibration remains active for the
duration of the calibration stability period, at the end of which the point of calibration expires
K242190 - Page 3 of 10

--- Page 4 ---
and can no longer be used to calculate results. The analyzer alerts the user when calibration
tasks are due. For the Access Cortisol assay, calibration is required every 28 days.
Since the DxC 500i Cortisol assay is sensitive to temperature the sponsor included the
following information in the labeling:
The DxC 500i cortisol assay is sensitive to temperature. The temperature sensitivity of the
DxC 500i cortisol assay was evaluated at 18oC, 23oC and 28oC. When the DxC 500i analyzer
is calibrated at 23oC, expect up to ±11% bias if patient samples are tested at temperature
different from calibration temperature. When calibrated at 18°C or 28°C, the estimated biases
could be greater. Therefore, ensure the ambient laboratory temperature is around 23°C ±2°C
at the time of calibration.
5. Quality Control:
The analyzer provides a quality control (QC) management system in the software to help the
user monitor test performance. The QC information (material lot, expiration, frequency, etc.,)
must be configured before a specific QC test can be run. The QC tests generate alerts based
on the rules that are configured for the control lot or test, which may signal the need for
further investigation. The analyzer orders QC tests automatically when the QC tests are due
based on the configured frequency. For the Access Cortisol assay, quality control materials
should be included in each 24-hour time period and should cover at least two levels of
analyte. More frequent use of controls or the use of additional controls is left to the discretion
of the user based on good laboratory practices or laboratory accreditation requirements and
applicable laws.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was conducted according to the CLSI guideline EP06 2nd Edition to assess
the linearity of the Access Cortisol assay on the DxC 500i Clinical Analyzer. Nine levels of
serum ranging from 0.11 to 72.0 µg/dL were prepared by mixing different proportions of a
high cortisol-containing serum sample pool and a low cortisol-containing serum sample pool.
The lowest sample was run in replicates of eight and all other samples were run in replicates
of four. Samples were tested on two instruments using two lots of reagent (one per
instrument) and one lot of calibrators. The data was analyzed using a linear regression model.
The deviation from linearity did not exceed 8%. The results support the claimed measuring
interval of 2.3 to 60.0 µg/dL.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical specificity was established in K050202.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
2.3 – 60 µg/dL
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
The measurand (cortisol) in the Access Cortisol Calibrators is traceable to USP reference
material. The method for value assignment is based on EN ISO 17511.
6. Detection Limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) studies
were conducted on the DxC 500i in general accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A2.
The data support LOB of 0.4 μg/dL, LOD of 0.4 μg/dL and LOQ of 0.8 μg/dL.
Due to thermal sensitivity of the DxC 500i Cortisol Assay, sample concentrations < 2.3
μg/dL) will not be reported by the analyzer. The 20% CV criteria for LoQ was met at a
cortisol concentration of 2.3 μg/dL.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Not applicable.

F Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data:
Information was provided that demonstrated adequate instrument and assay performance. The
following thermal sensitivity information for the DxC 500i Clinical Analyzer are included in the
packet insert for the Access Cortisol.
Thermal Sensitivity:
The DxC 500i cortisol assay is sensitive to temperature. The temperature sensitivity of the DxC
500i cortisol assay was evaluated at 18oC, 23oC and 28oC. When the DxC 500i analyzer is
calibrated at 23oC, expect up to ±11% bias if patient samples are tested at temperature different
from calibration temperature. When calibrated at 18°C or 28°C, the estimated biases could be
greater. Therefore, ensure the ambient laboratory temperature is around 23°C ±2°C at the time of
calibration.
The following are observations from studies with Patient Samples:
The following thermal bias estimates were observed with patient specimens at representative
concentrations across the analytical measuring interval including medical decision levels.19, 20
The bias estimates were calculated using Passing-Bablok regression analysis applied separately
to the concentration intervals < 12 µg/dL (331 nmol/L) and =12 µg/dL (331 nmol/L).
