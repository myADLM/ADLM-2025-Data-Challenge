For In Vitro Diagnostic Use
Viewer+ is a software only device intended for viewing and management of digital images of
scanned surgical pathology slides prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)
tissue. It is an aid to the pathologist to review, interpret and manage digital images of pathology
slides for primary diagnosis. Viewer+ is not intended for use with frozen sections, cytology, or
non-FFPE hematopathology specimens.
It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate procedures and safeguards
to assure the quality of the images obtained and, where necessary, use conventional light
microscopy review when making a diagnostic decision. Viewer+ is intended for use with
Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner and BARCO MDPC-8127 display.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Viewer+, version 1.0.1, is a web-based software device that facilitates the viewing and
navigating of digitized pathology images of slides prepared from FFPE-tissue specimens
acquired from Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner and viewed on BARCO MDPC-
8127 display. Viewer+ renders these digitized pathology images for review, management, and
navigation for pathology primary diagnosis.
Viewer+ is operated as follows:
1. Image acquisition is performed using the NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner according
to its Instructions for Use. The operator performs quality control of the digital slides per
the instructions of the NanoZoomer and lab specifications to determine if re-scans are
necessary.
2. Once image acquisition is complete and the image becomes available in the scanner’s
database file system, a separate medical image communications software (not part of the
device) automatically uploads the image and its corresponding metadata to persistent cloud
storage. Image and data integrity checks are performed during the upload to ensure data
accuracy.
3. The subject device enables the reading pathologist to open a patient case, view the images,
and perform actions such as zooming, panning, measuring distances and areas, and
annotating images as needed. After reviewing all images for a case, the pathologist will
render a diagnosis.
Viewer+ operates with and is validated for use with the components specified the tables below:

B Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Viewer+
2. Specimen Identification:
Viewer+ uses digital pathology images obtained from the Hamamatsu NanoZoomer
S360MD Slide scanner of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained glass slides. The reading
pathologist selects a case (patient) from a worklist (within the device or external to the
device) whereby the subject device fetches the associated images from the external image
storage. The scanned images are identified based on the previously assigned specimen
identifier such as the laboratory specimen accession number.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling and handling are performed upstream and independent of the use of the
subject device. Specimen sampling includes biopsy or resection specimens which are
processed using histology techniques. The FFPE tissue section is Hematoxylin and Eosin
(H&E) stained. Digital images are then obtained from these glass slides using the
Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner.

5. Quality Control:
The scanning technician should perform quality control of all glass slides following the
instructions. Upon scanning, quality control should be performed on all digital slide images
following procedures defined by the scanner manufacturer prior to import into Viewer+. The
pathologist should review all images to ensure that all expected slides have been imported by
viewing the thumbnails and labels, and manually verifying the tissue specimen, block, and
staining information is present.

Technical performance testing was conducted with the subject device, Viewer+ as specified
below.
1. Bench Testing – Pixelwise comparison test
Pixel-wise comparison testing to demonstrate identical image reproduction was conducted to
compare WSIs reproduced by the subject device and the comparators as listed in Table 3
below. The subject device was compared to the predicate device’s image review
manipulation software (IRMS, as defined in FDA guidance document, “Technical
Performance Assessment of Digital Pathology Whole Slide Imaging Devices” dated April 20,
2016) using the quantitative pixel-wise comparison method. The basis for the comparison
was the CIEDE2000 color difference equation, ΔE . The devices were tested as operating
00
with the intended components, including the scanner, specific file format, image management
systems (subject device with the intended browsers, comparator [predicate device IRMS])
and display, as specified in the Table 3 below.
For each of the 4 configurations in Table 3 below, the device was tested with multiple slides
across multiple regions of interest (ROI) at multiple magnification levels. A total of 30 H&E-
stained, FFPE glass slides of normal and tumor tissues from various human anatomical
organs were used in the testing. The glass slides were scanned on a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer
S360MD Slide scanner to obtain 30 WSIs. For each of the 30 WSIs, 3 ROIs were selected by
qualified personnel to represent various features in the tissue samples. Each ROI was
captured at 3 magnification levels (10x, 20x, 40x).
K242244 - Page 6 of 9

--- Page 7 ---
The screenshots were captured from the intended display while viewing with the subject
device and predicate device IRMS. The screenshots were cropped and registered to be
pixelwise comparable. The cropped image included most of the pixels in the image except
for those in the viewer-specific user interface areas.
For each configuration, two sets of images were collected: comparator (predicate device
IRMS) and the subject device (Viewer+ with the intended browser). Each image set included
270 images that covered all combinations of 30 slides, 3 ROIs, and 3 magnification levels.
The testing data, including the overview images of the 30 glass slides with annotations of the
ROIs, registration/cropping information, and captured images, were provided in the FDA
specific format.
The comparator (predicate device IRMS) image set was used as the reference to compare the
subject device image set to determine whether all the 270 image-pairs were identical for each
configuration. Two images are considered identical if the 95th percentile of the pixelwise
differences, computed using the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) color
difference metric CIEDE2000 (ΔE00), is less than 3 ΔE . Testing results showed that the
00
pixelwise differences across all 270 image-pairs per configuration were less than 3 ΔE . The
00
maximum (max), minimum (min), and mean of the 95th percentile ΔE00 value were reported
in Table 3. Testing results demonstrated that WSIs reproduced by Viewer+ are identical to
images reproduced by the predicate device.

2. Turnaround Time
The turnaround time for image loading, panning and zooming were tested in the subject
device when using the 4 supported browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla
Firefox, and Apple Safari) over different magnifications levels and over multiple fields of
view (FOVs). Test results for different scenarios met the test acceptance criteria and showed
acceptable turnaround time for the intended use of the subject device, as shown in table 4
below.

3. Measurement – distance and area
Measurement accuracy testing was performed to demonstrate that Viewer+ represents length
and areal measurements accurately across multiple magnification levels. Four biological
glass slides were scanned on Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide scanner, and then
measured by qualified medical professionals using the Hamamatsu NZViewMD software and
Viewer+ measurement tools on the supported Barco MDPC-8127 display. A randomized set
of tests is chosen to test 4 biological glass slide images, 4 supported browsers (Google
Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari), 4 rotations, 4 zooms, 2
directions, and 2 types of measurements (length and areal). The intended and reported
metrics were recorded for each annotation. The differences between intended and reported
measurements were calculated, as summarized below in Table 5. Acceptance criteria was set
at +/- 0.1mm of pathologist annotation for length, and +/- 0.1mm2 for area measurements.
Test results showed that the acceptance criteria were met, and the subject device performed
accurate measurements of length across multiple magnification settings with respect to its
intended use.
