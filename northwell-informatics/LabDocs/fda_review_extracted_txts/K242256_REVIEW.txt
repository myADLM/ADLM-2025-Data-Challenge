III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The QIAstat-Dx Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) Panel is a qualitative multiplexed nucleic acid
real-time PCR based in vitro diagnostic test intended for use with the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0.
The QIAstat-Dx ME Panel is capable of simultaneous detection and identification of multiple
bacterial, viral, and yeast nucleic acids from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens obtained via
lumbar puncture from individuals with signs and/or symptoms of meningitis and/or encephalitis.
The following organisms are identified using the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel: Enterovirus,
Escherichia coli K1, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis
(encapsulated), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes,
and Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii*.
The QIAstat-Dx ME Panel is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of meningitis
and/or encephalitis and results must be used in conjunction with other clinical, epidemiological,
and laboratory data. Results from the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel are not intended to be used as the
sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions. Positive results do not
rule out co-infection with organisms not included in the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel. The agent or
agents detected may not be the definite cause of the disease. Negative results do not preclude
central nervous system infection.
Not all agents of central nervous system infection are detected by this test and sensitivity in
clinical use may differ from that described in the instructions for use.
The QIAstat-Dx ME Panel is not intended for testing specimens collected from indwelling
central nervous system medical devices.
The QIAstat-Dx ME Panel is intended to be used in conjunction with standard of care culture for
organism recovery, serotyping, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
*Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are not differentiated.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The QIAstat-Dx ME Panel assay is intended for use with the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0
instrument, which was originally cleared in K183597.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
QIAstat-Dx ME Panel
K242256 - Page 2 of 35

--- Page 3 ---
The QIAstat-Dx ME Panel is a single use plastic device which contains wet and dry reagents to
allow automated extraction and reverse-transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR) for use in the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 instrument. All reagents required to
perform the test are pre-loaded on the cartridge, the microfluidics system is pneumatically
operated preventing reagents within the cartridge from contracting the user or analyzer actuators.
Within the cartridge, multiple steps are automatically performed in sequence by using pneumatic
pressure and a multiport valve to transfer sample and fluids via the transfer chamber to the
intended destinations.
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 Instrument
The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 instrument hosts the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel cartridge and runs
predefined assay protocols by use of pneumatic pressure and a multiport valve.
Interpretation of Results
The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 instrument automatically interprets and saves test results. After
ejecting the cartridge, the results summary screen is automatically displayed. Detected analytes
(i.e., positive results) are displayed at the top of the list under the category ‘Detected’ in red font
with a plus sign (+) next to the name. The last section of the results screen shows all targets
tested with either a plus sign if it was detected or a minus sign (-) with the name in green colored
font if the analyte was tested but not detected.
Quality Control
The QIAstat-Dx ME Panel includes a titered lyophilized MS2 bacteriophage internal control (IC)
that provides verification that all analysis steps including sample resuspension, lysis, nucleic acid
purification, reverse transcription, and PCR were successful. The results screen displays a
message indicating that the internal controls “Passed” when the test was run successfully. A
message of “Failed” indicates that the internal control was not amplified; ‘Positive’ test results
are still reported as positive, but all ‘Negative’ results are invalid. Positive and negative external
controls are recommended by the manufacturer but are not provided.
B Principle of Operation:
Once the cartridge has been inserted into the instrument, the test starts automatically and runs for
approximately 80 minutes. When the test is finished, the cartridge is removed by the user and
discarded. The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 instrument automatically interprets test results and
displays a summary on the analyzer display screen. The results can be printed using a connected
printer, if needed.
The collection of specimens and their subsequent loading into the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel
cartridge should be performed by personnel trained in safe handling of biological samples. The
user collects the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen and loads 200 µL of sample into the main
port of the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel. All remaining steps through results interpretation and display
are completed automatically by the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 instrument.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Inclusivity
a. The Inclusivity (analytical reactivity) study extended the list of pathogen strains tested
during the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel Limit of Detection (LoD) study to confirm the
reactivity of the detection system in the presence of different strains of the same
organisms at a concentration near or above the respective LoD.
A variety of clinically relevant strains of each target organism of the QIAstat-Dx ME
Panel representing organism sub-types, strains, serotypes, and genotypes of different
temporal and geographic diversity of each analyte were included in the study. Analytical
reactivity was assessed with both in vitro wet-testing and in silico analysis.
A total of 130 strains covering 10 different analytical strains for each targeted organism
or relevant species were tested as described in Table 1 below.

To make assay reactivity predictions of all primers-probe oligonucleotide sequences included
in the panel against publicly available sequence databases to detect any possible cross-
reaction or unexpected detection of any primer set, in silico analysis was performed. In
addition, strains not available for in vitro testing were included in in silico analysis to
confirm the predicted inclusivity of the different strains of the same organisms (Table 3).

2. Precision/Reproducibility:
a. Multi-site Reproducibility Study
Reproducibility of the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel assay was evaluated at three different sites
(one internal, two external) using three blinded panels (Table 4) representing a subset of
targets detected by the assay. The study evaluated positive samples (artificial CSF spiked
with selected pathogens) containing analytes at both 1X LoD and 3X LoD concentrations
as well as negative samples (artificial CSF). Testing occurred over 5 non-consecutive
days with each sample evaluated in two replicates/site/day. The study also included 13
operators across the three study sites and a total of 4 cartridge lots.
A total of 90 replicates per target were tested at each concentration evaluated. Samples
were prepared in bulk, divided into single-use aliquots, and stored frozen at -80°C or
below until usage. Samples were evaluated for expected reactivity before inclusion in the
study.

• 3x LoD: the observed proportion of positive calls must be ≥96.7% (87 / 90) (95%
CI: 90.6%-99.3%).
• 1x LoD: the observed proportion of positive calls must be ≥90.0% (81 / 90) (95%
CI: 81.9%-95.3%).
• Negative: The proportion of negative results must be ≥96.7% (87 / 90) (
95% CI: 90.6%-99.3%).
Raw data interpretation and results reporting were automatically done by the Operational
Module Application Software and the Assay Definition File (ADF) that is installed in the
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 instrument.
At 3x LoD concentration, all targets gave 100% correct calls. At 1x LoD concentration,
all targets gave 100% correct calls, except for Listeria monocytogenes (Table 5). All
negative samples returned a negative call 100% of the time. The study results were
acceptable and demonstrate appropriate reproducibility of the assay.

3. Linearity:
Not applicable. The device is a qualitative assay.
4. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
a. Analytical Specificity (Cross-Reactivity)
The analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated using both in vitro wet-testing and in
silico analysis to assess the potential cross-reactivity and exclusivity of the QIAstat-Dx
ME Panel. On-panel organisms were tested to assess the potential for intra-panel cross-
reactivity and off-panel organisms were tested to evaluate cross-reactivity with organisms
not covered by the panel (panel exclusivity). Off-panel organisms were selected due to
being known to colonize the central nervous system or cause meningitis and/or
encephalitis symptoms, are common skin flora or laboratory contaminants, are
genetically similar to on-panel analytes, or are microorganisms for which much of the
population may have been infected.
Samples were prepared by spiking potential cross-reactive organisms (Table 6) into
artificial CSF matrix (see Section B.2. for matrix comparison) at 105 TCID /mL for viral
50
targets, 106 CFU/mL for fungi/yeast target, and 106 CFU/mL for bacterial and fungi/yeast
target, or the highest concentration possible based on the organism stock.
All on-panel pathogens evaluated in the study resulted in specific detection, and all off-
panel pathogens tested showed a negative result with no cross-reactivity was observed
except for the pathogens shown in Table 6 below.

In silico analysis was also performed for the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel primer/probe designs
in two steps to further characterize the sequence specificity of the RT-PCR assays to
detect possible unspecific homologies and/or unspecific cross-reactions.
The result of the analysis identified six potential cross-reactive off-panel targets (Table
8).

*Potential cross-reactivity was not confirmed by in vitro wet-testing.
b. Interfering Substances:
An interference study was conducted to evaluate whether assay performance was affected
by commonly encountered interfering substances (Table 9). The substances tested in the
study (21) included endogenous as well as exogenous substances that are commonly
found and/or introduced into CSF specimens during collection.
All QIAstat-Dx ME Panel target organisms were tested at 3x LoD in artificial CSF matrix
and testing was performed in triplicate. Potential interfering substances were spiked into
the samples at high concentrations intended to reflect worst case concentrations
encountered in clinical samples.

c. Microbial Interference/Competitive Inhibition:
A study was conducted to evaluate whether high concentrations of viruses (105 units/mL)
or bacteria (106 CFU/mL) could impact assay performance. Briefly, non-target organisms
(Table 10) were individually mixed with artificial CSF matrix containing one of the four
spiked targeted QIAstat Dx ME Panel organism mixes (3x LoD) (Table 11). Testing was
performed in triplicate.

Not applicable. The device is a qualitative assay.
6. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
a. Assay Controls
i. Internal Controls:
The QIAstat-Dx ME Panel includes an Internal Control, which is titered
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a yeast (fungi) that is included in the cartridge in dried
form and is rehydrated upon sample loading. This Internal Control material verifies
all steps of the analysis process, including sample homogenization, lysis of viral and
cellular structures (by means of chemical and mechanical disruption), nucleic acid
purification, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR.
A positive signal for the Internal Control indicates that all processing steps performed
by the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel were successful.
A negative signal of the Internal Control does not negate any positive results for
detected and identified targets, but it does invalidate all negative results in the
analysis. Therefore, the test should be repeated if the Internal Control signal is
negative.
ii. Recommended External Control:
All external quality control testing should be performed in accordance with local,
state, and federal regulations or accreditation organizations and should follow the
laboratory standard quality control procedures.
Control materials are not provided with the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel.

b. Sample Stability
A sample stability study was conducted to demonstrate that clinical cerebrospinal fluid
specimens may be stored at room temperature (15 to 25ºC) for up to twenty-four hours, at
refrigerated conditions (2 to 8ºC) for up to seven days or in the freezer (-15 to -25ºC) and
(-60ºC to -90ºC) for up to two and four months, respectively, before testing with the
QIAstat-Dx ME Panel without affecting the performance.
Positive samples used in this study were prepared in clinical negative CSF matrix spiked
with targets at 2.5x LoD concentration (Table 12). At least three small pools of clinical
matrix were used for sample preparation. Pathogen-negative samples without added
pathogens were not assessed in this study since negative results from the non-spiked
targets have been analyzed. Samples were prepared in bulk and divided into single
aliquots that were tested after specific storage conditions.

Right after sample preparation, at least twenty replicates of each sample were tested as a
referenced condition (T0). The rest of the prepared aliquots were then stored and tested.
Each storage condition was considered suitable for storage if all spiked pathogens at 2.5x
LoD generated a detection rate of ≥95% (≥19/20) of the tested aliquots per storage
condition and, additionally, all pathogens not included in the respective sample resulted
in a negative signal.
All panel analytes included in Sample Mixes 1, 2 and 3 passed the study acceptance
criteria indicating a true positive agreement of at least 95% for all time points assessed
except for Neisseria meningitidis (ATCC; 13090) in Sample Mix 2, which showed a
detection rate <95% (18/20) at 121 days (-60ºC to -90ºC). An investigation was
conducted to assess the Ct drift of Neisseria meningitidis (ATCC; 13090) across the
different timepoints (including T0) for the storage condition -60ºC to -90ºC. Results of
this analysis showed that the regression line for this target was well within the allowable
drift limit and was deemed to be statistically stable at all the timepoints assessed at the
storage condition -60ºC to -90ºC. Therefore, Neisseria meningitidis test results at 121
days (-60ºC to -90ºC) were accepted.

A detection rate of <95% was observed for Enterovirus at 31 days. Investigation
concluded cartridges used for Enterovirus exceeded their shelf life. Results obtained
during subsequent timepoints passed acceptance criteria.
Data from the study was adequate to support the storage claims included in the labeling.
The results of this study support claims for storage of cerebrospinal fluid for 24 hours at
15-25°C or refrigerated for up to seven days at 2-8°C prior to testing samples with the
QIAstat-Dx ME Panel. No claim for use of frozen specimens was included in the
Package Labeling.
c. Freeze/Thaw Study
A fresh vs frozen study was performed to demonstrate equivalent assay performance
when samples are frozen at -60˚C to -90˚C for at least 12 hours and subjected to 3 freeze-
thaw cycles prior testing and to support the use of frozen samples during the validation
studies.
For the fresh vs. frozen study, analytical samples were manufactured using organisms
from commercial suppliers (Table 15). Samples consisted of mixtures of organisms
spiked into pre-screened negative clinical CSF matrix at a final concentration of 5x LoD,
1x LoD and 0.1x LoD as defined by the Limit of Detection in Combined Samples.
Sample mixes were prepared in pools, divided into aliquots, and either immediately
tested (fresh) or frozen at -60˚C to -90˚C for at least 12 hours. Samples were frozen twice
with at least two hours between freeze/thaw cycles and then thawed again before testing
at each timepoint with the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel for a total of 3 freeze/thaw cycles.
Testing was conducted by a minimum of one operator using at least one lot of QIAstat-
Dx ME Panel on 3 or more QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 instruments and replicated as
described in Table 13.

Carryover
A carryover study was performed to evaluate the potential occurrence of cross-
contamination between consecutive runs when using the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel on the
QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0. Alternating CSF samples containing either high-positive (105–
106 organism/mL) or no organisms were evaluated on two QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0
instruments.
No carryover between samples was observed in the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel, demonstrating
that the system design and recommended sample handling and testing practices are
effective in preventing unexpected results due to carryover or cross-contamination
between samples.
7. Detection Limit:
Individual Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration at which ≥95% of samples generate a
positive result. Dilutions of 26 commercial pathogen strains (Table 15) were prepared using
artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Equivalence between the artificial CSF matrix and native CSF
matrix was established in a separate matrix equivalency study (see Section B.2).

i. Multi-Spiked Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD for each pathogen was assessed in multiple-spiked samples containing up to
five organisms to determine if multiple analytes in a single CSF sample during the
analytical studies for potential loss of detection when multiple targets are present in
clinical specimens (co-infections). Multiplexed samples were tested at 5x LoD, 1x LoD,
and 0.1x LoD concentrations following the LoDs established in the individual LoD
Study.
Samples consisting of three different organism mixes with up to five targeted organisms
each were compared to contrived single-spike samples for the following representative
panel analytes: bacterium (E. coli K1), yeast (C. neoformans), DNA virus (HSV-1), and
RNA virus (HPeV). All samples were prepared in a CSF matrix. Serial dilutions were
prepared for both single-spike samples and multiple spiked samples containing the
corresponding analyte for comparison.

All sample dilutions were prepared using artificial CSF. Testing was conducted over 3
days by different operators using at least 5 different QIAstat-Dx ME Panel lots on 3 or
more QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 instruments.
In addition to meeting the acceptance criteria for qualitative performance, there should be
no significant differences in assay metrics (i.e., Ct values) between samples prepared in
the individual and combined samples.

2. Matrix Comparison:
A matrix equivalency study was conducted to compare the performance of analytical samples
prepared in negative clinical cerebrospinal fluid (cCSF) matrix to sample prepared in
artificial CSF matrix (aCSF). A total of 26 pathogen strains (at least two different strains per
panel target) were tested in combined samples spiked in true-negative cCSF. Clinical CSF
was sourced from commercial suppliers and was tested prior to its use in mix manufacture
for true-negativity with either the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel or an alternative method.
Samples were prepared by spiking pathogens in multiplex sample mixes containing up to 5
organisms per sample in cCSF at 5x LoD, 1x LoD and 0.1x LoD concentrations following
the Limit of Detection in Combined Samples study (See Section 7.ii.). The concentration of
the pathogen strain that achieved a result around the detection limit (1x LoD) was assessed
by testing a minimum of 30 replicates; 5x LoD and 0.1x LoD concentrations were assessed
by testing a minimum of 10 replicates. Some pathogens required an additional round of
testing to establish the dilution to achieve LoD, in addition to the initial testing described.
Testing for each concentration was executed during at least 3 different days by different
operators using four different lots of QIAstat-Dx ME Panel cartridges executed on 3 or

more QIAstat-Dx Analyzers. Negative samples consisted of unspiked cCSF, and a minimum
of 10 replicates were tested.
To demonstrate equivalence, in addition to meeting the acceptance criteria for qualitative
performance, there should be no significant differences in assay metrics (i.e., Ct values). The
difference in mean target Ct values between the two sample matrix types, evaluated with an
ANOVA fitted test, will not be statistically significant when p-value >0.05. If statistically
significant, then the mean difference in Ct value of the combined sample in cCSF compared
to the combined samples in aCSF should be within ±2x SD of the combined sample in cCSF
to be deemed equivalent.
Of the 26 pathogen strains evaluated, the LoD concentration was equivalent between
combined (multi-spiked) samples in aCSF and cCSF in 17 strains. Nine pathogen strains
(Streptococcus pneumoniae (ZeptoMetrix 0801439), Streptococcus pyogenes (ZeptoMetrix
0804351), Enterovirus B (ZeptoMetrix 0810019CF), Enterovirus C (ATCC VR-583),
Enterovirus D (ATCC VR-1823)) were not equivalent and had a new LoD concentration
determined in cCSF.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Prospective Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the Qiagen QIAstat-Dx ME Panel to detect and identify target
bacteria, fungi, and viruses from cerebrospinal fluid samples was assessed in a multi-site
study using residual de-identified CSF samples. Testing was conducted across 13
geographically diverse sites (10 U.S. and 3 European) using residual cerebrospinal fluid
specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of meningitis and/or encephalitis.
Performance for the QIAstat-Dx ME Panel was compared to the predicate device, BioFire
FilmArray ME Panel except for the target not detected by the predicate device, Streptococcus
pyogenes, which were compared to PCR followed by bidirectional sequencing.
Testing of prospectively collected residual specimens occurred between March 2022 – March
2023. A total of 1737 specimens were enrolled with 205 withdrawn, most commonly for
ineligibility (not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria). To supplement results of the
prospective clinical study, frozen archived positive specimens were blinded and mixed with
prospective specimens at clinical sites. Contrived samples were assigned a unique blinded
specimen ID prior to being randomized and shipped to investigator sites along with negative
contrived samples.
Prior to testing at the clinical sites, prospective cerebrospinal fluid specimens were stored up
to 24 hours at room temperature (15-25°C), up to 7 days at 2-8°C, or frozen (≤-70°C ±20°C)
prior to testing. After comparator testing at the study site, all specimens were frozen (≤-70°C
±20°C) and stored before being shipped to central testing sites for additional comparator
testing or discordance testing, if required. Discordant results were analyzed using Standard of
Care (SoC) culture when sufficient sample volume remained.
K242256 - Page 27 of 35

The study inclusion criteria included the following:
• Sites were advised to make best effort to provide unique specimens (only one sample
per patient).
• Specimens must have met the laboratory testing criteria for individuals with signs
and/or symptoms of meningitis and/or encephalitis. Specimens consisting of only
CSF obtained via lumbar puncture were collected.
• Specimens were residual and should not have undergone more than three (3)
freeze/thaw cycles.
• Minimum 500 μL of residual volume.
• Fresh specimens should be stored at 2-8°C for 7 days. Ship within to testing sites
within 48 hours of collection (for testing at sponsor site / testing site within total 72
hours post collection). Frozen specimens should be stored at -70°C (±20°C) up to 2
months.
The study exclusion criteria included the following:
• Specimens not fitting inclusion criteria outlined above
• Cerebrospinal fluid obtained from an external ventricular drain or shunt source
• Specimen has been centrifuged
• Obvious physical damage of banked residual specimen
• Repeat specimens from the same subject

a For the prospective fresh Escherichia coli K1 discordant sample, no organisms were detected with PCR/BDS. For
the frozen Escherichia coli K1 discordant sample no organisms were detected with bacterial culture.
b For the prospective fresh Haemophilus influenzae discordant sample, no organisms were detected by the SoC
bacterial culture and testing with PCR/BDS. Of the three (3) false positive Haemophilus influenzae samples, no
organisms were detected in one fresh and one frozen by SoC culture and PCR/BDS was also negative. No additional
testing results associated with the final frozen false positive sample were available.
c For the frozen Listeria monocytogenes discordant sample the negative result was confirmed positive with SoC
culture and LDT result was positive.
d For the frozen Neisseria meningitidis (encapsulated) sample, no organisms were detected by SoC culture and LDT
testing with PCR/BDS also returned a negative result for this sample.
e Of the five (5) false positive Streptococcus pneumoniae samples, no organisms were detected in four (3 fresh and 1
frozen) prospective samples with SoC culture. One prospective frozen sample had no SoC result available. However,
an FDA cleared method conducted as part of the study also produced a negative result.
f For the prospective fresh Enterovirus discordant samples, no organisms were detected in one sample by two
independent SoC LDT assays. The negative result for the second sample returned a negative result with PCR/BDS. For
the prospective fresh false positive Enterovirus sample, a negative result was returned when tested with PCR/BDS.
g Of the three false negative Cryptococcus gattii / Cryptococcus neoformans (not differentiated) results, no organisms
were detected in two fresh samples with fungal culture and PCR/BDS. The remaining false negative fresh sample was
confirmed negative for Cryptococcus gattii / Cryptococcus neoformans (not differentiated) with PCR/BDS. Of the
two false positive results, no organisms were detected for one fresh sample with PCR/BDS. No organisms were
detected in the second fresh sample with SoC fungal culture.

3. Contrived Samples
Contrived specimens were prepared for each target. Streptococcus pyogenes was not
observed in the prospective study and is supported solely with contrived samples. Contrived
samples were prepared by spiking five quantified strains representative of the genetic
diversity of each pathogen (Table 21) at a concentration of 2x and 5x LoD in negative
cerebrospinal fluid. Contrived specimens were mixed with prospective specimens, stored at -
70°C (±20°C), and tested in batches as received by the clinical testing sites. It was not
possible to test contrived samples alongside prospective samples for 676 samples. An equal
number of negative samples were randomly mixed with the prepared samples to maintain
blinded conditions.
