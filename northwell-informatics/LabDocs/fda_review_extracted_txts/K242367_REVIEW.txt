C Type of Test:
A multiplexed nucleic acid-based test intended for use with the FilmArray 2.0 System or the
Torch System for the qualitative in vitro detection and identification of multiple bacteria, viruses,
and parasites. The BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel assay is performed directly from stool
samples in Cary Blair transport media.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The BIOFIRE FILMARRAY Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel is a qualitative multiplexed nucleic
acid-based in vitro diagnostic test intended for use with BIOFIRE FILMARRAY Systems. The
BIOFIRE GI Panel is capable of the simultaneous detection and identification of nucleic acids
from multiple bacteria, viruses, and parasites directly from stool samples in Cary Blair transport
media obtained from individuals with signs and/or symptoms of gastrointestinal infection. The
following bacteria (including several diarrheagenic E. coli/Shigella pathotypes), parasites, and
viruses are identified using the BIOFIRE GI Panel:
• Campylobacter (C. jejuni/C. coli/C. upsaliensis)
• Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin A/B
• Plesiomonas shigelloides
• Salmonella
• Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus/V. vulnificus/ V. cholerae), including specific identification of
Vibrio cholerae
• Yersinia enterocolitica
• Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC)
• Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC)
• Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) lt/st
• Shiga-like toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) stx1/stx2 (including specific identification
of the E. coli O157 serogroup within STEC)
• Shigella/ Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC)
• Cryptosporidium
• Cyclospora cayetanensis
K242367 - Page 2 of 16

--- Page 3 ---
• Entamoeba histolytica
• Giardia lamblia (also known as G. intestinalis and G. duodenalis)
• Adenovirus F 40/41
• Astrovirus
• Norovirus GI/GII
• Rotavirus A
• Sapovirus (Genogroups I, II, IV, and V)
The BIOFIRE GI Panel is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of
gastrointestinal illness and results are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical,
laboratory, and epidemiological data. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with organisms
not included in the BIOFIRE GI Panel. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of the
disease.
Concomitant culture is necessary for organism recovery and further typing of bacterial agents.
This device is not intended to monitor or guide treatment for C. difficile infection.
Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during the
prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for E. coli O157, Plesiomonas
shigelloides, Yersinia enterocolitica, Astrovirus, and Rotavirus A were established primarily
with retrospective clinical specimens.
Performance characteristics for Entamoeba histolytica, and Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus, V.
vulnificus, and Vibrio cholerae) were established primarily using contrived clinical specimens.
Negative BIOFIRE GI Panel results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with
gastroenteritis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or non-
infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease.
A gastrointestinal microorganism multiplex nucleic acid-based assay also aids in the detection
and identification of acute gastroenteritis in the context of outbreaks.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
The BIOFIRE FILMARRAY Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel is to be used with the BIOFIRE 2.0
System or BIOFIRE Torch System.

A Device Description:
The BIOFIRE FILMARRAY Gastrointestinal Panel (BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel) was
originally cleared in K140407.
The BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel is a qualitative multiplexed nucleic acid-based in vitro
diagnostic test intended for use with BIOFIRE FILMARRAY systems. The BIOFIRE
FILMARRAY GI Panel is capable of the simultaneous detection and identification of nucleic
acids from multiple bacteria, viruses, and parasites directly from stool samples in Cary Blair
transport media obtained from individuals with signs and/or symptoms of gastrointestinal
infection.
B Principle of Operation:
The principle of operation remains unchanged from the original clearance (K140407). Refer to
the original published decision summary for specific details on the principle of operation of the
device.
In response to a perceived elevated rate of BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel Norovirus GI/GII
false positive results from customers, post-market analytical and clinical investigations were
conducted to assess potential cross-reactivities of the Norovirus GI/GII assay and to provide an
updated assessment of the Norovirus assay clinical performance.

VI Standards/Guidance Documents Referenced:
FDA-recognized Standards
• ISO 14971:2019 ‘Medical devices – Application of risk management to medical devices’
• ISO 15223-1:2021 ‘Medical devices – Symbols to be used with information to be
supplied by the manufacturer – Part 1: General requirements
VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was previously performed for the BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel
performance in the original clearance (K140407) and in additional subsequent regulatory
submissions (K143005, K160459, and K230404). Please refer to the published decision
summaries for additional information. Since there is no change to the assay, instrument, or
software, and a new reproducibility study was not conducted.
2. Linearity:
The BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel is a qualitative assay and therefore linearity studies
are not applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical specificity and interfering substances studies were performed for the original
BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel performance evaluation (K140407). Please refer to the
published decision summary for additional information.
Additional analytical specificity testing was performed to evaluate the reactivity of the
BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel Norovirus GI/GII assay (and other Panel assays) with
multiple bacterial organisms identified in post-market investigations of false positive
Norovirus GI/GII results in clinical specimens. Sequence data recovered from BIOFIRE
FILMARRAY GI Panel pouch arrays suspected of false positive Norovirus GI/GII results
were analyzed and aligned to sequences of a variety of commensal bacteria from the human
gastrointestinal tract, including Mediterraneibacter (Ruminococcus) gnavus, Enterobacter
hormaechei, Anaerostipes hadrus, Parabacteroides merdae, Parabacteroides distasonis,
Blautia wexlerae, Prevotella sp. (P. bivia, P. copri, P. histicola, and P. intermedia) and
Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. Both wet-testing of isolates and in silico analysis
approaches were used to evaluate cross reactivity of these organisms with the Norovirus
GI/GII assay and other Panel assays.

Isolate Wet Testing
Wet testing of organism isolates followed the general procedure used for Analytical
Specificity testing in the original clearance for the BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel
(K140407). Isolates were prepared and tested at concentrations >1.0E+08 cells/mL in
triplicate (one replicate using one of three different reagent lots). Initial positive results for
any replicate were followed by at least two additional replicates to determine whether the
result was reproducible. Norovirus GI/GII Detected results (Noro 1 assay positive) were
reported in at least 1/3 or 2/5 replicates at the initial high concentration for
Mediterraneibacter (Ruminococcus) gnavus, Parabacteroides merdae, Anaerostipes hadrus
(one of two isolates), and Enterobacter hormaechei (one of two isolates). Norovirus GI/GII
Not Detected results were reported for all replicates of Parabacteroides distasonis,
Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Blautia wexlerae, all Prevotella sp., as well as one
of two isolates of each A. hadrus and E. hormaechei.
In silico Analysis
Amplicon sequences recovered from BIOFIRE FILMARRAY FILMARRAY GI Panel
pouches with suspected false positive Norovirus GI/GII results were matched to a reference
sequence for the best match species. The reference sequence was then used to search for
regions flanking the amplicon which might be used as sites for the Norovirus GI/GII assay
primer binding. Homology of assay primers with the predicted binding site was used to
predict the likelihood of amplification and detection.
Testing and in silico analysis concluded that Mediterraneibacter (Ruminococcus) gnavus and
Parabacteroides merdae are potentially cross-reactive species and present a risk of false
positive Norovirus GI/GII results if present in a specimen at very high concentration.
Additionally, predicted cross-reactive sequences were identified in a subset of genomes of
Anaerostipes hadrus and Enterobacter hormaechei (<35% and <25% of genomes,
respectively). Sequence in approximately 50% of the Parabacteroides distasonis genomes
can be amplified by a combination of outer and inner reaction primers, but in silico analyses
suggest a false positive result by the BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel is unlikely due to
exclusion by the assay Tm range. Tm range-based exclusion was also demonstrated for off-
target amplification of sequence in Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum mitigating the risk of
false results due to cross-reactivity with this organism. No risk of cross-reactivity/off-target
amplification could be identified for Blautia wexlerae based on sequence analysis or testing.
The analytical specificity study to support the original clearance of the BIOFIRE
FILMARRAY GI Panel evaluated Prevotella melaninogenica (a human commensal and
opportunistic pathogen). No cross-reactivity with P. melaninogenica was observed, however
internal investigations into potentially false positive Norovirus GI/GII results recovered
sequence from non-specific amplicons which, when submitted for BLAST analysis, aligned
to atypical Prevotella sp. In silico analyses of four additional Prevotella sp. (P. bivia, P.
copri, P. histicola, and P. intermedia) did not indicate non-specific amplification or
interaction with the Norovirus GI/GII assay. These results are consistent with the lack of any
observed cross-reactivity from wet-testing of these isolates. Results from the additional
cross-reactivity testing and in silico analyses (Tables 1 & 2) will be included in the updated
device labeling.

a Cross-reactivity was not observed when tested at high concentration (1.5×109 cells/mL). However, cross-reactivity
was suspected or confirmed in clinical specimens and/or the potential for cross-reactivity is supported by in silico
predictions.
b Cross-reactivity was identified by post-market investigation of suspected false positive Norovirus GI/GII results in
clinical specimens. Cross-reactivity with the species listed was confirmed by analytical testing at high concentration
(>2.4x108 cells/mL) and/or is supported by sequence analysis.
c Cross-reactive sequences are inconsistent with other Prevotella sequence data, suggesting non-specific interaction
with atypical or uncharacterized species and/or sequences.
d P. acidifaciens was not tested but was determined by sequence analysis to have a similar risk of cross-reactivity as
P. merdae.
e Norovirus GI/GII Not Detected was reported when P. distasonis was tested at high concentration (3.1x109
cells/mL). However, non-specific amplification products with Tm values close to the assay specific Tm range have
been observed and the potential for false positive Norovirus GI/GII test results exists.
f The risk of false positive Norovirus GI/GII results due to cross-reactivity with A. hadrus is associated with only a
subset of A. hadrus RefSeq genome sequences (<35% as of June 2024).
g The risk of false positive Norovirus GI/GII results due to cross-reactivity with E. hormaechei is associated with
only a subset of E. hormaechei RefSeq genome sequences (<25% as of June 2024).
h Cross-reactivity resulting in false positive Salmonella results has not been observed in analytical or clinical testing.
However, non-specific amplification products with Tm values close to the assay specific Tm range have been
observed and the potential for false positive Salmonella test results exists.
i Detected at concentrations near the Vibrio assay LoD.
j Y. kristensenii and Y. fredericksenii are difficult to distinguish from Y. enterocolitica by standard laboratory

a Anerostipes hadrus isolates (DSM 23942 and ATCC 29173) were tested at >2.4×108 cells/mL. Norovirus GI/GII Detected
results were only observed with DSM 23942. The ATCC 29173 isolate does not carry the cross-reactive sequence.
b Though not observed in analytical testing, cross-reactivity of the Giardia lamblia assay with one or more Bifidobacterium and
Ruminococcus species was observed in the clinical evaluation (see Table 1).
c Though not observed in analytical testing, possible cross-reactivity of the ETEC 2 assay with Hafnia alvei and Cedecea
davisiae was observed in the clinical evaluation or predicted by in silico analysis (see Table 1).
d Two isolates of this species were tested for analytical specificity.
e Enterobacter hormaechei isolates (ATCC BAA-2082 and ATCC 49162) were tested at >5.0×108 cells/mL. Norovirus GI/GII
Detected results were only observed with ATCC 49162. The ATCC BAA-2082 sequence is not predicted to be cross-reactive by
in silico analysis.
f Though not observed in analytical testing, cross-reactivity of the Norovirus GI/GII assay with a sequence identified in roughly
half (~50%) of the P. distasonis genomes evaluated could occur at high concentration.
g A similar risk of cross-reactivity was identified with sequences annotated as Parabacteroides sp. and P. acidifaciens.
h No cross-reactivity with high concentrations of various Prevotella species (commensal and pathogenic) was observed in
analytical testing, but the potential for weak cross-reactivity between the Norovirus GI/GII assay and unique variant sequences
annotated as unculturable Prevotella sp. has been identified via investigation of discrepant results in clinical specimens.
i Though not observed in analytical testing, in silico analysis indicates that, similar to Y. kristensenii, cross-reactivity between the
Yersinia entercolitica assay and Yersinia fredericksenii is possible at high concentrations (see Table 1).
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel is a qualitative assay thus the assay reportable range
is not applicable.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
No changes were made to the assay, assay reagents, instrument, or assay software. For
additional information, please refer to the original published decision summary of K143005.

A limit of detection (LoD) study was performed to support the original BIOFIRE
FILMARRAY GI Panel (K140407). Since no changes were made to the assay, assay
reagents, instrument, or assay software, no new LoD study was conducted.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The BIOFIRE system evaluates DNA melting curve data rather than real-time PCR curves or
a measurement value (e.g. Ct values or RFU) to determine positive and negative results;
hence, the system does not utilize cut-offs as traditionally defined. For additional information
regarding the assay cut-offs refer to the published decision summary for the BIOFIRE
FILMARRAY GI Panel (K140407).

2. Clinical Specificity:
The BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel Norovirus GI/GII negative percent agreement (NPA)
was originally established in a prospective clinical study performed in 2013 to support the
original clearance of the device (K140407). These clinical study results for the Norovirus
GI/GII assay are summarized in Table 3 below.

Norovirus GI/GII 52/55 94.5 84.9-98.9% 1483/1501 98.8 98.1-99.3%
To evaluate potential risk of false positive results with the Norovirus GI/GII target, an
additional supplemental clinical study was conducted. The study was conducted with 872
fresh stool specimens collected and tested at three geographically distinct clinical sites within
the U.S. Patient demographic information from this study is summarized in Table 4 below.

Frozen aliquots of each specimen were tested at bioMerieux using the CDC CaliciNet
Norovirus GI/GII assay, the same Norovirus comparator assay used in the 2013 clinical
study. The use of frozen specimens was supported by a fresh vs. frozen equivalency study
conducted in the original submission (K140407). Of note, the current CDC CaliciNet
Norovirus GI/GII assay has been updated from the version used as the comparator in the
2013 clinical study. The updated assay includes new probe designs and quantification cycle
cut-off thresholds. Specimens used for comparator testing were randomized and blinded to
test operators. Testing with the BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel resulted in an apparent
detection rate for the Norovirus GI/GII assay of 7.2% (63/872). A comparison of the
BIOFIRE FILMARRAY GI Panel Norovirus GI/GII assay results with the comparator
method are summarized in Table 5.

Samples with discrepant results were further analyzed by an independent molecular method
and bidirectional sequencing. Investigation of the single false negative result from Table 3
showed evidence of Norovirus using the independent molecular method with bidirectional
sequencing. Additional investigation of the 29 false positives observed in the study indicated
evidence of Norovirus in three specimens. Sequences from various non-viral targets
(including Anaerostipes hadrus, Escherichia coli, Eubacterium sp., Homo sapiens, Jutongia
huaianensis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Parabacteroides distasonis, Parabacteroides merdae,
Prevotella sp., and Ruminococcus gnavus) was observed in 20 false positive specimens.
Several of these organisms were evaluated for cross-reactivity with BIOFIRE FILMARRAY
GI Panel by wet testing or in silico methods (see Tables 1 & 2). The cause of the six
remaining false positive specimens was suspected to be variable detection near or below the
LoD of the comparator assay or unexpected primer dimer amplification. While the observed
NPA results of in this supplemental clinical study indicated a minor decrease in the lower
