III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Dochek® Fentanyl Urine Test Strip is a competitive binding, lateral flow
immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of Fentanyl (FTY) in human urine at
the cut-off concentration of 1 ng/mL.
It is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) use. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The test provides only preliminary results. To obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more
specific alternative chemical method must be used. GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any
drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is positive.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
Dochek® Fentanyl Urine Test Strip, Dochek® Fentanyl Urine Test Strip Plus, Dochek®
Fentanyl Urine Test Card, Dochek® Fentanyl Urine Test Card Plus, Dochek® Fentanyl Urine
Test Cup and Dochek® Fentanyl Urine Test Cup Plus are immunochromatographic assays that
use a lateral flow system for the qualitative detection of fentanyl in human urine.
Test Strip, Test card and Test Cup use identical test strips made with same chemical formulation
and manufacturing procedures.
B Principle of Operation:
The Fentanyl (FTY) Test is an immunoassay based on the principle of competitive binding that
is used to screen for the presence of Fentanyl in urine. It is a chromatographic absorbent device
in which Fentanyl in a sample competitively combined to a limited number of antibody-dye
conjugate binding sites.
During testing, the urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. Fentanyl, if present in
the urine specimen below 1 ng/mL, will not saturate the binding sites of antibody-coated
particles in the test device. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized
FTY conjugate and a visible colored line will appear in the test region (T) to indicate a negative
result. The colored line will not appear in the test region (T) if the Fentanyl level exceeds 1
ng/mL because it will saturate all the binding sites of anti-FTY antibodies and prevent the
development of a distinct colored line, which indicating a positive result.
To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will always appear at the control region (C), if the
test has been performed properly.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision study was performed using drug-free specimens spiked with Fentanyl at different
concentrations: 0ng/mL, 0.25ng/mL, 0.5ng/mL, 0.75ng/mL, 1ng/mL, 1.25ng/mL, 1.5ng/mL,
1.75ng/mL, and 2ng/mL. All concentrations were confirmed with LC-MS/MS. The study
was performed 3 runs per day and lasted for 10 non-consecutive days by 6 laboratory
professionals using three different lots of Dochek® Fentanyl Urine Test Strip, Dochek®
Fentanyl Urine Test Card and Dochek® Fentanyl Urine Test Cup at the manufacturer site. 30
determinations were made for each concentration, and a total of 60 results were obtained per
concentration per lot.

80 clinical urine specimens were analyzed by LC/MS and by 3 lots of the corresponding
Dochek® Fentanyl Urine Test Strip, Dochek® Fentanyl Urine Test Card and Dochek®
Fentanyl Urine Test Cup. Samples were divided by concentration into five categories: drug
free, less than half the cutoff, near cutoff negative, near cutoff positive, and high positive.
The study was conducted by 3 laboratory professionals at the manufacturer site. Results were
as follows.

Lay User Study
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 980 lay persons. They had
diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 20 to 65 years.
Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations: 0ng/mL, 0.25 ng/mL
0.5ng/mL, 0.75ng/mL, 1.25ng/mL, 1.5ng/mL, 1.75ng/mL cutoff by spiking target drug
fentanyl into drug free urine specimens. The concentrations of samples were confirmed by
LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual containers, blind-labeled and
randomized. Each participant was provided with the English package insert, 1 blind labeled
sample, and a device. Results were as follows:
