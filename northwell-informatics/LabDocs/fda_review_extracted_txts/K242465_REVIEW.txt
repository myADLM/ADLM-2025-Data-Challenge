testing of AN swab specimens that are collected with the Hologic RespDirect Collection Kit and
eluted in eSTM media.
B Measurand:
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay detects SARS-CoV-2, influenza A,
influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus RNA isolated from NPS specimens and AN swab
specimens from individuals with signs and symptoms of a respiratory tract infection.
C Type of Test:
This assay is a multiplexed nucleic acid test that detects and differentiates SARS-CoV-2,
influenza A, influenza B, and RSV through nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection
using real-time RT-PCR. All steps of the assay are automated, after the manual addition of
sample into the sample lysis tube (SLT) and performed within the Panther and Panther Fusion
system.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is a fully automated multiplexed real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test intended for the qualitative
detection and differentiation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
influenza A virus (Flu A), influenza B virus (Flu B), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
Nucleic acids are isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens and anterior
nasal (AN) swab specimens obtained from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of a
respiratory tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection due to
SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV can be similar. This assay is intended to aid in the differential
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV infections in humans and is not intended to
detect influenza C virus infections.
Nucleic acids from the viral organisms identified by this test are generally detectable in NP and
AN swab specimens during the acute phase of infection. The detection and identification of
specific viral nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory tract
infection are indicative of the presence of the identified virus and aids in diagnosis if used in
conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information, and laboratory findings. The
results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient
management decisions.
Positive results do not rule out coinfection with other organisms. The organism(s) detected by
the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay may not be the definite cause of disease.
Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, or RSV
infections. This assay is designed for use on the Panther Fusion system.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is a multiplex real-time reverse
transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test developed for use on the fully automated.
Panther Fusion system to detect and differentiate SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) directly from nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal swab specimens.
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay cartridge contains the same sample
preparation and PCR reaction chemistry as the previously cleared Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay
(K171963). To accommodate addition of the SARS-CoV-2 reagents (primers/probes) to the
multiplexed reagents, minor changes were made to the previously cleared analyte primer/probe
concentrations and RFU cutoffs. Additionally, the fluorophore for Flu B was changed from ROX to
RED647 to accommodate the addition of SARS-CoV-2 to the assay.
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay involves the following steps:
a. Sample lysis - Prior to processing and testing on the Panther Fusion system, specimens are
transferred to a Specimen Lysis Tube (SLT) containing specimen transport media (STM).
Alternatively, samples can be collected with the RespDirect Collection kit which
contains enhanced specimen transport media (eSTM). STM and eSTM lyse the cells, release
target nucleic acid and protect them from degradation during storage.
b. Nucleic acid capture and elution - These steps take place in a single tube on the Panther Fusion
system. The eluate is transferred to the Panther Fusion system reaction tube containing the assay
reagents. The Internal Control-S (IC-S) is added to each test specimen and controls via the
working Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). The IC-S in the reagent is used to
monitor specimen processing, amplification, and detection. Magnetic particles with covalently
bound oligonucleotides mediate the nucleic acid capture. Capture oligonucleotides hybridize to
total nucleic acid in the test specimen. Hybridized nucleic acid is then separated from the lysed
specimen in a magnetic field. Wash and aspiration steps remove extraneous components debris
from the reaction tube. The elution step elutes purified nucleic acid.
c. Elution transfer and multiplex RT-PCR - Eluted nucleic acid is transferred to a Panther Fusion
reaction tube already containing oil and reconstituted master mix. A reverse transcriptase
generates a DNA copy of the target sequence. Target specific forward and reverse primers and
probes then amplify targets while simultaneously detecting and discriminating multiple target
types via multiplex RT-PCR. The Panther Fusion system compares the fluorescence signal to a
predetermined cut-off to produce a qualitative result for the presence or absence of the analyte.
The positive result for each analyte will be accompanied by the cycle threshold (Ct value).
Hologic RespDirect Collection Kit
An ancillary collection kit that consists of the RespDirect Swab, intended for collection of NP swab
and AN swab specimens, and the enhanced Direct Load Tube (eDLT), containing enhanced
specimen transport media (eSTM). This transport media lyses cells, releasing target nucleic acids and
protects them from degradation during storage.
K242465 - Page 3 of 15

--- Page 4 ---
B Principle of Operation:
The assay detects viral nucleic acids that have been extracted from a patient respiratory sample (i.e.,
NPS or AN swab specimens). A multiplex real-time RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized
conditions generating amplicons for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. The Internal
Control-S (IC-S) is added to each test specimen before processing to act as a control for specimen
processing, amplification, and detection. Identification of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B,
RSV, and the IC-S occurs using target-specific primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that hybridize
to conserved regions in the viral genomes (Table 1).

working Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S (wFCR-S). The IC-S is used to monitor
specimen processing, amplification, and detection.
Two external controls are also included with this assay in a single use vial, the Panther
Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV Positive Control and the Panther Fusion Negative
Control. The controls were validated in the analytical and clinical studies.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
Since the initial clearance of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay (K222736),
an Adaptive Crosstalk Correction (ACC) factor was implemented in the Assay Definition
Module (ADM) software (K241240). No further device modifications have been introduced.
For those studies originally performed in K222736 and subsequently in K241240, there have
been no device changes. Since there were no modifications to the assay (e.g., test reagent
formulation, software, etc.), it was unnecessary to repeat several of the studies performed in
support of K222736 or K241240. If a study was not repeated, a reference to where the results can
be found (i.e., publicly available K222736 and K241240 Decision Summaries) has been made.

1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Prospective Study to Expand the Intended Use to Include an AN swab specimens
collected using RespDirect Collection Kit in eSTM media Specimen Claim
The clinical performance of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was
established in a multi-center study conducted with two patient-matched paired AN swab
specimens that were prospectively collected (i.e., all comers between two time points who
meet the inclusion criteria) from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract
infections from January 2023 to May 2023. One AN swab specimen was collected using the
RespDirect Collection Kit with eSTM media for candidate device testing and the other AN
swab specimen was collected using a synthetic flocked swab by a healthcare professional
(HCP) and eluted in UTM/VTM for comparator testing. The collection order for candidate
and comparator specimens was randomized. AN swab specimens from nine geographically
diverse clinical sites in the U.S. were enrolled and tested fresh (Category I specimens) or
frozen (Category II specimens) with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay at
three U.S. testing sites.
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2
performance by comparing the candidate device testing results to a composite comparator
algorithm (CCA) consisting of three highly sensitive U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2
molecular tests. A final CCA result was assigned when two of the three comparator assays
were in concordance. The comparator method utilized to establish performance for the Flu A,
Flu B, and RSV targets was a U.S. FDA-cleared molecular Flu A/B/RSV assay. All
comparator testing was performed in accordance with the respective package inserts at one
central laboratory.
A total of 1033 subjects (each providing patient-matched paired AN swab specimens) were
acquired and enrolled for the prospective clinical study. Of these 1033 subjects, four were
withdrawn because they did not meet the study eligibility criteria, leaving 1029 subjects. Of
these 1029 subjects, 7 had their AN swab specimens excluded because they had an invalid
candidate device result upon retesting and one specimen was withdrawn because the incorrect
sample tube was used. Of the evaluable specimens, 1011 were test fresh (Category I
specimens) with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay and 10 were frozen
(Category II specimens) prior to testing. Furthermore, two specimens were excluded for
SARS-CoV-2 performance analysis due to invalid or inconclusive CCA results. This left
1019 prospective AN swab specimens (1009 fresh, 10 frozen) with evaluable results for
SARS-CoV-2 and 1021 AN swab specimens (1011 fresh, 10 frozen) with evaluable results
for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV.
K242465 - Page 10 of 15

--- Page 11 ---
Of the 1033 subjects enrolled in the study, 1032 had their AN swab specimens tested with the
candidate device. Eleven (11) of these specimens were invalid by the candidate device during
testing, for an initial invalid rate of 1.1% (11/1032). Upon retesting, the invalid rate
decreased to 0.7% (7/1032).

A summary of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay prospective clinical study
performance is provided in Table 3.
Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) was calculated as 100% × (TP / (TP + FN)). True positive
(TP) indicates that both the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay and the comparator
method had a positive result for the specific analyte, and false negative (FN) indicates that the
Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was negative while the comparator result was
positive. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was calculated as 100% × (TN / (TN + FP)). True
negative (TN) indicates that both the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay and the
comparator method had negative results, and false positive (FP) indicates that the Panther Fusion
SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay was positive while the comparator result was negative.
Specimens that obtained discordant results for SARS-CoV-2 underwent additional testing with
two U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, and discordant results for Flu A, Flu B or
RSV underwent additional testing with a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV molecular
test, when sufficient sample volume remained.

1Seven (7) specimens with false positive SARS-CoV-2 results had sufficient sample volume remaining for discordant
testing. All were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by two different U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests.
2The specimen with a false positive Flu A result was negative for Flu A by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV
molecular test.
3The specimen with a false negative Flu B result was negative for Flu B by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV
molecular test.
4Both specimens with false positive Flu B results were negative for Flu B by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV
molecular test.
5The specimen with a false positive RSV result was negative for RSV by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV
molecular test.
The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay reported one prospective, evaluable AN
swab specimen in eSTM (RespDirect) with a co-infection (0.1% of all prospective specimens,
1/1021). The co-infection contained two pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 and Flu B. The sample was
negative for all analytes by the comparator methods.
Data for prospective clinical study conducted with NP swab specimens and AN swab specimens
in UTM/VTM are presented in the Decision Summaries for K222736 and K241240.
Supplemental Clinical Data for Low Prevalence Analytes (Category III Specimens)
Flu A, Flu B and RSV were of lower prevalence and were not encountered in sufficiently
large numbers during the prospective clinical study to adequately demonstrate assay
performance with AN swab specimens collected with the RespDirect Collection Kit in eSTM
media. To supplement the results of the prospective clinical study, an enrichment phase of
the study was initiated which enrolled only symptomatic individuals who had obtained a Flu
A, Flu B and/or RSV positive molecular standard of care (SOC) test within five days of
enrollment. Enrichment occurred from October 2023- February 2024. One AN swab
specimen was collected using the RespDirect Collection Kit with eSTM media for candidate
device testing and the other AN swab specimen was collected using a synthetic flocked swab
by a healthcare professional (HCP) and eluted in UTM/VTM for comparator testing. The
collection order for candidate and comparator specimens was randomized. AN swab
specimens from six geographically diverse clinical sites in the U.S. were enrolled and frozen
prior to testing with the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay at one U.S. testing
site. The same U.S. FDA-cleared molecular Flu A/B/RSV assay was used as the comparator
method; SARS-CoV-2 was not evaluated during the enrichment phase of the study.
A total of 210 subjects (each providing patient-matched paired AN swab specimens) were
acquired and enrolled for the enrichment phase of the clinical study. Of these 210 subjects,
five were withdrawn because they did not meet the study eligibility criteria, and one
additional subject chose to withdraw from the study leaving a total of 204 evaluable AN
swab specimens in eSTM (RespDirect) from the enrichment phase.
Of the 210 subjects enrolled in the study, 205 had their AN swab specimens tested with the
candidate device. Two (2) of these specimens were invalid by the candidate device during

1All samples enrolled in the enrichment study were SOC positive for Flu A, Flu B, and/or RSV. The NPA for the enrichment
study was calculated using results from all evaluable samples with a negative comparator result for the analyte of interest.
2Both specimens with false negative Flu A results were positive for Flu A by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV
molecular test.
3One (1) of the 9 samples with a false positive Flu A results was positive for Flu A by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu
A/B/RSV molecular test and 8 of the 9 samples were negative for Flu A.
4The sample with a false negative Flu B result was negative for Flu B by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV
molecular test.

7One (1) of the 6 samples with a false positive RSV results was positive for RSV by a U.S. FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2/Flu
A/B/RSV molecular test and 5 of the 6 samples were negative for RSV.
As shown in Table 6, the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay reported 7
evaluable AN swab specimens in eSTM (RespDirect) in the enrichment phase with co-
infections (3.4% of all enriched specimens, 7/204). All co-infections contained two
pathogens, 4 contained Flu A and RSV, one contained SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A, one

results that were positive for Flu A and RSV, the comparator method did not detect RSV in
two of the samples. The U.S. FDA cleared molecular assay used for the comparator for Flu
A, Flu B and RSV does not detect SARS-CoV-2; therefore, co-infections detected by the
candidate device that contained SARS-CoV-2 could not be confirmed.
