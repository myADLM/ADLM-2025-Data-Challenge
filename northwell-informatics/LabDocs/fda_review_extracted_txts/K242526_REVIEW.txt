C Type of Test:
Qualitative RT-PCR
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test is a single-use (disposable), fully integrated,
automated Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) in vitro diagnostic test
intended for the simultaneous qualitative detection and differentiation of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A, and influenza B RNA in nasopharyngeal
swab and anterior nasal swab specimens from individuals with signs and symptoms of
respiratory tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection due to
SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B can be similar.
The Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test is intended for use as an aid in the differential
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B infection if used in conjunction with
other clinical and epidemiological information, and laboratory findings. SARS-CoV-2, influenza
A, and influenza B viral RNA are generally detectable in nasopharyngeal swab and anterior nasal
swab specimens during the acute phase of infection. This test is not intended to detect influenza
C virus infections.
Positive results are indicative of the presence of the identified virus, but do not rule out bacterial
infection or co-infection with other organisms not detected by the test. The agent(s) detected by
the Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test may not be the definitive cause of disease. Negative
results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, or influenza B infection. The results of this
test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management
decisions.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Single-use test without special instrument requirement.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test (referred to as “Visby Test” hereafter) is a single-use
(disposable), fully integrated, compact device containing a reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) based assay for qualitative detection and differentiation of RNA from
influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and
anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens.
K242526 - Page 2 of 20

--- Page 3 ---
The test system includes the Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test, the reusable Visby Medical
power adaptor, the Visby Medical Respiratory Health Buffer Tube, and fixed-volume transfer
pipette. Operators are instructed to collect the sample and elute it into the Visby Respiratory
Health Buffer.
A test operator transfers the collection media (containing patient specimen) into the sample port
of the device using the provided fixed-volume pipette and then slides a purple switch on the front
of the device to both close the sample port and initiate the fully automated testing process. The
device processes NPS and ANS samples by automatically performing all steps required to
complete lysis, reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction, and amplicon detection.
There are LED lights on the lower left corner of the device that are used to communicate the test
status. Stable white light in the shape of a power symbol will appear indicating the test is
plugged in. In addition, three progress lights to the right of the power light will each blink for
~10 minutes in sequence and then provide a stable white light to indicate the progression of the
test. At the conclusion of the test, a green LED under “DONE” next to the white lights signals
that the test run completed successfully.
When the run has completed, the operator visually interprets the status lights on the front of the
device and the colorimetric output in the detection window. A valid test will have both an
illuminated green LED under “DONE” and a purple spot adjacent to “RESULTS VALID” in the
detection window. For valid tests, a purple spot next to the name of a pathogen indicates a
positive result for that target.
In the case of a lack of a purple “RESULTS VALID” spot, the test is invalid, and the operator is
instructed to repeat the test. If the subsequent test is also invalid, the operator is instructed to
collect a new sample and repeat the test with a new device.
The device has built-in procedural controls. These include an internal process control and built-in
electronic control. The internal control is designed to ensure that all steps in the testing process
including reverse transcription, amplification of target sequences, and amplicon detection are
working properly. The electronic control monitors if device is being operated outside of its
temperature range or if there are any other device errors. The result of the internal process
control is displayed in the detection window while the results of the electronic controls are
displayed using the status lights.
Third-party external positive and negative controls are recommended for use with this test. These
controls are not provided with the device and must be purchased separately by the customer
directly from Microbiologics. The labeling states that the external controls “must be tested once
with each new shipment received and once for each untrained operator.”
B Principle of Operation:
The device houses all the reagents to perform the testing process. The sample enters a lysis
module and rehydrates the RT enzyme and RT primers. The mixture then moves through a
sample preparation module where viruses and human cells are simultaneously lysed, and RNA is
reverse transcribed. The resulting fluid (containing cDNA) is then mixed with lyophilized PCR
reagents containing the DNA polymerase enzyme and PCR primers. The PCR mixture
(containing cDNA template and reagents) is then thermal cycled to amplify the targets, including
K242526 - Page 3 of 20

--- Page 4 ---
human beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) RNA, which serves as an internal process control. If present,
the amplified pathogen target (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and/or influenza B) and the amplified
internal process control hybridize to specific probes located on a flow cell. For SARS-CoV-2,
primer sets are included targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene and the open reading frame 1ab
(ORF-1ab) gene. The primer sets for influenza A target the matrix protein 1 (M1) gene. For
influenza B, the primer set targets the nuclear export protein (NEP) and nonstructural protein 1
(NS1) genes. Detection of the target-specific PCR product is accomplished via an enzyme-linked
colorimetric assay using streptavidin bound horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a colorimetric
substrate that forms a purple precipitate. Test results can be expected in approximately 30
minutes and are visually interpreted by the operator.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision/reproducibility study was conducted with the Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test
at three CLIA-waived external sites by a total of six untrained operators (two operators at each
site). Each operator tested a panel (Table 1) in triplicate each day across six non-consecutive
days. The panel consisted of seven members (live virus for influenza A and influenza B, and
inactivated virus for SARS-CoV-2) prepared by spiking organisms in negative pooled clinical
swab matrix and applied to individual dry nasopharyngeal swabs. Three reagent lots were used in
this study. Results were generated from a total of 108 replicates of each panel member (3 sites x
6 days x 2 operators/site x 3 replicates/operator/day).

a. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
SARS-CoV-2 In Silico Analysis:
The inclusivity of the Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test was evaluated using in silico
analysis of the forward primers, reverse primers, and probes for the SARS-CoV-2 target
systems in relation to sequences available in the GISAID gene database. SARS-CoV-2 in
silico analysis was performed using all available SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the GISAID
database up to August 2, 2024 (>16.8 million sequences). The SARS-CoV-2 sequences
included the following lineages and variants of concern (VOC) or variants of interest (VOI)
that may have important epidemiological, immunological, or pathogenic properties from a
public health perspective: Delta, Alpha, Omicron BA.1, Omicron BA.2, Omicron BA.4,
Omicron BA.5, Omicron BQ.1, Omicron BQ.1.1, Omicron BF.7, Gamma, Epsilon, Iota,
Beta, Mu, Zeta, Kappa, Eta, Lamba, and Theta, and others.

All mismatches present in >5% of SARS-CoV-2 sequences (either overall or in the last 30,
60, 90, or 120 days prior to analysis) underwent further in silico analysis. None of these
mismatches analyzed are predicted to significantly reduce the percent of primer/probe bound
at the nominal annealing/detection temperatures of the device; the maximum predicted
reduction in binding across all analyzed mismatches is < 18% in only the N1 primer/probe
set. These minor reductions in primer/probe binding, in combination with the redundancy of
the N1 or Orf1ab gene assay targets is expected to have a minimal impact on the ability of
the Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test to detect variants for SARS-CoV-2.
Wet Testing:
An analytical reactivity study was conducted to evaluate the ability of the Visby Medical
Respiratory Health Test to detect multiple SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B strains
that are temporally and geographically diverse. This study evaluated ten H1N1 (pandemic
2009) strains, 13 H3N2 strains, 12 influenza B strains (five each of Victoria and Yamagata
lineages and two additional strains), and six SARS-CoV-2 strains as shown in Table 5
below. Inactivated strains were used for SARS-CoV-2 and cultured virus were used for
influenza strains, unless noted. Each virus was spiked into negative pooled clinical swab
matrix at analyte concentrations of 3x LoD. This spiked material was then transferred onto a
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and tested on three devices.
Of the 41 viruses tested, 40 were successfully detected in 3/3 devices for the expected strain
(influenza A, influenza B or SARS-CoV-2) on the Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test at
≤ 3x LoD. The Omicron (BA.2.3) isolate (USA/MD-HP24556/2022) was detected in 3/3
devices at 6x LoD. The results from this study demonstrate that the Visby Medical
Respiratory Health Test is capable of detecting multiple strains of influenza A, influenza B
and SARS-CoV2 that are circulating in humans at the concentrations tested.

c. Microbial Interference:
A microbial interference study was conducted to assess potential inhibitory effects of 43 non-
target microorganisms (including pooled human nasal wash) that may be found in a human
respiratory specimen (Table 6) on performance of the Visby Medical Respiratory Health
Test. Panels were composed of up to five different non-target microorganisms spiked into
pooled clinical swab matrix that contained low positive (i.e., 3x LoD) concentrations of each
target organism SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020, inactivated virus), influenza A (2009
H1N1, Brisbane/02/18, live virus), and influenza B (Victoria, Washington/02/19, live virus).
Non-target organisms were spiked at ≥1x105 TCID /mL (for viruses) and ≥1x106 CFU/mL

was tested in triplicate.
All sample groups returned 3/3 devices with the expected negative results. Overall, the data
shows that none of the 43 organisms (including pooled human nasal wash) cause false
negative results when tested using the Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test at the
concentrations tested.

d. Competitive Interference:
The potential for high concentrations (i.e., >1x105 copies/swab) of one target organism to
interfere with detection of low concentrations (i.e., 3x LoD) of another target organism (i.e.,
co-infections with on-target analytes) was evaluated for the Visby Medical Respiratory
Health Test.
Influenza A (2009 H1N1, Brisbane/02/18, live virus), influenza B (Victoria,
Washington/02/19, live virus), and SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020, inactivated virus)
viruses were spiked into negative pooled clinical swab matrix at varying concentrations and
then tested in triplicate. Low concentrations were prepared at 3x LoD for the respective
viruses, and high concentrations were prepared as described in Table 7. No competitive
interference was observed for any of the three target viruses at the concentrations tested.

e. Interfering Substances:
The performance of the Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test was evaluated in the
presence of medically and/or physiologically relevant concentrations of potentially
interfering substances that may be present in a respiratory specimen. For this study, negative
swab clinical sample matrix pools were individually spiked with the potential interfering
substances at the concentrations denoted in Table 8. To determine if these potential
interfering substances impact test performance in the presence and absence of target analytes,
both target-spiked and target-non-spiked samples were generated, respectively. Target-spiked
samples were created by triple spiking influenza A (2009 H1N1, Brisbane/02/18, live virus),
influenza B (Victoria, Washington/02/19, live virus), and SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020,
inactivated virus) at 3x LoD into negative pooled swab clinical sample matrix, containing a
single potential interfering substance. Target-non-spiked samples consisted of negative
pooled nasal swab clinical sample matrix and a single potential interfering substance. For
each potentially interfering substance, three replicates were tested for the target-spiked and
target-non-spiked samples.
All target-non-spiked samples were 100% negative for influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-
CoV-2. All target-spiked samples were 100% positive for influenza A, influenza B, and
SARS-CoV-2, except for cotton and rayon swabs. For these swab materials, two of the three
target-spiked samples were positive for all targets, while one of three target-spiked samples
was negative for SARS-CoV-2. Based on the results for cotton and rayon swabs, these swab

6. Detection Limit:
a. Limit of Detection (Individual Analytes):
The purpose of this study was to determine the limit of detection (LoD) of the Visby Medical
Respiratory Health Test for the detection of influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 as
single analytes. The study assessed two live strains of influenza A (influenza A 2009 H1N1,
Brisbane/02/18 and influenza A H3N2, Kansas/14/2017) and influenza B (influenza B
Victoria, Washington/02/19 and influenza B Yamagata, Oklahoma/10/2018), and one
inactivated strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020). Each organism was individually
spiked into pooled negative clinical swab matrix and applied at the appropriate final
concentration to nasopharyngeal swabs for testing per the instructions for use for the Visby
Medical Respiratory Health Test. Each virus was tested in a range finding study that included
five concentrations of a three-fold dilution series, where each concentration was tested with
five replicates. The lowest concentration with 100% detection was estimated to be the LoD.
The estimated LoD for each strain was verified by testing 20 replicates at the estimated LoD
concentration and demonstrating that at least 19/20 replicates were positive. If the criteria of
at least 19 out of 20 positive replicates were not met, testing was repeated with a higher
concentration until at least 19/20 replicates gave a positive result.
The LoD of the Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test for influenza A, influenza B, and
SARS-CoV-2 are summarized in Table 9.

1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
See Clinical Studies below.
2. Matrix Comparison:
An LoD equivalency study was conducted to compare side-by-side testing of the same viral
stocks prepared in nasal and nasopharyngeal swab matrices and eluted in Visby Respiratory
Buffer. Testing was performed with a minimum of three dilutions and until the concentration
was found for each virus in each matrix with at least 19/20 positive results where the dilution
below had < 19/20 positive results. The LoD was considered equivalent between the nasal
and nasopharyngeal swab matrices if the lowest concentration of virus with at least 19/20
positives is within one three-fold dilution for each other.
Influenza A, influenza B, and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus were spiked into each matrix at
the specified concentration for each target to prepare a triple positive sample. Three triple
positive samples were made in each matrix, and they were tested with 20 devices.
The results of the testing are summarized in Table 10 below. The bolded results indicate the
lowest concentrations for each virus with at least 19/20 positive results. These results support
that the LoD for detection of influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 are equivalent for
nasal and nasopharyngeal swab matrices.

February 2024. The average age among study participants was 34 years, with a range between
one month to 89 years of age.
One NP swab specimens or dual nostril AN swab specimen was collected from each eligible
subject. The AN specimens could be self-collected under health care provider (HCP) observation
(for subjects ≥ 14 years of age), or health care provider (HCP) collected, and all NP swabs were
HCP collected. The swab specimen was placed directly in the Visby Respiratory Health Buffer
and tested on-site by study operators using the Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test. The
participating operators conducted the test by following the instructions in the Quick Reference
Guide (QRG). The study operators were representative of operators conducting testing at a CLIA
Waived setting and did not receive any training on the use of the Visby Medical Respiratory
Health Test.
The specimen was also tested at the reference laboratory for comparator testing using an FDA-
cleared nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for influenza A and influenza B targets and a
highly sensitive FDA-authorized laboratory-based RT-PCR EUA assay for the SARS-CoV-2
target.
A total of 1,592 subjects were initially enrolled. Study samples were excluded from the data
analysis due to lack of a valid comparator result (n=53), lack of a valid Visby Medical
Respiratory Health Test result (n=21), the subject was asymptomatic (n=10), or for protocol
deviations (i.e., failure to complete a required procedure (n=4) or incorrectly filled out informed
consent form (n=2)). Additionally, one subject withdrew from the study. This left 1,501 subjects
for performance analysis.
The performance estimates for the Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B were calculated as positive percent agreement
(PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the comparator result, which are shown in
Tables 11-13 stratified by specimen type. These results are stratified by site in Tables 14-16.

Of the 1,575 tests performed on the Visby Medical Respiratory Health Test, 79 (5.0%, 95% CI =
4.0-6.2%) had an initial invalid test result of which 21 (1.3%, 95% CI = 0.8-2.0%) were invalid
when retested. Invalid results were more frequent for ANS (6.7% initial with 95% CI = 5.0-
8.7%, 2.2% upon repeat with 95% CI = 1.3-3.5%) than for NPS (3.6% initial with 95% CI = 2.5-
5.1%, 0.6% upon retest with 95% CI = 0.3-1.4%).
