B Indication(s) for Use:
The Atellica® CH Creatinine_3 (Crea3) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative
determination of creatinine in human serum, plasma (lithium heparin, dipotassium EDTA, and
sodium heparin), and urine using the Atellica® CH Analyzer. Such measurements are used in the
diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases, and in monitoring renal dialysis.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Atellica® CH Analyzer
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Atellica® CH Creatinine_3 (Crea3) assay kit has 2 major reagent packs. Reagent pack 1
(P1) contains 21.8 mL of sodium hydroxide (1.0 mol/L), and reagent pack 2 (P) contains 13.26
mL of lithium picrate (25 mmol/L).
The Atellica® CH Creatinine_3 (Crea3) assay is for in vitro diagnostic use with the Atellica®
CH Analyzer (previously cleared under K151767).
B Principle of Operation:
The Atellica® CH Crea3 assay is based on the reaction of picrate with creatinine in an alkaline
medium. The technique is based on modified kinetic Jaffe technique with rate blanking and
intercept correction. In the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydroxide, picrate reacts
with creatinine to form a red chromophore creatinine picrate complex. The rate of complex
formation is measured at 505/571 nm and is proportional to the creatinine concentration in the
sample. Rate blanking is used to reduce interference from non-specific serum/plasma protein
interactions with the reagent.

2. Linearity:
A linearity study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP06-Ed2. Samples were prepared
by mixing high and low concentration samples to span the measurement interval; at least 9
samples were used to evaluate the entire measuring interval for serum and urine. Five
replicates were tested for each sample and the mean of these replicates was used for the
calculation. The concentrations for serum samples ranged from 0.12 - 38 mg/dL and the
concentrations for urine samples ranged from 1.33 - 264 mg/dL. The results showed that the
deviation from linearity did not exceed 5% for samples within the measuring range.
The regression statistics of the serum linearity study:
Y=1.040x+0.053, r: 0.999
The regression statistics of the urine linearity study:
Y=1.002x+0.160, r = 1.000
The results of the linearity studies support the claimed analytical measuring range from 0.15
mg/dL to 30.00 mg/dL for serum/plasma, and 3.00 mg/dL to 245.00 mg/dL for urine for the
candidate device.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
The evaluation of potential interferents followed the recommendations in CLSI EP07-Ed3.

Serum
Human serum pools were split into control and test pools. The test pools were spiked with
the interferents, and the control pools were spiked with an equivalent volume of compound
the interferent was prepared in. For serum samples, low-level analyte pool was native serum
(creatinine concentration of 0.60 mg/dL), and the high-level analyte pool was native serum
spiked with creatinine (creatinine concentration of 2.0 mg/dL). Five replicates were tested
per sample. Substances identified with > 10% (at an analyte concentration of 2.00 mg/dL) or
± 0.15 mg/dL (at an analyte concentration of 0.60 mg/dL) bias were considered to have
interfered. For any substances identified as an interferent, dose response testing and analysis
was conducted to assess the highest concentration limit below which no significant
interference was observed.

Urine
Human urine pools were split into control and test pools. The test pools were spiked with the
interferents, and the control pools were spiked with an equivalent volume of the compound
the interferent was prepared in. For urine samples, the low creatinine concentration (40.00
mg/dL) samples and the high creatinine concentration (180.00 mg/dL) samples were unique
native human urine samples. Five replicates were tested per sample. Substances identified
with > 10% bias were considered to have interfered. For any substances identified as an
interferent, dose response testing and analysis was conducted to assess the highest

Limitations:
The sponsor included the following limitation statements in their instructions for use:
• Use of assay is not recommended for patients taking Cefoxitin. Cefoxitin may produce
falsely increased results.
• The Atellica CH Crea3 assay is susceptible to interference from cephalosporin class
antibiotics at therapeutically relevant interferent concentrations.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
The Atellica® CH Creatinine_3 (Crea3) assay reportable range on the Atellica® CH
Analyzer is 0.15 mg/dL to 30.00 mg/dL for serum/plasma, and 3.00 mg/dL to 245.00 mg/dL
for urine.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability:
The Atellica® CH Chemistry Calibrator (CHEM CAL) is traceable to NIST SRM 967.
On-board Reagent Stability:
An open bottle stability study was conducted to ensure the reagent performed consistently
throughout the claimed in use/onboard stability. The study results support the claim of on-
board stability of 17 days. All protocols and results were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
Sample Stability
A sample stability study was conducted to establish the recommendations for the handling of
patient samples specified in the Atellica® CH Creatinine_3 (Crea3) assay Instructions for
Use. Study protocols and results for serum and urine sample stability were reviewed and
found to be acceptable.
Calibration Interval:
The calibration interval study completed confirmed the lot calibration interval (defines the
time the Atellica® CH Analyzer can store a fresh pack calibration) of 180 days and pack
calibration interval (defines the time before re-calibration is required within an opened
reagent pack chamber (well-set)) of 10 days. The protocol and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable.
6. Detection Limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of
the Atellica® CH Creatinine_3 (Crea_3) on the Atellica® CH Analyzer were evaluated in
accordance with CLSI EP17-A2. The LoQ was defined as the lowest concentration of
creatinine at which the total analytical error is ≤ 0.10 mg/dL for serum and plasma and ≤ 1.50
mg/dL for urine. A brief protocol and the results are summarized in the tables below:

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The accuracy of the Atellica® CH Creatinine_3 (Crea3) assay on the Atellica® CH analyzer
for serum and urine was evaluated for agreement with the predicate device by a method
comparison study. The method comparison study was performed following the
recommendations in CLSI EP09c-Ed3. A total of 151 serum samples (13 of the 151 samples
were spiked) and 113 native urine samples were tested on the predicate device and on the
candidate device. These samples were tested on one Atellica® CH Analyzer in silicate for
both assays. Weighted Deming statistics were used to calculate the regression equations
below:

The specimen equivalency was determined using the Weighted Deming regression. A total of
50 four-way matched sample sets (serum, lithium heparin plasma, sodium heparin plasma
and EDTA plasma) were processed and tested with N= 1 replicate. The following results
were obtained:
