C Type of Test:
Qualitative and semi-quantitative urinalysis
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The Safecare Urinary Tract Infection Test is for the qualitative detection of Leukocytes (LEU,
white blood cells) and nitrite (NIT) in urine as an aid in the screening of a Urinary Tract
infection (UTI). It is intended for over-the-counter home use.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
OTC - Over The Counter
D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Safecare Urinary Tract Infection Test is an in vitro diagnostic test device for qualitative
detection of leukocytes and nitrite in urine. The device is composed of two-color pads aligned on
a strip. One pad is employed for testing leukocyte and the other for nitrite by visually reading the
color change of the pad and comparing to the corresponding blocks on a color chart.
B Principle of Operation:
The Safecare Urinary Tract Infection Test measures the color developed in two reaction zones
(leukocytes and nitrite pads) on the test strips following application of a urine sample. The
developed colors are then compared to calibration colors on the color chart.
This leukocyte test is based on the action of leukocyte esterase, which cleaves a derivatized
pyrrolidine amino acid ester substrate to liberate derivatized hydroxy pyrazole. This compound
then reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a colored compound (pink to purple).
This nitrite test uses the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of bacteria in the urine.
Urinary nitrite reacts with p-arsanilic acid to form a diazonium compound in an acidic medium.
The compound then couples with 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[h]quinolin-3-ol to produce a pink
color.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed with the Safecare Urinary Tract Infection Test at three (3)
test sites with two (2) operators at each site. Samples were fresh urine samples collected and
pooled on the same day that the study was conducted, then spiked with leukocyte esterase
and nitrite stock solutions to obtain the concentration levels (1-8) listed in the table below.
The evaluation included three (3) replicate assays over five (5) days. A total of forty-five (45)
assay results on each of eight levels of test sample were obtained. Three lots of the device
were used with each level of control. All sample concentrations were masked. Results are
listed in the following table:

b. Linearity:

c. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Potentially interfering substances were added into negative urine or urine with different
leukocyte esterase and nitrite concentrations. These samples were tested with three lots of the
Safecare Urinary Tract Infection Test by three different operators (one operator per lot). The
following substances showed no interference with the test at the specified concentrations:
Substances Concentration (mg/dL)
Albumin 1000
Ammonium Chloride 400
Ascorbic Acid 100
Bilirubin 10
Ciprofloxacin 1
Creatinine 600
Fructose 18
Galactose 15
Glucose 500

* This interferent is tested for Leukocyte results only.
High levels of glucose (≥1000 mg/dL) or high ascorbic acid (≥150 mg/dL) may decrease
leukocyte readings. High ascorbic acid (≥150 mg/dL) may cause a false negative nitrite
reading.

To investigate the effect of urine specific gravity and urine pH, urine samples with specific
gravity ranging from 1.000 to 1.035 and urine samples with pH ranging from pH of 5 to 9
were tested at different leukocyte esterase and nitrite concentrations. The test results show
that pH > 8.0 may cause false positive leukocyte readings, and specific gravity ≥1.035 may
cause false negative leukocyte readings. Neither pH nor specific gravity affects nitrite testing.
Sample Carryover
A sample carryover study was performed. Three (3) lots of test strips were used for testing.
The study was performed by either dipping the test strip into the sample or simulating
urination with the sample and then holding the test strip vertically upwards or downwards for
10 seconds to allow the sample to flow from one pad to the other pad (i.e., run-over of high-
concentration leukocyte esterase samples from the leukocyte pad to the nitrite pad and run-
over of high-concentration nitrite samples from the nitrite pad to the leukocyte pad). Testing
was also repeated in the other direction. The study demonstrated that carryover (run-over)
does not impact the test results.
d. Assay Reportable Range:
The results of the analytical studies support the following measurement ranges:
Analyte Measurement range
Leukocyte qualitative: Negative, Trace, +, ++, +++
Esterase semi-quantitative: Negative, 0.0018, 0.0084, 0.015, 0.06
(mg/mL)
Nitrite qualitative: Negative, Positive
e. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
The nitrite test is traceable to NIST SRM 8040, and the leukocyte pad is traceable to a
commercially available solution.
Stability
The sponsor provided information to support that the device is stable for 15 months when
stored at 4-30°C based on real-time stability studies.
The sponsor instructs the user to use the test strip immediately after the foil pouch is opened,
but no longer than 1 hour after opening, based on the results of an open-pouch stability study.
f. Detection Limit:
See Assay Cut-off section below.
g. Assay Cut-Off:
A cut-off study was performed to evaluate the lower limits of detection for each analyte on
the Safecare Urinary Tract Infection Test. Urine samples were spiked to known

concentrations of each analyte. Each sample was tested in three (3) device lots by three (3)
different operators in a total of 30 replicates per sample. The sponsor defined the lowest
concentration with ≥ 95% test of results positive as the limit of detection. The results support
the claim that the sensitivity of the leukocyte test is 0.0018 mg/mL leukocyte esterase, and
the sensitivity of the nitrite test is 0.05 mg/dL.

The sponsor provided studies to support the recommended wetting time (1-2 seconds), the
recommended reading time (2 minutes), and provided a lighting study supporting that the
Safecare Urinary Tract Infection test can be correctly read under fluorescent, incandescent, and
natural lighting conditions.
2. Comparison Studies:
a. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Three (3) sites were selected to perform the lay-user method comparison studies. One
hundred and fifty-four (154) lay users with UTI symptoms were recruited to test their own
urine sample using the Safecare Urinary Tract Infection Test. Laypersons performed one test
with the Safecare Urinary Tract Infection Test according to the product insert and then
collected a sample of their urine for comparison testing by professionals using the predicate
device. The results obtained by the lay users using the Safecare Urinary Tract Infection Test
compared to the results obtained by the professionals using the predicate device when used
following its product insert are summarized below.
