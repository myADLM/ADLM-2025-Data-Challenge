B Indication(s) for Use:
The CLUNGENE Fentanyl Home Test Cassette is competitive binding, lateral flow
immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of Fentanyl in human urine at the cut
off concentration of 1.0 ng/mL. This test provides only a preliminary result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
(LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Evaluate preliminary positive results carefully.
The CLUNGENE Fentanyl Test Cassette is competitive binding, lateral flow
immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of Fentanyl in human urine at the cut
off concentration of 1.0 ng/mL. This test provides only a preliminary result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed presumptive positive result. Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
(LC-MS), and their tandem mass-spectrometer versions are the preferred confirmatory methods.
Careful consideration and judgment should be applied to any drugs of abuse screen test result,
particularly when evaluating preliminary positive results.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The CLUNGENE Fentanyl Tests are immunoassays intended for the qualitative detection of
fentanyl in human urine. Each CLUNGENE Fentanyl Test device consists of a Test Cassette, a
Dropper and a package insert. Each Test Cassette is sealed with sachets of desiccant in an
aluminum pouch.
B Principle of Operation:
The CLUNGENE Fentanyl Test Cassette detects Fentanyl through visual interpretation of color
development on the device. Drug conjugates are immobilized on the test region of the
membrane. During testing, the specimen reacts with antibodies conjugated to colored particles
and precoated on the sample pad. The mixture then migrates through the membrane by capillary
action, and interacts with reagents on the membrane. If there are insufficient drug molecules in
the specimen, the antibody- colored particle conjugate will bind to the drug conjugates, forming
a colored band at the test region of the membrane. Therefore, a colored band appears in the test
region when the urine is negative for the drug. If drug molecules are present in the urine above
the cut-off concentration of the test, they compete with the immobilized drug conjugate on the
test region for limited antibody binding sites. This will prevent attachment of the antibody-
colored particle conjugate to the test region. Therefore, the absence of a colored band at the test
region indicates a positive result. The appearance of a colored band at the control region serves
K242802 - Page 2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
as a procedural control, indicating that the proper volume of specimen has been added and
membrane wicking has occurred.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was carried out at one site for samples with concentrations of -100% cut off, -
75% cut off, -50% cut off, -25% cut off, cut off, +25% cut off, +50% cut off, +75% cut off and
+100% cut off, where the fentanyl cut-off concentration was 1 ng/mL. Samples with
concentration of -100% cut-off were drug-free urine samples. Other samples were prepared by
spiking fentanyl in negative samples, and the study was randomized and blinded. Each fentanyl
concentration was confirmed by LC/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person
who prepared the samples and didn’t take part in the sample testing. Samples were tested by
three operators using three different lots at two runs per day per operator for 10 days in a
randomized order. Eighteen tests per day per concentration (3 operators x 3 lots x 2 runs) were
tested for a total of 162 tests per day. There is a total of 60 tests per lot per concentration.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable, this device is intended for qualitative use only.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-Reactivity:
To test specificity, similarly structured drug metabolites and other components that are likely to
interfere in urine samples were added to the drug-free urine samples at different concentrations
and tested using three lots of the device by three different operators. Results are expressed as a
minimum concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce positive response
(ng/mL). The percent cross reactivity of those compounds (calculated by dividing the cutoff
concentration by the minimum concentration required to obtain a positive result and then
multiplying by 100%) and lowest concentration that caused a positive result for each compound
are listed below.

A randomized and blinded method comparison study was conducted at one testing site by three
operators between the CLUNGENE Fentanyl Test Cassette and LC-MS/MS method using only
one device lot. Clinical samples tested included a total of 80 urine samples (40 negative and 40
positive) obtained from a hospital laboratory. The samples were blinded and compared to LC/MS
results. Sample concentrations of fentanyl were confirmed by LC-MS/MS and ranged from drug-
free, < -50% Cut-off (low positive), between -50% Cutoff and the cutoff (near cut-off negative),
between cutoff and +50% (near cut-off positive), and > +50% Cut-off (high positive), with
fentanyl cut-off of 1 ng/mL. The results are summarized in the tables below.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Lay User Study:
A lay user study was performed at three sites representative of intended use settings with 140 lay
persons and three device lots. The lay users had diverse educational and professional
backgrounds and ranged in age from 19 to >50 years. Urine samples were prepared at -100%, +/-
75%, +/-50%, and +/-25% of the fentanyl cut-off by spiking fentanyl into 6 drug free-pooled
urine sample pools. Drug-free urine samples were also used in the study. The drug
concentrations of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was further aliquoted
into 20 individual containers (total 140 aliquots), blind-labeled and randomized. All 140 aliquots
were distributed to the three testing sites, where each participant was provided with the package
insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. Each participant tested the sample with the device,
and the results are summarized below.
