The Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution (PIPS) 5.1 is an automated digital slide creation,
viewing, and management system. The PIPS 5.1 is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid
to the pathologist to review and interpret digital images of surgical pathology slides prepared
from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. The PIPS 5.1 is not intended for use with
frozen section, cytology, or non-FFPE hematopathology specimens.
The PIPS 5.1 comprises the Image Management System (IMS) 4.2, Ultra-Fast Scanner (UFS),
Pathology Scanner SG20, Pathology Scanner SG60, Pathology Scanner SG300 and Philips
PP27QHD display or a Beacon C411W display. The PIPS 5.1 is for creation and viewing of
digital images of scanned glass slides that would otherwise be appropriate for manual
visualization by conventional light microscopy. It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist
to employ appropriate procedures and safeguards to assure the validity of the interpretation of
images obtained using PIPS 5.1.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The PIPS 5.1 device is an automated digital slide creation, viewing and management system.
PIPS 5.1 consists of two subsystems and a display component:
1. Subsystems
a. Whole slide imaging scanners:
i. Ultra Fast Scanner (UFS)
ii. Pathology Scanner Second Generation (SG) with different versions for varying
slide capacity: Pathology Scanner SG20, Pathology Scanner SG60, Pathology
Scanner SG300
b. Image Management System (IMS) 4.2
2. PP27QHD or Beacon C411W Display
