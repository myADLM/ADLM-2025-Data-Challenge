Qualitative multiplexed nucleic acid-based test
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is a qualitative multiplexed nucleic acid-
based in vitro diagnostic test intended for use with the BioCode MDx 3000 Instrument. The
BioCode GPP is capable of the simultaneous detection and identification of nucleic acids from
multiple bacteria, viruses, and parasites extracted directly from unpreserved stool samples or
stool preserved in Cary-Blair transport medium obtained from individuals with signs and/or
symptoms of gastrointestinal infection. The following bacteria, parasites, and viruses are
identified using the BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel:
▪Campylobacter (C. jejuni/C. coli)
▪Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin A/B (Fresh samples only)
▪Salmonella spp
▪Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus/V. vulnificus/ V. cholerae), including specific identification of
Vibrio parahaemolyticus
▪Yersinia enterocolitica
▪Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC)
▪Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) lt/st
▪E. coli O157 serogroup
▪Shiga-like toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) stx1/stx2
▪Shigella/ Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC)
▪Cryptosporidium spp (C. parvum/C. hominis)

▪Norovirus GI/GII
▪Rotavirus A
The BioCode GPP is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of gastrointestinal
illness and results are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical, laboratory, and
epidemiological data. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only. For Prescription Use Only.
Positive results do not rule out co-infection with organisms not included in the BioCode GPP.
The agent detected may not be the definite cause of the disease. Negative results in ths setting of
clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not
detected by this test or non-infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome,
or Crohn’s disease. Concomitant culture is necessary for organism recovery and further typing of
bacterial agents. This device is not intended to monitor or guide treatment for C. difficile
infection.
Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during the
prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for Adenovirus 40/41, Campylobacter, E.
coli O157, Shigella/EIEC, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Giardia lamblia were established
additionally with retrospective clinical specimens. Performance characteristics for Entamoeba
histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Yersinia enterocolitica and Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus, V.
vulnificus, and V. cholerae) were established primarily using contrived clinical specimens.

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The BioCode Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is a multiplexed nucleic acid-based test
designed to be used with the BioCode MDx 3000 system. The BioCode MDx 3000 is an
automated system that integrates PCR amplification, target capture, signal generation and optical
detection for multiple gastrointestinal pathogens from a single stool specimen, either unpreserved
or in Cary Blair. Stool specimens are processed, and nucleic acids extracted with BioMérieux
NucliSENS easyMAG, Roche MagNA Pure 96, or Thermo Fisher KingFisher Flex. Once the
PCR plate is set up and sealed, all other operations are automated on MDx 3000. The BioCode
MDx 3000 Gastrointestinal Infection Panel simultaneously tests for 17 pathogens from
unpreserved stool specimens or stool collected in Cary-Blair transport medium. Results from the
BioCode GPP test are available within less than 4 hours.
B Principle of Operation:
K242877 - Page 3 of 21

--- Page 4 ---
The principle of operation of the BioCode MDx 3000 remains unchanged from the initial
clearance in K180041. Refer to the published decision summary for additional information. The
BioCode MDx-3000 is an automated system that integrates PCR amplification, target
capture, signal generation and optical detection for multiple gastrointestinal pathogens from a
single stool specimen, either unpreserved or in Cary-Blair. Stool specimens are processed and
nucleic acids are extracted with either the BioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG, Roche MagNA
Pure 96, or Thermo Fisher KingFisher Flex automated systems. Once the PCR plate is set up and
sealed, all other operations are automated on the MDx 3000.
The BioCode MDx 3000 Software controls the operation of the instrument, collects and analyzes
data, and automatically generates interpretation for test reports at the end of the run.
Fluorescent signals from BMBs with the same barcode are sorted and calculated to generate
median fluorescence index (MFI) for each analyte. The presence or absence of a pathogen is
determined relative to the validated assay cutoff by MFI. The software also analyzes the results
of external and internal controls to validate the run and individual specimen results for
reporting.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted to evaluate variability associated with extraction of
samples with the KingFisher Flex system This study was designed to assess intra-assay
(within run), Inter-assay (run-to-run), day-to-day and instrument-to-instrument (operator-to-
operator) reproducibility. One lot of reagents was assayed at Applied BioCode on two
instruments by three operators. Testing was performed including two runs per day per
operator for five days (a total of 30 runs).
Organisms were diluted directly into Cary-Blair, and pools were constructed in Cary Blair
media at 15X or 30X LoD. The prepared pools were then diluted 1:10 fold in pre-screened
negative stool, frozen over night or longer, extracted in triplicate and assayed in singlicate.
The reproducibility panel consisted of 7 contrived samples (sample 7 is a negative control)
extracted in triplicate and each assayed in singlet. The samples consisted of combinations of
12 representative targets at 1.5x LoD (Low) and 3x LoD (Medium). Results from the study
are shown in Table 1 below.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable because the BioCode GPP is a qualitative assay.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Analytical specificity of the BioCode GPP was evaluated in the original510(k) Premarket
Notification (K180041). No additional testing was conducted.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Not applicable because the BioCode GPP is a qualitative assay.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
No modifications were made to the BioCode GPP assay or MDx 3000 instrument system.
Please refer to the published decision summary for the original 510(k) submission for
additional information (K180041).
6. Detection Limit:
The LoD of BioCode GPP assay was evaluated when the KingFisher Flex instrument was used
for nucleic acid extraction. Contrived samples were prepared with the 21 quantified bacteria,
virus, or parasite stocks (Table 3) as well as 1 high Norovirus GI-positive and 1 high Norovirus
GII-positive clinical specimens. Each stock was serially diluted and extracted to challenge
analytical sensitivity of the assay. LoD for each stock was the lowest concentration with ≥95%
detection of 20 replicates (19 out of 20). LoD were verified for both unpreserved stool and Cary-
Blair preserved stool. To minimize the required volume of reagents and negative matrix and operator
time, the LoD study was performed using dual analyte spiked samples. Side by side dilutions (initial
10-fold dilution series followed by finer dilutions) of the Norovirus GI and Norovirus GII clinical
specimens was performed and assayed to demonstrate the equivalence between the cleared extraction
platform EasyMag and KingFisher Flex.

Organism stocks were serially diluted in Cary-Blair to 10x final screening concentration and
combined with prescreened negative stool or Cary-Blair stool at a 1:10 ratio at the time of
extraction. Four (4) replicates of each concentration in unpreserved stool and Cary-Blair stool
were extracted on the easyMAG and KingFisher Flex and tested singly with BioCode GPP assay
on the BioCode MDx-3000 system to estimate LoD. The LoD was verified by extracting 20
replicates of each sample type with the easyMAG and KingFisher Flex and testing each extracted
sample singly for a total of 20 replicates at or near presumptive LoD. Verification testing (20
replicates) was performed with unpreserved stool samples and Cary-Blair samples. Verification
testing (20 replicates) was performed with single targets or in combination with other
organism(s).
For Norovirus GI and GII targets, high positive clinical specimens were used and side by side
dilutions (initial 10-fold dilution series followed by finer dilutions) was performed and assayed.
Each dilution was extracted in quadruplicate with the easyMAG and KingFisher Flex and
assayed singly. Twenty (20) replicates at the dilution in which all 3 replicates are detected was
assayed to confirm the LoD for each of the two systems.
For Norovirus, as shown in Table 6, the LoD of the Norovirus GII in unpreserved stool was
equivalent for 3 extraction systems. For Norovirus GI, the KingFisher Flex is 10-fold and 3-fold
more sensitive than the easyMAG. For Cary-Blair stool, as shown in Table 7, the LoD of the
Norovirus GI was equivalent for the two systems.

and 214 inoculated Cary-Blair stool) were evaluated with both the KingFisher Flex procedure
and previously cleared methods employing the easyMAG extraction platform. These remnant
samples were used to support the original 510(k) clearance of the BioCode GPP device.
Fifty-four (54) frozen unpreserved samples were used for the C. difficile testing. In addition, a
total of 120 samples were contrived at 3x LoD and 6x LoD (15 samples at 3x LoD and 15
samples at 6xLoD for each of three targets) and tested to determine the performance
characteristics for Entamoeba histolytica, Yersinia enlerocolitica and Vibrio spp. (V.
parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and V. cholerae). The demographics of the enrolled subjects in
the clinical study are shown in Table 8 below.
For each specimen, the results and the validity were determined per the Interpretation Algorithm
of the BioCode GPP. The PPA was calculated as TP/(TP + FN). TP = true positive or positive by
both the EasyMag and the Kingfisher Flex; FN = false negative or negative by the Kingfisher
Flex only. The NPA was calculated as TN/(TN + FP). TN= true negative or negative by the
EasyMag and the KingFisher Flex; FP = false positive or positive by the KingFisher Flex only.
The PPA and NPA of the results between the KingFisher Flex and the easyMAG for individual
targets for each sample type (unpreserved stool or Cary-Blair stool) and for the combined sample
types plus binomial two-sided 95% confidence interval were calculated. The overall PPA and
NPA of the results between the KingFisher Flex and the easyMAG for all targets combined for
each sample type (unpreserved stool or Cary-Blair stool) and for the combined sample types plus
binomial two-sided 95% confidence interval were calculated. The agreement for samples with
co-infections were calculated separately. After discordant analysis, samples that were still invalid
were excluded in the agreement calculations. The percentage of invalid samples was calculated
for information only.

Thirty-five archived samples with discordant results (between the easyMAG and KingFisher Flex were retested
twice with both easyMAG and KingFisher Flex.
aCampylobacter spp. One false positive continued to be positive whereas two false positives became negative by
KingFisher Flex upon retesting. Twelve samples were still invalid upon retesting and not used in the agreement
calculation.

negative by EasyMag upon retesting whereas one remained positive. Ten samples were invalid, not used in the
agreement calculation.
cE. coli O157: Thirteen samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.
dEAEC: Of the two false negatives, one was negative by EasyMag and one remained positive upon retesting. Twelve
samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.
eETEC: Thirteen samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.
fSTEC: Two false negatives were Negative by EasyMag upon retesting. One false positive was negative by
KingFisher and positive by EasyMag upon retesting. Twelve samples were still invalid, not used in the agreement
calculation.
gSalmonella spp. Of the two false positives, one was negative by KingFisher Flex and one remained positive upon
retesting. Thirteen samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.
hShigella/EIEC. The false positive became positive by EasyMag upon retesting. Twelve samples were invalid, not

jVibrio spp. One false positive was negative by KingFisher Flex upon retesting. For the false negative retested, the
easyMAG had an invalid result with the 2nd run and a negative result with the 3rd run, whereas the KingFisher Flex
had negative results with both runs. Thirteen samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.
kYersinia enterocolitica: Of the false positives, one was negative by EasyMag upon retesting, and one remained
false positive upon retesting. Thirteen samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.
lCryptosporidium spp: Eleven samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.
mEntamoeba histolytica: Thirteen samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.
nGiardia lamblia: Thirteen samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.
oAdenovirus 40/41: The false negative was negative by EasyMag after retesting and the false positive was positive
by EasyMag upon retesting, respectively. Thirteen samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.
pNorovirus GI/GII: The false positive was negative on the KingFisher Flex upon retesting and the false negative was
positive by the KingFisher Flex upon retesting. Eleven samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.
qRotavirus: Of the ten false positives, six were negatives by the KingFisher Flex upon retesting and four remained
false positives upon retesting. Twelve samples were invalid, not used in the agreement calculation.
To supplement testing of archived samples, additional testing of contrived specimens were
evaluated for select analytes. Results of this additional testing are shown in Table 12 below.

Note. One hundred twenty contrived samples were tested. Five samples were invalid with the easyMAG on initial
testing. When the invalid samples were tested again with PCR, the samples remained invalid.
aOf the five invalids, one of the E. histolytica positives was had a positive assay result for E. histolytica but the RNA
internal control was invalid.
bOf the five invalids, one had a positive assay result for Yersinia enterocolitica, but the RNA internal control was
invalid.
cOne of the negative stools being used as matrix for contriving samples exhibited weak positivity for C. difficile and
erroneously enrolled as a negative sample. Because the C. difficile was not intended as part of the study, the positive
agreement calculation for this target was not included.
