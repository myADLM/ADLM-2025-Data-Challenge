B Principle of Operation:
The TeleRPM Gen2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is designed to quantitatively measure the
glucose concentration in fresh capillary whole blood. The glucose measurement is achieved by
using an amperometric detection method. The test is based on measurement of electrical current
caused by the reaction of the glucose with the reagents on the test strip. The blood sample is pulled
into the tip of the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with glucose
oxidase and the mediator in the test strip generating electrons and producing a current that is
proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. After the reaction time, the glucose
concentration is calculated by the meter from the detected current and the resulting glucose
concentration is displayed by the meter as plasma equivalent values.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
TeleRPM Gen2 Blood Glucose Meter
2. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The blood glucose monitoring system is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from
the finger only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary
action.
4. Calibration:
The meter does not require calibration or coding by the user. The meter is automatically
coded.
5. Quality Control:
Three levels of glucose control solutions are available for use with this system and can be
purchased separately. Recommendations on when to test with control solutions are provided
in the labeling. Acceptable ranges for each level of control solution are printed on the test strip
vial label. If the control result falls outside these ranges, the user is cautioned not to use the
meter and to contact customer support. The control solution readings are automatically marked
by the meter as control results and are not included in the patient result averages.

3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference studies were performed with the TeleRPM Gen2 Blood Glucose Monitoring
System. The study was conducted by using venous whole blood adjusted to three glucose
levels (50 to 70, 110 to 130, and 225 to 270 mg/dL). The adjusted blood glucose concentrations
were separated into a control sample with no interferent added and a test sample containing
one of 32 potentially interfering substances. The % bias was calculated from the difference
between the test sample and the control sample using the mean of replicates for each of the 3
strip lots tested. The highest tested concentrations at which no significant interference (the
mean bias for the test sample is within ±10% of the control mean) was observed are presented

using venous whole blood samples adjusted to 3 glucose levels (65.3, 110.5, and 347.5 mg/dL).
Testing was conducted under 6 combinations of temperature and relative humidity (RH)
including 114.8 °F (46 °C) and 39.2 °F (4 °C) and 8 % and 92 % RH, and under the nominal
condition of 73.4 °F (23 °C) at 40 % RH. The candidate system results were compared to those
obtained with the comparator method (YSI 2300 STAT PLUS Glucose and L-Lactate
Analyzer) under normal condition. The results support the claims in the labeling that the
TeleRPM Gen2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System can be used in conditions of 41 to 113 °F
with relative humidity of 10 to 90 %.
3. Altitude Effects Study:
The effect of altitude on the TeleRPM Gen2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated
by testing 15 whole blood samples concentrations ranging from 54.7 to 504 mg/dL at sea level
and at 10,413 ft above sea level. The results obtained with the candidate system were compared
to those obtained with the laboratory comparator method (YSI 2300 STAT PLUS Glucose and
L-Lactate Analyzer). The results support the claims that the TeleRPM Gen2 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System functions as intended at altitudes up to the claimed altitude of 10,413 feet.
4. Sample Volume (Detection) Study:
The sponsor conducted a sample volume study using venous blood samples prepared at three
glucose range intervals at three glucose levels (62.2, 110.5, and 225.0 mg/dL) that were tested
at different sample volumes (0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 μL). The results obtained with the candidate
system were compared to those obtained with the laboratory comparator method (YSI 2300
STAT PLUS Glucose and L-Lactate Analyzer). The results support the claimed sample volume
of 0.8 μL and demonstrate that the insufficient sample volume error feature functions as
intended with sample volumes less than 0.8 μL.
5. Flex Studies:
The following additional flex studies were performed with the candidate system: sample
perturbation, testing with used test strips, test strip early removal, intermittent sampling, shock
and vibration, low battery, shipping and handling simulation, meter environmental temperature
and recharging temperature limit. The results demonstrated that the performance of the
TeleRPM Gen2 blood glucose monitoring system is robust under these expected use
conditions.
6. Infection Control Studies: The device system is intended for single patient use only.
Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the external meter materials by an outside
commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of Duck hepatitis B virus-
a surrogate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Healthcare Bleach
Germicidal Wipes (EPA Registration #67619-12). A robustness study was also conducted by
the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance nor in the external
materials of the meter after 608 cleaning and disinfection cycles using the Clorox Healthcare

Bleach Germicidal Wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-
patient device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning
and disinfection procedures.
7. Electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing had been performed and the
TelePM Gen2 blood glucose monitoring system was found to be compliant.
8. Software and cybersecurity documentation was reviewed and found to be acceptable.
9. Test strip Lot release: The test strip lot release protocol and acceptance criteria for the release
of the TeleRPM blood glucose test strips for use with the TelePM Gen2 blood glucose
monitoring system were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
