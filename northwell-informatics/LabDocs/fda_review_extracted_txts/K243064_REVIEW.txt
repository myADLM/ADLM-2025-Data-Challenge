A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The ETERBIO Fentanyl/Norfentanyl Rapid Test (Colloidal Gold) is an immunoassay intended
for the qualitative detection of Fentanyl (FTY) /Norfentanyl (NFTY) in human urine:
Drug (Identifier) Calibrator Cut-off Level
Fentanyl (FYL) Fentanyl 1ng/mL
Norfentanyl (NFYL) Norfentanyl 5ng/mL
The test is available as a single panel for FYL or NFYL, or as a dual panel combining both FYL
and NFYL. It provides a preliminary screening result only. For a confirmed analytical outcome,
a more specific chemical method is required. GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory
method.
The ETERBIO Fentanyl/Norfentanyl Home Test is an immunoassay intended for the qualitative
detection of Fentanyl (FTY) /Norfentanyl (NFTY) in human urine:
Drug (Identifier) Calibrator Cut-off Level
Fentanyl (FYL) Fentanyl 1ng/mL
Norfentanyl (NFYL) Norfentanyl 5ng/mL
The test is available as a single panel for FYL or NFYL, or as a dual panel combining both FYL
and NFYL. This test provides only preliminary results. For a confirmed analytical outcome, a
more specific chemical method is required. GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory
method.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ETERBIO Fentanyl/Norfentanyl Rapid Test (Colloidal Gold) is an immunoassay designed
for the qualitative detection of Fentanyl (FTY) and Norfentanyl (NFTY) in human urine. The test
is available as a single panel for FTY or NFTY, or as a dual panel that detects both analytes.
Each ETERBIO fentanyl/norfentanyl urine test device consists of a Test Panel and a package
insert. Each Test Panel is sealed with sachets of desiccant in an aluminum pouch.
B Principle of Operation:
K243064 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
The ETERBIO Fentanyl/Norfentanyl Rapid Test (Colloidal Gold) is an immunoassay based on
the principle of competitive binding. During the testing process, the urine specimen migrates
through the test strip via capillary action. If the concentration of the target drug in the specimen
is below the specified cutoff level, the binding sites of the antibody-coated particles in the test
device remain unsaturated. As a result, these antibody-coated particles are captured by the
immobilized drug conjugate, leading to the appearance of a visible colored line in the test line
region.
However, if the drug concentration exceeds the cutoff level, the drug will fully saturate the
binding sites of the anti-drug antibodies, preventing the formation of a colored line in the test
line region.
A procedural control is built into the test, indicated by the consistent appearance of a colored line
in the control line region. This confirms that the appropriate volume of specimen has been added
and that the membrane wicking process has occurred correctly.

A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cut off, -75%
cut off, -50% cut off, -25% cut off, cut off, +25% cut off, +50% cut off, +75% cut off and
+100% cut off for each target drug. These samples were prepared by spiking fentanyl or
norfentanyl in negative urine samples. Each fentanyl or norfentanyl concentration was
confirmed by LC/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared
the samples and didn’t take part in the sample testing. Three operators tested blinded urine
samples over a 10-day period in randomized order with six tests per day per concentration
per operator (2 replicates x 3 lots per day x 9 concentrations) for a total of 54 tests per day
per operator.

or urine samples with pH 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 were spiked with targets fentanyl and norfentanyl
at 50% below and 50% above Cut-Off levels. These samples were tested using three lots of
device. Results were all positive for samples at and above +50% Cut- Offs and all negative
for samples at and below -50% Cut-Offs.
Read Time Study:
Fentanyl and Norfentanyl Standards with concentrations of -50% cutoff, +50% cutoff, and
drug free urine were tested using three lots of the device and read at 10 time points (i.e. 3rd,
4th, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, 30th, 35th, 40th minutes) by three different operators
according to procedures in the product insert. All the results were consistent with the required
reading time at 5 minutes and not more than 10 minutes.
4. Assay Reportable Range:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section VII.A.1 above.
5. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
All drug calibrators of the device are traceable to available commercial reference materials.
6. Detection Limit:
Characterization of how the device performs at low concentrations appears in the precision
section, VII.A.1, above.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section, VII.A.1, above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Method comparison studies for the ETERBIO Fentanyl/Norfentanyl Urine Rapid Test Panel
were performed by three different operators. Operators ran 80 (40 negative and 40 positive)

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
A lay user study was performed at three testing sites representative of intended use sites
with 140 lay users. The lay users had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and
ranged in age from 18 to >50 years. Three lots of the device were used in the study. Urine
samples were prepared at the following concentrations: -100%, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of
the cut-offs by spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations
of the samples were confirmed by LC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual
containers, blind-labeled and randomized. Each participant was provided with the package
insert, 1 blind labeled sample and a device. The results are summarized below:
