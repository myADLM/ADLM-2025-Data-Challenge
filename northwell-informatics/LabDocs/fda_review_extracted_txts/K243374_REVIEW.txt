B Indication(s) for Use:
HemosIL CL HIT-lgG is a qualitative, fully automated, chemiluminescent immunoassay
(PF4-H)
(CIA) for the detection of IgG antibodies that react with Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) when complexed
to heparin. The assay is for use in human 3.2% citrated plasma on the ACL TOP 970 CL in a
laboratory setting.
The result provided by the assay should be interpreted as either positive or negative based on the
assay cut-off (1.00 U/mL). The positive or negative result aids in determining the risk for
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) when used in conjunction with other laboratory and
clinical findings.
Anti-PF4/Heparin antibodies are commonly found in patients with HIT. For use in adult
population suspected of HIT. Not for use in isolation to exclude HIT.
For prescription use only.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
ACL TOP 970 CL (K221359)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The HemosIL CL HIT-IgG kit consists of:
(PF4-H)
• CL HIT-IgG Cartridge: 1 cartridge containing 1 vial of magnetic particle suspension
(PF4-H)
coated with PF4/PVS complex, 1 vial of assay buffer, 1 vial of tracer consisting of an mAb
anti-human IgG antibody labeled with isoluminol, and 1 vial of sample diluent used for the
regular predilution of the sample. The reagents are in a phosphate or HEPES buffer
containing bovine serum albumin, bovine fetal serum, PF4/PVS complex, mouse
monoclonal IgG, stabilizers, and preservative.
• CL HIT-IgG Calibrator 1: 1 x 1.2 mL barcoded vial of a solution with humanized mAb
(PF4-H)
anti-PF4-Heparin in Tris buffer containing bovine serum albumin, stabilizers and
preservative.
• CL HIT-IgG Calibrator 2: 1 x 1.2 mL barcoded vial of a solution with humanized mAb
(PF4-H)
anti-PF4-Heparin in Tris buffer containing bovine serum albumin, stabilizers, and
preservative.
The calibrators are lot specific, and they cannot be used with other lots of reagents.
B Principle of Operation:
HemosIL CL HIT-lgG assay is a chemiluminescent two-step immunoassay consisting of
(PF4-H)
magnetic particles coated with PF4 complexed to polyvinyl sulfonate (PVS) which capture
PF4/H antibodies from the sample, if present.
After incubation, magnetic separation, and a wash step, a tracer consisting of an isoluminol-
labeled anti-human IgG antibody is added and may bind with the captured PF4/H IgG on the
K243374 - Page 2 of 12

--- Page 3 ---
particles. After a second incubation, magnetic separation, and a wash step, reagents that trigger
the luminescent reaction are added, and the emitted light is measured as relative light units
(RLUs) by the ACL TOP 970 CL optical system. The RLUs are directly proportional to the
PF4/H IgG concentration in the sample.
The HemosIL CL HIT-lgG assay utilizes a 4 Parameter Logistic Curve fit (4PLC) data
(PF4-H)
reduction method to generate a Master Curve. The Master Curve is predefined and lot dependent
and it is stored in the instrument through the cartridge barcode. With the measurement of
calibrators, the predefined Master Curve is transformed to a new, instrument specific 4PLC
Working Curve. The concentration values of the calibrators are included in the reagent kit
calibrator value sheet 2D barcode.

(PF4-H)
4. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Interference study was conducted using a paired-bias approach testing each potential
interfering substance on either two or three lots of HemosIL CL HIT-IgG on a
(PF4-H)
minimum of one ACL TOP 970 CL at three sample levels for each substance: baseline (no
interfering substance), at the intended claim, and at 20% above the intended claim (or C0,
Cmax, and Cmax+20%, respectively). Interfering substances were tested in three citrated
plasma pools (Negative, MDL, and High Positive) with a minimum of 14 replicates per
sample.
A dose-response interference study was performed for unfractionated heparin (UFH), low
molecular weight heparin (LMWH), rheumatoid factor (RF), fondaparinux, and protamine.
Five levels of each interferent were tested in three citrated plasma pools (Negative, MDL, and
High Positive), with five (5) replicates per each level.
A cross-reactivity study was conducted with 24 patients diagnosed with Antiphospholipid
Syndrome (APS) and 20 patient samples negative for APS. Samples were tested with one lot
of HemosIL CL HIT-IgG on the ACL TOP 970 CL.
(PF4-H)
The results of the above studies demonstrate that the HemosIL CL HIT-IgG on the
(PF4-H)
ACL TOP 970 CL analyzer is not affected by the interferents up to the levels indicated in
table below:

Not applicable
6. Traceability, Stability, Expected Values (Controls, Calibrators, or Methods):
Traceability
There is currently no International Standard available for Anti‐PF4/Heparin (PF4/H)
antibodies; therefore, each manufacturer must establish their own internal standardization
and reportable units. Two different types of calibrator materials are prepared for the
HemosIL CL HIT‐IgG assay standardization:

Antiphospholipid Syndrome	Twenty-four citrated plasma samples from patients
diagnosed with Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)
were tested with the HemosIL CL HIT-IgG assay
(PF4-H)
and four commercially available antiphospholipid
antibody assays (anti-cardiolipin IgG, anti-cardiolipin
IgM, anti-β2 glycoprotein I IgG, anti-β2 glycoprotein I
IgM). Three out of the twenty-four samples recovered
above the cut-off of 1.00 U/mL (positive) for HemosIL
CL HIT-IgG . These three samples also tested
(PF4-H)
positive for anti-cardiolipin IgG but tested negative for
the other three antiphospholipid assays.

• Kit Calibrators: Used by the ACL TOP 970 CL instrument to prepare the Working
Calibration Curve
HemosIL CL HIT-IgG is standardized to Internal Primary Reference Material
(PF4-H)
(humanized monoclonal anti PF4-Heparin antibody diluted in Tris-buffer containing negative
human serum, stabilizers, and preservative). The Primary Reference Materials are shared
among HemosIL CL HIT-IgG and HemosIL AcuStar HIT-IgG (K170854). The
(PF4-H) (PF4-H)
values were initially set on HemosIL AcuStar HIT-IgG according to the following
(PF4-H)
process: A population of HIT suspected samples was studied and a Receiver Operating
Characteristics (ROC) analysis vs Serotonin Release Assay (SRA) showed a clear separation
of negative and positive results with an optimal sensitivity and specificity using a cut-off of
1.00 U/mL. This same value was proposed for HemosIL CL HIT-IgG which was
(PF4-H)
confirmed as optimal with a validation cut-off study on HemosIL CL HIT-IgG assay
(PF4-H)
using a population of HIT suspected samples and assessing the overall agreement vs SRA.
Expected values
The Kit Calibrators (component of assay test kit) are prepared and assigned versus internal
Primary Reference Material (RMI). The assigned concentration is obtained for each
calibrator by analyzing the Kit Calibrators being manufactured referenced to their respective
internal Primary Reference Material over multiple runs and instruments.
The assigned concentration must fall within the following acceptability ranges:
• Calibrator 1: 1.00 ± 0.24 U/mL
• Calibrator 2: 16.50 ± 3.30 U/mL
Reagent stability
Reagent real-time shelf-life stability and continuous on-board stability testing was conducted
using three (3) lots of HemosIL CL HIT-IgG reagent cartridges with a panel of four
(PF4-H)
citrated plasma samples (two sample pools and two unadulterated samples) and two control
levels (low and high) at different time points, spanning the claimed stability range. Each
material was analyzed in 13 replicates and compared to the results obtained from baseline
day 0. The reagent stability study results support the following claim:
• On-Board Stability was established at 30 days for the HemosIL CL HIT-IgG at
(PF4-H)
2–8°C continuously on-board the ACL TOP 970 CL.
• Shelf-life was established at 12 months for the HemosIL CL HIT-IgG when
(PF4-H)
stored at 2–8 °C.
Calibrator stability
The calibrator on-board was conducted with three (3) lots of HemosIL CL HIT-IgG
(PF4-H)
calibrators (1 & 2) by performing one calibration at different time points (0, 2, 4 and 5 hours)
after the placement of the assay calibrators on board the ACL TOP 970 CL. Each of the
HemosIL CL Multi-Ab Controls (control low and control high) was analyzed with 11
replicates. The calibrator open-vial stability studies was conducted with three (3) lots of
HemosIL CL HIT-IgG calibrators (1 & 2A) first placed on board the ACL TOP 970 CL
(PF4-H)
for 1 hour and then re-capped and placed at +2-8°C. Calibrations were performed at time 0,
14 days, and 15 days (at +2-8°C) with 10 replicates each of Multi-Ab Control (Low and
K243374 - Page 9 of 12

--- Page 10 ---
High). The mean values obtained for each Multi-Ab Control at each time point were
compared versus the corresponding mean values obtained with the calibration at time 0.
The calibrator on-board and open-vial study results support that the calibrators are stable for
4 hours on-board the ACL TOP 970 CL in the open original vial or 14 days at 2–8 ºC in the
closed original vial.
Transport stability
A shipping (transport simulation) study was conducted using a total of 30 kits of HemosIL
CL HIT-IgG which were packed in two boxes (15 kits per box) at two stressed transport
(PF4-H)
conditions. The data collected from these two shipment conditions were compared to non-
stressed kits (reference kits) which were continuously maintained at the recommended
storage condition of 2–8°C. The results support warm shipment: Two days at room
temperature (15–30°C), three days at 37°C in heater followed by 2–8°C storage until testing.
HemosIL CL HIT-IgG does not tolerate freezing conditions. A temperature logging
(PF4-H)
device is always included in the packaging to ensure that kits can be deemed valid on receipt.
Sample Stability
The sample stability study was performed to support the recommended storage and handling
instructions found in the device labeling. Three (3) citrated plasma samples (negative sample,
MDL sample and high positive sample) were tested at 2–8ºC and 15–25ºC. The study was
performed using one reagent lot, with thirteen (13) replicate measurements at each time point
for each sample on one ACL TOP 970 CL instrument. The study data demonstrate that
citrated plasma samples can be stored at 2–8°C and 15–25°C for 8 hours before testing with
the HemosIL CL HIT-IgG assay.
(PF4-H)
7. Detection Limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) studies were performed using
three different lots of HemosIL CL HIT-IgG reagents on two ACL TOP 970 CL
(PF4-H)
instruments, according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoB and LoD were established at 0.09 U/mL
and 0.14 U/mL, respectively.
8. Assay Cut-Off:
Refer to section D. Clinical Cut-Off.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
The method comparison study was conducted at three U.S. sites with 341 samples from
intended use population with confirmed medical history of a suspicion of HIT and
calculation of a 4T score. Each sample was run in singlicate using the candidate assay on the
ACL TOP 970 CL instrument and the predicate assay on the ACL AcuStar instrument
(K170854).

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Reference Interval – Healthy Donors Not Heparin Exposed: A total of 122 citrated plasma
samples from ostensibly healthy donors with an age range of 20 to 71 years old were tested with
two lots of HemosIL CL HIT-IgG(PF4-H) on one ACL TOP 970 CL instrument. The data were
analyzed using the non-parametric quantile interval based on the order statistics. The reference
interval was calculated, and the upper limit determined to be 0.45 U/mL (90% CI: 0.28 to 0.68
U/mL).
Reference Interval – Heparin Exposed, Not- HIT Suspected Patients (HIT Negative):
A total number of 132 samples from patients exposed to heparin (UFH and LMWH) but not
suspected of HIT with an age range of 21 to 88 years old were tested with two lots of HemosIL
CL HIT-IgG(PF4-H) on one ACL TOP 970 CL instrument. The statistical method applied to
analyze the data was the non-parametric quantile interval based on the order statistics. The
reference interval was calculated, and the upper limit determined to be 1.42 U/mL (90% CI: 0.49
to 3.88 U/mL).
