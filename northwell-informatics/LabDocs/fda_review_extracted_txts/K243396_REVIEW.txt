C Type of Test:
This assay is a nucleic acid amplification test that uses Transcription Mediated Amplification
(TMA), and Dual Kinetic Assay (DKA) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay is a nucleic acid amplification in vitro diagnostic test intended for
the qualitative detection of RNA from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2) isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and anterior nasal (AN) swabs
obtained from patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of COVID-19.
Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The Aptima SARS-CoV-2
Assay is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19 if used in conjuction with other
clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory findings. Clinical correlation with patient history and
other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status. Positive results do
not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses.
Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis
for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations,
patient history, and epidemiological information.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
For in vitro diagnostic use only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use with the Panther and Panther Fusion System only.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay is an in vitro diagnostic test intended for qualitative detection
of RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal and anterior
nasal swab specimens obtained from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of COVID-19.
The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay involves four main steps: target capture, transcription-mediated
amplification (TMA), Hybridization Protection Assay (HPA), and dual kinetic assay (DKA)
detection. Nucleic acid capture takes place in a single tube of a Multi-Tube Unit (MTU) on
Panther systems. The captured nucleic acid is combined with amplification reagents. TMA is
then performed for the captured nucleic acid on the Panther system. Acridinium Ester (AE)
labeled probe oligos bind to the generated amplicon, resulting in light emission. The Panther
K243396 - Page 2 of 20

--- Page 3 ---
system compares the relative light unit (RLU) to a predetermined cut-off to produce a qualitative
result for the presence or absence of the analyte. Dual Kinetic Assay (DKA) technology enables
multiplex detection from a single sample.
Results Reporting
The system software assesses the validity of all samples including controls. The user
interprets results generated based on Table 1, which is included in the Aptima SARS-CoV-2
Assay package insert.

B Principle of Operation:
The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay combines the technologies of target capture, Transcription
Mediated Amplification (TMA), and Dual Kinetic Assay (DKA).
Specimens are collected and transferred into their respective specimen transport tubes. The
transport solutions in these tubes release the RNA target and protect them from degradation
during storage. When the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay is performed in the laboratory, the target
RNA molecules are isolated from specimens by use of capture oligomers via target capture that
utilizes magnetic microparticles. The capture oligomers contain sequences complementary to
specific regions of the target molecules as well as a string of deoxyadenosine residues. A
separate capture oligomer is used for each target. During the hybridization step, the sequence
specific regions of the capture oligomers bind to specific regions of the target molecules. The
capture oligomer:target complex is then captured out of solution by decreasing the temperature
of the reaction to room temperature. This temperature reduction allows hybridization to occur
between the deoxyadenosine region on the capture oligomer and the poly-deoxythymidine
molecules that are covalently attached to the magnetic particles. The microparticles, including
the captured target molecules bound to them, are pulled to the side of the reaction vessel using
magnets and the supernatant is aspirated. The particles are washed to remove residual specimen
matrix that may contain amplification reaction inhibitors. After the target capture steps are
completed, the specimens are ready for amplification.
Target amplification assays are based on the ability of complementary oligonucleotide primers to
specifically anneal and allow enzymatic amplification of the target nucleic acid strands. The
Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay replicates specific regions of the RNA from SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Detection of the RNA amplification product sequences (amplicon) is achieved using nucleic acid
hybridization. Single-stranded chemiluminescent nucleic acid probes, which are unique and
complementary to a region of each target amplicon and Internal Control (IC) amplicon, are
labeled with different acridinium ester (AE) molecules. The AE-labeled probes combine with the
amplicon to form stable hybrids. The Selection Reagent differentiates hybridized from
unhybridized probe, eliminating the generation of signal from the unhybridized probe. During
the detection step, light emitted from the labeled hybrids is measured as photon signals in a

luminometer and are reported as Relative Light Units (RLU). In DKA, differences in the kinetic
profiles of the labeled probes allow for the differentiation of signal; kinetic profiles are derived
from measurements of photon output during the detection read time.
The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay amplifies and detects two conserved regions of the ORF1ab
gene in the same reaction, using the “glower” kinetic type. The two regions are not differentiated
and amplification of either or both regions lead to RLU signal. The assay results are determined
by a cut-off based on the total RLU and the kinetic curve type.
C Instrument Description Information:
1. Instrument Name:
Panther or Panther Fusion system, software version 7.2.7 and 7.2.9
2. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is entered via barcode.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens and anterior nasal swab (ANS) specimens collected
in transport media.
4. Calibration:
Real Time Fluorometers (RTF) undergo a single calibration during manufacturing. No
additional calibration is performed by the end user.
5. Quality Control:
In order to generate valid results, a set of assay controls must be tested. Two types of controls
are provided: one negative control; and one positive control. One replicate of the negative
assay control and one replicate of positive assay control must be tested each time a new kit is
loaded on the system or when the current set of valid controls have expired.
An internal control is added to each sample with the working Target Capture Reagent
(wTCR) and is co-extracted and co-amplified with the target nucleic acid. During processing,
the internal control acceptance criteria are automatically verified by the Panther system
software.
Detection of the internal control is not required for samples that are positive for SARS-CoV-
2. The internal control must be detected in all samples that are negative for SARS-CoV-2
targets; samples that fail to meet that criteria will be reported as Invalid. Each sample with an
Invalid result must be retested. Both types of controls must generate results within predefined
specifications to be valid

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
a. Precision
Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay within-lab precision was evaluated with a 4-member panel
consisting of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in negative clinical NP swab VTM/UTM
matrix. The 4-member panel included a Negative, a High Negative (0.1x LoD), a Low
Positive (1x LoD) and a Moderate Positive (5x LoD) panel. The panels were tested by
two operators, across three panther systems, using three reagent lots, with two runs per
day over six days for a minimum of 36 runs per panel. Each of the four panels was tested
in three replicates per run for a total of 108 replicates per panel.
A total of 39 runs were completed for this study. Two runs were invalid due to sample
dispense verification failures of the negative control for an invalid rate of 5.1%. Both
invalid runs were repeated. Of the total 433 tests completed in the 37 valid runs, there
was one invalid test due to a volume verification failure error. The test was repeated in
the same run and was valid upon retest. The invalid reaction rate was 0.2% (1/433).
The agreement with expected results was 100% in the Negative, Low Positive and
Moderate Positive panel members. The High Negative panel member was 10x below the
assay LoD, therefore a mix of positive and negative results were expected. This panel had
K243396 - Page 7 of 20

68/108 (63%) positive results. Agreement with expected results for all four panels is
shown in Table 2.

Moderate Positive 5.0x LoD (0.05) 100% (108/108) 1147 100% (96.6-100)
The total SARS-CoV-2 signal variability measured as %CV ranged from 2.75% to 3.84%
in Negative, Low Positive, and Moderate Positive panel members. For the sources of
variation all six factors evaluated had %CV values <3.0% as shown in Table 3. The High
Negative panel member is 10x below the assay LoD and the %CV for this panel is
expected to be higher than the others. The highest source of variability for this panel was
within-run variability.

b. Reproducibility
Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay reproducibility was evaluated at three US sites using one
negative and two positive panel members. Testing was performed using one lot of assay
reagents and six operators (two at each site). At each site, testing was performed for at
least five days. Each run had three replicates of each panel member. A negative panel
member was created using pooled negative clinical NP swab specimens in VTM/UTM
processed into tubes containing specimen transport media (STM). Positive panel
members were created by spiking 1-2x LoD (low positive) or 3-5x LoD (moderate
positive) concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 inactivated virus into the clinical negative
matrix.
A total of 32 runs were performed with two invalid runs at one site for an invalid run rate
of 6.3%. All 270 samples processed in valid runs had valid results for an invalid reaction
rate of 0.0%. Table 4 shows the agreement by site and overall agreement with expected

a. Wet-Testing
This study was performed to determine the analytical reactivity of the Aptima SARS-
CoV-2 Assay with clinically relevant strains of the assay target. Panels were prepared by
spiking cultured viral stock into pooled negative clinical NP swabs in VTM/UTM
processed into tubes containing STM. Panels were prepared at a minimum of 3x LoD for
each strain individually and tested in triplicate. Higher concentrations were tested if
<100% detection was observed at 3x LoD. The strains evaluated and the lowest
concentration that achieved 100% reactivity are shown in Table 6 below.

*Strain used to establish LoD.
1In silico analysis showed 100% homology to amplification regions.
2In silico analysis identified a single mismatch in the probe oligo for one region. Due to the location of the mismatch
and 100% homology to the second region, detection is not expected to be impacted.
The results from this study demonstrate that the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay is capable
of detecting multiple clinically relevant strains of SARS-CoV-2.
b. In silico
The inclusivity of the Aptima SARS-C0V-2 Assay was evaluated using in silico analysis
of the forward, revers primers, and probes compared to available gene databases
(GISAID and NCBI). All available sequences up to January 31, 2024 from the GISAID
and NCBI gene databases were evaluated. Due to the high volume (>14 million) of
SARS-CoV-2 sequences available in the NCBI and GISAID, a subset of at least 10% of
available sequences up to July 31, 2023 and all sequences from August 1, 2023 – January
31, 2024 were analyzed from each database. To reduce sampling bias, each subset was
chosen at random from each source. The sequences evaluated include lineages and
variants of concern (VOC) or variants under investigation (VUI) that may have important
epidemiological, immunological, or pathogenic properties from the public health
perspective.

Sequence alignments were generated using the multiple sequence alignment program
MAFFT (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform). All non-human isolates as
well as partial sequences that do not span the amplicon regions of the assay were
removed. Additionally, any sequence with missing or ambiguous sequence information
for the target region was removed. Due to the dual amplification systems for SARS-CoV-
2, only sequences with mismatches in both regions were assessed for potential impact to
the inclusivity of the assay.
Bases on the in silico analysis of GISAID and NCBI sequences available for SARS-CoV-
2 up to January 31, 2024, the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay is predicated to detect 99.98%
(2,136,815/2,137,175) of all evaluated sequences.
Cross-Reactivity/Microbial Interference
a. Wet-Testing
This study evaluated the analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) and microbial
interference for the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay in the presence of closely related or
commonly encountered organisms found in a respiratory tract specimen. Panels of 49
organisms were tested in processed negative clinical NP swab VTM/ UTM matrix. To
evaluate cross-reactivity, each panel member was evaluated in triplicate in the absence of
the target organism. To evaluate microbial interference, each panel was tested in triplicate
in the presence of 3x LoD SARS-CoV-2. The organisms evaluated are shown below in
Table 7. Bacteria were tested at 106 CFU/mL and viruses were tested at 105 TCID /mL,
50
except where noted. No cross-reactivity or microbial interference was observed at the
concentrations tested.

2Cultured virus and whole genome purified nucleic acid for Human coronavirus HKU1 and SARS-coronavirus were not readily
available at the time testing was performed. Human coronavirus HKU1 and SARS-coronavirus IVTs corresponding to the
ORF1ab gene regions targeted by the assay were used to evaluate cross-reactivity and microbial interference.
3In place of evaluating pooled human nasal wash, testing of 30 individual negative clinical NP swab specimens was performed to
represent diverse microbial flora in the human respiratory tract.
Interfering Substances
This study evaluated the performance of the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay in the presence of
endogenous and exogenous substances that may be encountered in clinical specimens. The assay
was evaluated with potentially interfering substances in the presence and absence of the target
analyte. For analyte negative samples, potential interfering substances were added to pooled
clinical negative NP swab specimens in VTM/UTM. For analyte positive samples, potentially
interfering substances and SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 3x LoD was added to negative NP
swab specimens in VTM/UTM. Three replicates were tested in the presence and absence of
SARS-CoV-2 for each pool. The substances evaluated are listed in Table 8 below. All target-
positive panels were 100% positive and all target negative panels were 100% negative. The study
results indicate that none of the evaluated substances interfered with the Aptima SARS-CoV-2
Assay at the concentrations tested.

6. Detection Limit:
Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens in VTM/UTM
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of detection or LoD) of the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay
was determined by spiking heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020; BEI
Resources; NR-52281) into pooled negative NP swab matrix to create serial dilutions. To
determine the preliminary LoD, each dilution was tested in replicates of ten with two
reagent lots. The best performing concentration of the two lots was chosen as the
preliminary LoD. The LoD was confirmed at 0.01 TCID /mL by testing at minimum 30
50
replicates. Confirmed LoD concentrations for heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 are
summarized in Table 9 below.
Additionally, the LoD of inactivated SARS-CoV-2, (NIBSC, 20/146) was determined.
The LoD was determined by spiking into pooled negative clinical NP swabs in
VTM/UTM matrix at multiple concentrations. Testing was conducted with three reagent
lots, with a minimum of eight replicated tested per panel concentration per reagent lot for
a minimum of 24 replicates. Probit analysis was then performed for each reagent lot. The
final LoD was determined to be the highest value between the three reagent lots tested
that produced ≥95% positivity. Confirmed LoD concentrations for inactivated SARS-
CoV-2 was determined to be 87.5 IU/mL.

Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens in RespDirect Collection Kit (eSTM)
This study evaluated the analytical sensitivity (LoD) of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2
(NIBSC, code 20/146) in the RespDirect collection kit containing eSTM. Positive and
negative panels were prepared using pooled negative clinical NP swab matrix collected
with the RespDirect Collection Kit. Positive panels were prepared by diluting inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 to 1x LoD, 0.5 log below the LoD and 1 log below the LoD previously
established with the VTM/UTM. A total of 24 replicates were tested for each panel. The
established LoD from the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay with VTM/UTM in STM was
confirmed with ≥ 95% detection at LoD and <95% at 0.5 log below the LoD. Results are

7. Assay Cut-Off:
The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay determines the presence/absence of analyte and control by
utilizing the Kinetic Differentiation Test (KDT). The analyte and internal control are
assigned fluorescent probes with two different kinetic signatures (glower or flasher
respectively). The signal output of these fluorescent probes is measured in Relative Light
Units (RLU). RLU output over time generates a kinetic curve and the area under the curve
represents the total signal (total RLU). To assign positive or negative status, KDT determines
the kinetic curve type and then the total RLU is compared to predetermined RLU cutoffs.
The SARS-CoV-2 RLU cutoffs were determined by processing a range of known samples
representing positive and negative samples. For the SARS-CoV-2 analyte, positivity was
based on glower or dual kinetic (glower and flasher) interpretation combined with a
minimum RLU value. The analyte positive cutoff was approached by ROC analysis, with the
value refined based on mean and standard deviation from a known positive population.
Validity of the negative sample was based on unambiguous kinetic activity associated with
only one fluorescent probe (either glower or flasher) combined with a minimum RLU above
background. If the kinetic interpretation or RLU do not meet these standards, the result is
“Invalid”. The established SARS-CoV-2 RLU cutoffs were validated in the analytical and
clinical studies described in this memo.

9. Carry-Over:
The purpose of this study was to determine the carryover contamination rate of the Aptima
SARS-CoV-2 Assay. The carryover contamination rate was established by testing high titer
concentrations SARS-CoV-2 panels interspersed with negative panels in a checkerboard
pattern. Hight titer panels were prepared by spiking inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus at a high
concentration into pooled negative clinical NP swab VTM/UTM processed into tubes
containing STM. The SARS-CoV-2 negative panel consisted of negative STM. Testing was
conducted on three Panther systems and one lot of Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay reagents,

Checkerboard layouts consisted of alternating positive and negative samples with 49 negative
samples and 49 positive samples, for a total of 100 tests including controls. Testing was
conducted over three days. All negative samples in all baseline runs tested negative for
SARS-CoV-2 with a positive rate of 0.0%. All high titer positive samples tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 and all negative panels tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 indicating no carry-
over was observed.

a. Transport Media Equivalency Study
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that equivalency between viral transport
media (VTM) types when used with the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay. The following
media types were included in the study: Remel Micro Test M4RT, Remel Micro Test M5,
Remel Micro Test M6, BD Universal Viral Transport Media, Copan Universal Transport
Medium, and Hardy Diagnostics Viral Transport Media. To demonstrate equivalency
between the viral transport medias, samples were created by spiking inactivated SARS-
CoV-2, (NIBSC, 20/146) at four concentrations (negative, 0.2x, 1.5x, and 5x LoD) into
negative simulated VTM/UTM matrices (ex., Remel M4RT transport media spiked with
HeLa cells at 2x104 cells/mL) and negative clinical NP swabs in VTM/UTM. Negative
and contrived positive samples generated with natural clinical NP matrix were included
to demonstrate equivalency between clinical NP matrix and simulated NP matrix,
supporting the use of simulated NP matrix in this study. Twenty (20) replicates per target
concentration were tested for each transport media type and analyte concentration. The
results are shown in Table 11 and support that the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay can be
used with the evaluated viral transport media types.

b. Collection Device Equivalency – RespDirect Collection Kit (eSTM) vs VTM/UTM
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate equivalency of collection methods for NP
swabs and ANS swabs. For this study, three contrived specimen types (NP swab
collected with RespDirect Collection Kit (eSTM-NP), ANS swab collected with
RespDirect Collection Kit (eSTM-NS) and NP swabs collected in VTM/SLT (NP swab
collected in VTM/UTM and processed into SLT (VTM/SLT-NP)) were prepared by
spiking inactivated SARS-CoV-2, (NIBSC, 20/146) into paired, negative clinical NP
eSTM and negative clinical NP VTM/UTM matrix collected from individuals with signs
and symptoms of respiratory infection. Contrived panels were generated at both 2x and
5x LoD. In total, 300 SARS-CoV-2 positives were evaluated. Additionally, 450 negative
samples, consisting of negative clinical NP matrix, only, were included in the study. Five
false positive results were observed (one VTM/SLT-NP and four eSTM-NP specimens).
After retest, all results were negative. These false positive results are potentially due to
environmental contamination. Results are shown in Table 12, below and demonstrate
that the two collection methods are equivalent.

RespDirect Collection Kit and prospective clinical nasopharyngeal samples collected in
UTM/VTM from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection.
Anterior nasal swab specimens were obtained either through healthcare provider (HCP) or
patient self-collection (under HCP direction/observation) in UTM/VTM or eSTM from nine
geographically diverse clinical collection sites. The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay was
evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 performance by comparing its results from anterior nasal swab
specimens in UTM/VTM or in eSTM to a composite comparator algorithm (CCA). The
composite comparator algorithm (CCA) consisted of two highly sensitive U.S. FDA EUA
molecular tests and a validated PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing (PCR/BDS)
assay. A final CCA result was assigned with two of the three composite comparator assays
were in concordance. All comparator testing was performed in accordance with the
respective package inserts. Subject enrollment was between October 25, 2022 and May 1,
2023. A total of 2295 non withdrawn subjects were tested in the study. Of the 2295 subjects
tested, 118 subjects were not evaluable. Of the 118 subjects, 41 subjects had their sample
withdrawn, 31 did not have a valid final Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay result, and 46 had an
unknown CCA result. A total of 2177 subjects were evaluated for the performance analysis,
including 1159 with evaluable ANS specimens in UTM/VTM, and 1018 with evaluable ANS
specimens in RespDirect/eSTM. Demographic information for the 2177 evaluable
individuals is provided in Table 13 below.
Remnant nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected in UTM/VTM in a multicenter
study, procured from clinical specimen supplies. All prospectively collected leftover NP
swab samples were collected during two collection periods: June 2020 through July 2020
(prospectively collected frozen) and January 2023 through April 2023 (prospectively
collected fresh). The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2
performance by comparing its results from NP swab specimens in UTM/VTM to a CCA. A
total of 1646 NP swab specimens were tested in valid Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay runs,
including 9 with initial invalid results. Upon retest, all 1646 specimens yielded final valid
results. Of the 1646 samples obtained, 149 NP swab specimens were excluded from analysis
due to mishandling at the site and two samples were not evaluable due to the unknown CC
result. The final data set consisted of 1495 evaluable NP swab specimens including 1195
tested fresh and 300 tested after freezing. Demographic information for the 1495 evaluable
individuals is provided in Table 14 below.
