IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The test comes in three formats (strip, cassette, and midstream) named FaStep Early Pregnancy
Rapid Test Strip, FaStep Early Pregnancy Rapid Test Cassette, and FaStep Early Pregnancy
Rapid Test Midstream, respectively. The strip format is a single test strip designed to be used in
dip sampling mode only. The cassette format consists of a single test strip assembled in a plastic
housing and is designed to be used in drop sampling mode only. A pipette dropper is included in
the packaging. The midstream format consists of a single test strip assembled in a plastic housing
with an absorbent tip and is designed to be tested in dip or in-stream sampling mode. The result
is displayed in the test window of all formats as two lines for a ‘Pregnant’ positive result and one
line for a ‘Not Pregnant’ negative result.
B Principle of Operation:
FaStep Early Pregnancy Rapid Test Strip, FaStep Early Pregnancy Rapid Test Cassette, and
FaStep Early Pregnancy Rapid Test Midstream use lateral flow immunoassay technology for in
K243573 - Page 2 of 13

--- Page 3 ---
vitro qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in human urine. The devices
utilize a combination of antibodies to detect hCG in urine as well as to serve as a control. Each
device contains mouse monoclonal anti-β-hCG antibody colloidal gold conjugate pre-dried on
the sample pad. Mouse monoclonal anti-α-hCG antibody (on the test line) and goat anti mouse
IgG polyclonal antibody (on the control line) are coated and immobilized on a nitrocellulose
membrane. When the test is performed properly, a colored line will always appear in the control
zone (C). The test result is shown in the result window and read visually within 3-10 minutes of
urine addition. Two distinct colored lines, one in the test zone (T) and another in the control zone
(C) indicate a positive test result (pregnant). Absence of a colored line in the test zone (T) and
only a colored line in the control zone (C) indicates a negative test result (not pregnant). Absence
of a colored line in the control zone (C) even in the presence of a colored line in the test zone (T)
indicates an invalid test result.

Cross-reactivity of Similar Compounds:
To evaluate cross-reactivity, negative urine samples were spiked to contain 0, 5 and 10
mIU/mL hCG and then spiked with potential cross reactants. Samples were then spiked with
500 mIU/mL luteinizing hormone (hLH), 1000 mIU/mL follicle-stimulating hormone
(hFSH), and 1 mIU/mL thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH). The samples were tested in ten
replicates using three device lots by three different operators. No cross-reactivity was
observed at the tested concentrations.
Effects of Urine pH:
To evaluate the effect of urine pH on test results, urine samples containing 0, 5, and 10
mIU/mL hCG were tested at pH values of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0. The samples were
tested in triplicate using three lots of the device by three operators. The results demonstrated
that changes in pH ranging from 4.0 to 9.0 do not interfere with either positive or negative
results from the device.
Effects of Urine Specific Gravity:
To evaluate the effect of urine specific gravity on test results, urine samples containing 0, 5
and, 10 mIU/mL hCG were tested at specific gravities of 1.000, 1.005, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020,
1.025, 1.030 and 1.035. The samples were tested in triplicate using three device lots by three
operators. The results demonstrated that changes in specific gravity ranging from 1.000 to
1.035 do not interfere with either positive or negative results from the device.
Hook Effect:
Negative urine samples were spiked with varying hCG concentrations up to 200,000
mIU/mL. The samples were tested in replicates of five using three device lots by three
operators. All tested concentrations gave a positive result. The results demonstrated that no
hook effect was observed at hCG concentration up to 200,000 mIU/mL.
Effects of hCG β-core fragment:
Urine samples with hCG concentrations of 0, 5, 10, and 20,000 mIU/mL were spiked with
hCG β-core fragment (hCGβcf) at concentrations of 50,000 pmol/L, 125,000 pmol/L,
250,000pmol/L, and 500,000 pmol/L. The samples were tested in replicates of ten using three
lots of the device by three operators. All samples yielded correct results with hCG β-core
fragment concentrations up to 500,000 pmol/L.

6. Detection Limit:
A detection limit study was performed using negative female urine samples spiked with 0, 5,
6, 7.5, 8, 9, 10, 12.5, 15, 20, 25 and 50 mIU/mL hCG (hCG traceable to the 5th WHO IS).
The samples were tested using all three device formats (FaStep Early Pregnancy Rapid Test
Strip, FaStep Early Pregnancy Rapid Test Cassette, and FaStep Early Pregnancy Rapid Test
Midstream (both in-stream and dip modes)). The samples were tested in replicates of 20,
using three device lots of each test format, by three different operators. The claimed
analytical sensitivity or cut-off of the candidate device is 10 mIU/mL hCG.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
The claimed cut-off is 10 mIU/mL. See Detection Limit (Section VII.A.6) and
Precision/Reproducibility (Section VII.A.1) sections above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Urine samples were collected from 321 women who presented at three sites for pregnancy
testing. Approximately half of the subjects were suspected to be pregnant in the early stage of
less than 5 weeks. Ages of these women ranged from 18 to 50 years. Samples were masked
and randomized by people who labeled the samples but did not participate in the testing. A
total of 110 samples were tested for strip format, and 105 samples were tested for cassette
format; 106 samples were tested for the midstream format in both dip sampling mode and in-
stream sampling mode. Samples were tested by medical professionals using both the
candidate and predicate devices. The results are summarized in the tables below.

Specificity Study to Determine False Positive Result Rate:
Urine sampled from 900 non-pregnant females were tested with FaStep Early Pregnancy
Rapid Test Strip, FaStep Early Pregnancy Rapid Test Cassette, and FaStep Early Pregnancy
Rapid Test Midstream (both in-stream and dip modes). Urine samples from non-pregnant
women in pre-menopausal (18-40 years, n=300), peri-menopausal (41-55 years, n=300), and
post-menopausal (>55 years, n=300) age groups were evaluated. In each age group, 100
participants were tested with the strip format, 100 participants were tested with the cassette
format, 50 participants were tested with the midstream format using in-stream sampling
method, and 50 participants tested with the midstream format using dip sampling method.
Three lots of each test format were used in the study. The results are summarized in the
tables below.

3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Detection of hCG in Early Pregnancy Clinical Samples:
A total of 680 urine samples were collected from 68 pregnant women from the intended use
population. The women ranged from 18 to 45 years old, and testing was conducted starting
from 9 days before expected menstrual period to the day of the expected menstrual period
(EMP). Each sample was tested using FaStep Early Pregnancy Rapid Test Strip, FaStep
Early Pregnancy Rapid Test Cassette, and FaStep Early Pregnancy Rapid Test Midstream
(both in-stream and dip sampling modes). Pregnant women were later confirmed to be
pregnant via ultrasound. Representative results are summarized in the table below.
