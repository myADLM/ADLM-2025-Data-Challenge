III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
The ARCHITECT HSV-2 IgG assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay
(CMIA) used for the qualitative detection of specific IgG antibodies to herpes simplex
virus type 2 (HSV-2) in human serum (collected in serum and serum separator tubes) and
plasma (collected in dipotassium EDTA, lithium heparin, and lithium heparin plasma
separator tubes) on the ARCHITECT i System.
The ARCHITECT HSV-2 IgG assay is to be used for testing sexually active adults or
expectant mothers to aid in the presumptive diagnosis of HSV-2 infection. The test results
may not determine the state of active lesions or associated disease manifestations,
particularly for primary infection. The predictive value of a reactive or nonreactive result
depends on the prevalence of HSV-2 infection in the population and the pre-test likelihood
of HSV-2 infection.
NOTE: The performance of the ARCHITECT HSV-2 IgG assay has not been established
for use in the pediatric population, for neonatal screening, or for testing
immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients. The assay has not been FDA cleared
or approved for screening blood or plasma donors.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
D Special Instrument Requirements:
For use with the ARCHITECT i2000SR System.
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The ARCHITECT HSV-2 IgG assay is an automated, two-step immunoassay for the
qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to HSV-2 in human serum and plasma using
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology.
The kit contains different components: Reagent (microparticles, conjugate and assay
diluent), Calibrator, and external Controls (reactive and nonreactive).
Interpretation of results
The cutoff is 1.00 S/CO.
The ARCHITECT HSV-2 IgG test result should be used in conjunction with information
available from clinical evaluation and other diagnostic procedures.
K243575 - Page 2 of 15

--- Page 3 ---
S/CO Interpretation
< 1.00 Nonreactive
≥ 1.00 Reactive
B Principle of Operation:
The specimen is incubated with the assay diluent and microparticles which contain specific
recombinant-gG2 antigen. Antigen-antibody complexes will form if anti-HSV-2 antibodies
are present in the sample. The mixture is washed, and the unbound material is removed.
The
conjugate contains monoclonal anti-human IgG labeled with acridinium-labeled, and is
used to detect HSV-2 IgG in the patient specimen. Anti-human IgG acridinium-labeled
conjugate is added to create a reaction mixture and incubated. Following a wash cycle, Pre-
Trigger and Trigger Solutions are added.
The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit (RLU).
There is a direct relationship between the amount of HSV-2 IgG detected in the sample
and the RLU measured by the system optics.
The presence or absence of HSV-2 IgG in the sample is determined by comparing the
chemiluminescent RLU measured to the cutoff RLU determined from an active calibration.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
A multi-center clinical study was conducted to evaluate the clinical performance of the
ARCHITECT HSV-2 IgG assay. Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent
Agreement (NPA) were determined comparing the performance of the ARCHITECT HSV-
2 IgG assay to a composite comparator method comprised of 3 commercially available
anti-HSV-2 IgG assays where a 2 out of 3 approach was followed to determine the final
composite comparator method result.
A total of 915 specimens, which included sexually active individuals and pregnant females,
were collected prospectively within the United States and tested at 3 independent external
laboratories.
The PPA and NPA results are summarized in the following tables.

The following tube types are acceptable for use with the ARCHITECT HSV-2 IgG
assay:
• Serum
• Serum separator

Not applicable
2. Clinical Specificity
Not Applicable.
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
CDC Panel agreement
The CDC panel consisted of 2 aliquots each of 50 serum samples with unknown HSV-2
status for a total of 100 blind characterized samples.
The ARCHITECT HSV-2 IgG assay demonstrated 100% Positive Percent Agreement
(PPA) for reactive samples (30/30) and 97.14% Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) for
nonreactive samples (68/70) in concordance with the results provided by the CDC.
Low Prevalence Specificity
An additional study was performed to determine the specificity of the ARCHITECT
HSV-2 IgG assay using 139 serum specimens from 16-19 year old individuals in a non-
sexually transmitted disease setting within the US. The ARCHITECT HSV-2 IgG assay

E Expected Values/Reference Range:
Representative performance data are provided in this section. Results obtained in individual
laboratories may vary considering HSV prevalence. The prevalence may vary depending
upon geographical location, age, sex, type of test employed, specimen collection and
handling procedures as well as clinical history of the patient.
It is recommended that each laboratory determine its own reference range based upon its
particular local and population characteristics.
Clinical performance of the ARCHITECT HSV-2 IgG assay was evaluated with samples
collected prospectively from 915 individuals from the intended use population. Of the 915
individuals, there were 670 (73%) females and 245 (27%) males. The median age was 35
years (age range: 14 to 99 years). Testing of the specimens was performed at 3 clinical
testing sites.
The distribution of ARCHITECT HSV-2 IgG reactive and nonreactive results by age and
sex is summarized in the following table.
