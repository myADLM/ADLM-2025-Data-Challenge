Control-IQ+ technology is intended for the management of Type 1 diabetes mellitus in persons 2
years of age and greater and of Type 2 diabetes mellitus in persons 18 years of age and greater.
Control-IQ+ technology is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription.
C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Rx - For Prescription Use Only
Only use U-100 insulin analogs that have been tested and found to be compatible for use in the
pump. Use of insulin with lesser or greater concentration can result in under delivery or over
delivery of insulin. This can cause hypoglycemia (low BG) or hyperglycemia (high BG) events.
When the CGM reading is automatically populated into the bolus calculator, only the current
CGM reading is used to calculate the correction bolus. The trend arrow is not used in the dose
calculation. Speak with your healthcare provider for recommendations on how best to utilize the
arrows for your correction bolus dosing.
Control-IQ+ should not be used in anyone under the age of two years old. Control-IQ+ should
also not be used in patients who require less than a total daily insulin dose of 5 units per day or
who weigh less than 20 pounds, as those are the required minimum values needed in order for
Control-IQ technology to operate safely.
The System is magnetic resonance (MR) unsafe. You must take off your pump, transmitter, and
sensor and leave them outside the procedure room.
DO NOT use Control-IQ+ if you are taking hydroxyurea, a medication used in the treatment of
diseases including cancer and sickle cell anemia. Your Dexcom G6 CGM readings may be
falsely elevated and result in over-delivery of insulin that could result in severe hypoglycemia.
III Device/System Characteristics:
Control-IQ+ technology (Control-IQ+, the device) is a software-only device intended for the
management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The device controls insulin delivery from a
compatible alternate controller enabled insulin pump (ACE pump) based on inputs provided by a
compatible integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM) and inputs provided by the user (e.g.,
carbohydrate intake, exercise, and sleep schedule). Control-IQ+ technology is meant to be
installed on a compatible ACE pump.
Control-IQ+ technology has three different modes: Normal, Sleep, and Exercise. The glucose
targets are not individually customizable in these modes but can change based on the mode
selected. During normal mode, Control-IQ+ technology aims to control glucose within a target
range of 112.5 – 160 mg/dL. During sleep mode, this range is changed to 112.5-120 mg/dL, and
it is changed to 140-160 mg/dL during exercise mode.
Control-IQ+ technology includes an integrated feature whereby iCGM values are automatically
populated into the glucose field of the integrated bolus calculator when Control-IQ+ technology
is active (i.e., the device is operating in closed-loop mode). This feature is disabled when
Control-IQ is turned off.
K243823 - Page 2 of 15

Control-IQ+ technology requires users to input their weight and their total daily insulin
requirement, which should be established with the help of a health care provider before using the
device.

Protocol After consent was signed, eligibility was assessed. Eligible
Overview/Synopsis participants not currently using a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose
monitor (CGM), or not meeting CGM usage requirements,
initiated a run-in phase of 3 to 4 weeks that was customized based
on whether the participant was already a CGM user. Participants
continued to use their personal insulin delivery method (pump or
MDI) during the CGM Run-in.
Participants who skipped or successfully completed the run-in
were randomly assigned 2:1 to an intervention group using t:slim
X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ+ technology and CGM (AID
group) or the control group using the continuation of pre-study
basal-bolus insulin delivery method in conjunction with study
CGM (CGM group).
At randomization and the 13-week visit, a blood sample was
obtained for central lab HbAlc determination. At screening and at
the 13-week visit, patient reported outcomes were completed.
Participants in the AID group were asked to perform 3 meal
challenges and (if found to be medically eligible) 3 exercise
challenges.
Safety Results There was 1 severe hypoglycemia event during the study period
but it was unclear if it was attributable to the device. The subject
was able to treat this appropriately at home.
There were no other severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis
events during the study. There were 25 serious adverse events not
related or unlikely to be related to the study device or treatments.

b – Four participants dropped prior to 13 weeks final visit. The sample for one participant not analyzable. The
sample for one participant was collected outside the pre-specified analysis window and thus not included.
c – Two participants dropped prior to 13 weeks final visit.
d – The difference is AID group – CGM group. Direct likelihood was used to handle missing data. The model
adjusted for the baseline HbA1c and for site as a random effect.
A key secondary endpoint evaluated the non-inferiority of the change in CGM time in range (70
– 180 mg/dL) at baseline to the end of 13 weeks between the intervention group (AID group) and
control group (CGM group). CGM time in range changed from 48± 24% at randomization to 64
± 16% at 13 weeks in the AID group, compared to 51 ± 21% at randomization to 52 ± 21% at 13
weeks for the CGM group. The AID group had a 13-week adjusted group different from the
CGM group of 14% with a 95% confidence interval of 11%, 17%.

Difference (95% CI) [p-value]
a - The model adjusted for the baseline HbA1c and for site as a random effect.
Subgroup analyses support that improvement in HbA1c after 13 weeks of AID use were seen
across the AID group and were greater than from the CGM group and were similar across the
distribution of age, sex, racial or ethnic minorities, diabetes duration, baseline bolus method, and
prior insulin regimen. The table below depicts HbA1c and (SD). N values correspond to week
13.

Challenge Results
During this clinical study, subjects in the AID group participated in 3 meal challenges and 3
exercise challenges.
From the AID group 195 participants completed 567 meal challenges in which no bolus, half
bolus or full bolus was delivered. Of the meal challenges 320 were lunch meals, 209 were dinner
meals and 38 were meals outside of lunch or dinner. The median amount of carbohydrates was
60 grams. During and up to the 4 hours post the meal challenge the CGM time in range increased
from 57% to 66% to 71% for no bolus, half bolus and full bolus respectively.
From the AID group 172 participants completed 511, 60-minute-long exercise challenges, of
which 500 were intensity of mild or moderate. During and for 2 hours after the exercise
challenge there was minimal (less than 0.01%) of time below 70 mg/dL as determined by CGM.
Summary of Human Factors Validation Study
The study was conducted as established in K232382. No differences in critical tasks were
identified between adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). A
summative Human Factors validation was performed and followed FDA recognized standard
IEC 62366-1 as well as the FDA guidance document Applying Human Factors and Usability
Engineering to Medical Devices (February 3, 2016). A summative validation study evaluated a
total of 30 individuals with T2D to ensure individuals can safely and effectively perform critical
tasks associated with the use of Control-IQ+ technology.
VII Proposed Labeling:
