III Intended Use/Indications for Use:
A Intended Use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
B Indication(s) for Use:
CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel: Influenza A/B Typing Kit (VER
2)
The Influenza A/B Typing Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza
Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-
PCR) assays on an in vitro diagnostic real-time PCR instrument that has been FDA-cleared for
use with this kit in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:
• For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B viral RNA in upper respiratory tract
clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS],
nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) and
lower respiratory tract specimens (including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash
[BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture.
• To provide epidemiological information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.
Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal
influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the predominant influenza A viruses in
circulation and during a season when the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant
influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging
influenza A viruses.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not
rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the
definite cause of disease.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should
be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses
and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted
unless a BSL 3E facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to
perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC
Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have
successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.

PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an in vitro diagnostic real-time PCR instrument that has been FDA-
cleared for use with this kit in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:
• For the determination of the genetic lineage of human influenza B viruses as B/Victoria or
B/Yamagata lineage from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical specimens (including
K243931 - Page 3 of 20

--- Page 4 ---
nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal
washes [NW] and dual nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) from human patients with signs
and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;
• To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.
Performance characteristics for influenza B lineage genotyping were established during a season
when influenza B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages were in circulation.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not

CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel: Influenza A/H5 Subtyping
Kit (VER 4)
The Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit contains reagents and controls of the CDC Human Influenza
Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-
PCR) assays on an in vitro diagnostic real-time PCR instrument that has been FDA-cleared for
use with this kit in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:
• For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with influenza A
subtype A(H5) (Asian lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens, conjunctival
swabs, and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors;
• To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.
Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal
influenza viruses A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were the predominant influenza A viruses in
circulation and during a season when the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant
influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging
influenza A viruses.
Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed unless
the patient meets the most current U.S.Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A(H5) specimens. The definitive
identification of influenza A(H5) (Asian lineage) either directly from patient specimens or from
virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological
assessment in consultation with national influenza surveillance experts.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not

IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is used in real-time RT-
PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an in vitro diagnostic real-time PCR system that has been FDA-
cleared for use with this panel. The panel is configured in four separate assay kits: Influenza A/B
Typing Kit, Influenza A Subtyping Kit, Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit, and Influenza
A/H5 Subtyping Kit.
Each assay kit consists of oligonucleotide primers, fluorescently labeled hydrolysis probes, and
controls which are used in rRT-PCR assays for the in vitro qualitative detection and
characterization of influenza virus RNA in mainly respiratory specimens from patients
presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI). Oligonucleotide primers and probes for detection of
influenza A, influenza B, and 2009 influenza A (swine origin) were selected from highly
conserved regions of the matrix (M), non-structural (NS), and nucleoprotein (NP) genes,
respectively. Oligonucleotide primers and probes for characterization and differentiation of
influenza A(H3) and A(H1)pdm09 viruses and genetic lineages of influenza B were selected
from highly conserved regions of their HA genes. Oligonucleotide primers and probes for
characterization and differentiation of avian influenza A(H5) (Asian lineage) viruses were also
selected from highly conserved regions of the HA genes. Oligonucleotide primers and probes to
detect the human RNase P gene (RP) in control samples and clinical specimens is also included
in the panel.

with other emerging influenza A viruses.
Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b
primer and probe sets should not be
performed unless the patient meets the
most current U.S.Department of Health
and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and
epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect
A(H5) specimens. The definitive
identification of influenza A(H5) (Asian

lineage) either directly from patient
specimens or from virus cultures requires
additional laboratory testing, along with
clinical and epidemiological assessment
in consultation with national influenza
surveillance experts.
Negative results do not preclude influenza
virus infection and should not be used as
the sole basis for treatment or other
patient management decisions.
Conversely, positive results do not rule
out bacterial infection or co-infection with
other viruses. The agent detected may not
be the definite cause of disease.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus
is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria
recommended by public health
authorities, specimens should be collected
with appropriate infection control
precautions for novel virulent influenza
viruses and sent to state or local health
department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted unless a BSL 3E
facility is available to receive and culture
specimens.

Two new studies were performed to evaluate the potential impact of exogenous interfering
substances in conjunctival swab specimen matrix. Studies were conducted testing two
common over the counter eye drops containing olopatadine hydrochloride or naphazoline
hydrochloride.
For the first study, to evaluate the effect of the eyedrops on the assay, a set of contrived
specimens (N=5) was constructed with a measured volume of each eyedrop plus influenza
A/American Wigeon/South Carolina/22-000345-001/2021 H5N1 at 2x LoD in conjunctival
swab matrix. An additional set of contrived specimens (N=5) was constructed with a
measured volume of each eyedrop plus influenza A/American Wigeon/South Carolina/22-
000345-001/2021 H5N1 at 2x LoD in VTM and A549 cells (a simulated respiratory matrix in

VTM). Each contrived specimen contains 2.31% Clear Eyes eyedrop (naphazoline
hydrochloride as the main ingredient) and 2.08% Pataday eyedrop (olopatadine
hydrochloride as the main ingredient), and was extracted on the Qiagen EZ1 Advanced XL
with the EZ1 DSP Virus kit, amplified by the Invitrogen SuperScript III Platinum One-Step
Quantitative RT-PCR System (without Rox) and run on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast
Dx PCR platform. Due to a lack of sufficient volume of natural conjunctival swabs, the study
was conducted by mixing both the olopatadine hydrochloride and naphazoline hydrochloride
into a single reaction in this study. Cycle threshold (Ct) results were compared to contrived
specimens tested at 2x LoD without the addition of eyedrops as the control condition. No
interference was observed with the addition of olopatadine hydrochloride and naphazoline
hydrochloride at the concentration tested in either the contrived specimens in natural
conjunctival matrix or the contrived specimens in the simulated respiratory matrix. The
results of this study are presented below.

The second study was performed by adding 5 µl of Pataday (olopatadine hydrochloride as the
main ingredient) or Clear Eyes (naphazoline hydrochloride as the main ingredient) eyedrop
dilutions in molecular-grade-water (2.22% Pataday and 2.46% Clear Eyes, respectively)
directly into the RT-PCR enzyme master mix and tested in 20 replicates to evaluate the effect of
the eyedrop chemistry on the A/H5 assay and determine if autofluorescence is produced due to
the eyedrop additions that could generate a false positive A/H5 assay result. No false positive
A/H5 assay result was observed when the eyedrops were added directly to the RT-PCR
reactions in this study. The results of this study are presented below.

Wigeon/South Carolina/22-000345- 001/2021 H5N1 was performed in a background of
VTM and A549 human lung epithelial cells (a simulated respiratory matrix in VTM). A
5-fold dilution series of the virus was prepared using this simulated matrix as the
diluent. Each dilution step was tested in triplicate using the CDC Flu rRT-PCR Dx
Panel Influenza A/H5 Subtyping kit. The range finding limit of detection was defined as
the viral titer of the last dilution step demonstrating 100% positive results (3/3) in this
experiment. Results demonstrated a preliminary LoD with an approximate titer of 105.5
EID /ml.
50
Due to very limited availability of negative conjunctival swab matrix material, the
estimated preliminary LoD was confirmed by testing replicates at concentrations of 2x
and 5x of preliminary LoD using contrived specimens in either influenza A/H5 negative
conjunctival swab matrix or the simulated respiratory matrix in VTM. Contrived
specimens comprised of either negative conjunctival swab matrix and BPL inactivated
influenza A/American Wigeon/South Carolina/22-000345-001/2021 H5N1 virus or
negative simulated respiratory matrix in VTM and BPL inactivated influenza
A/American Wigeon/South Carolina/22-000345-001/2021 H5N1 virus were constructed
at 2x and 5x of the estimated preliminary LoD. Five replicates of each contrived
specimen type at either 2x LoD or 5x LoD were tested along with 10 negative
specimens for each matrix. Each sample was extracted on the Qiagen EZ1 Advanced
XL with the EZ1 DSP Virus kit, amplified by the Invitrogen SuperScript III Platinum
One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (without Rox) and run on the Applied
Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx PCR platform. Detection levels and Ct values of the
conjunctival swab matrix were similar to that observed in the simulated respiratory
matrix in VTM at both the 2x and 5x LoD concentrations. Based on this data, the LoD
for the conjunctival swab collected in VTM/UTM specimens was determined to be 105.5
EID /ml.

B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Not applicable. See section C “Clinical Studies” for clinical validation data supporting the
addition of a conjuctival swab specimen type for use with the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit,
which is one of the four component assay kits of the CDC Human Influenza Real-Time RT-
PCR Diagnostic Panel.
2. Matrix Comparison:
Not Applicable.
C Clinical Studies:
1. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical sensitivity has not been assessed due to the lack of an FDA-cleared comparator for
A/H5 specific detection and subtyping from conjunctival swabs collected in VTM/UTM
specimens.
2. Clinical specificity:
Clinical Specificity has not been assessed due to the lack of an FDA-cleared comparator for
A/H5 specific detection and subtyping from conjunctival swabs collected in VTM/UTM
specimens.
3. Other Clinical Supportive Data (When 1. and 2. Are Not Applicable):
Human upper respiratory tract (URT) swab specimens, including nasopharyngeal swab
(NPS) specimens, combined nasal swab (NS) and oropharyngeal swab (OS) specimens, NS
and/or OS specimens, as well as human conjunctival swab (CS) specimens were collected by
health care professionals (HCPs) as part of the public health investigations into the outbreaks
of influenza A/H5 in dairy cows and poultry in the US from March to November 2024. All
available URT swab specimens and conjunctival swab (CS) specimens from individuals with
either a presumptive influenza A/H5 positive laboratory result (in any specimen) at the state
public health laboratories, or a strong epidemiological link and clinical suspicion that
indicate suspected influenza A/H5 infection, were sent to the CDC laboratory in Atlanta for
confirmatory testing and evaluation.
URT swab specimens and CS specimens collected from a total of 44 confirmed and two
probable human cases of A/H5N1 from March to November of 2024 were received and
tested using the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel
Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Kit (VER 4) (i.e., the CDC A/H5 assay) at the CDC laboratory in
Atlanta. The influenza A/H5N1 confirmed or probable case status for each case was
K243931 - Page 17 of 20

--- Page 18 ---
adjudicated based on the criteria described in Table VII.A. Classification Table: Criteria for
defining a case of novel influenza A infection included in the Council of State and Territory
Epidemiologists (CSTE) document 24-ID-09, which is titled “Update to Public Health
Reporting and National Notification for Novel Influenza A Virus Infection”
http://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/position_statements_files_2023/24-ID-
09_Novel_Influenza_A.pdf
Of the 44 confirmed human cases and two probable cases of A/H5N1, 42 (95.5%) and two
(100%), respectively, reported conjunctivitis symptoms. While 28 confirmed cases and one
probable case reported both respiratory and/or systemic symptoms and conjunctivitis
symptoms, 16 confirmed cases and one probable case reported conjunctivitis symptoms only.
The mean age of the 46 confirmed and probable cases was 36.5 years (range: 18-57 years).
Due to a field correction of a manufacturing error of the H5b component assay reagents
required for testing and result interpretation using the CDC A/H5 assay, clinical specimens
from nine of the 44 confirmed cases were tested using the CDC A/H5 assay without the H5b
component assay reagents in June and July of 2024. As a result, clinical specimens from
these nine confirmed cases were excluded from performance assessment for the CDC A/H5
assay (i.e., the remaining 35 confirmed cases and two probable cases were included in the
performance assessment).
Of the 35 confirmed cases assessed, 33/35 (94.3%) reported conjunctivitis symptoms. Of
those 33 confirmed cases with conjunctivitis symptoms reported, 26/33 (78.8%) reported a
positive result for A/H5 and 3/33 (9.1%) reported an inconclusive result for A/H5 on CS
specimens using the CDC A/H5 assay. Four of the 33 confirmed cases with conjunctivitis
symptoms (15.2%) reported a positive result for A/H5 on an NPS specimen only using the
CDC A/H5 assay.
Of the two confirmed cases without conjunctivitis symptoms reported, 1/2 (50%) tested
positive for A/H5 on a CS specimen, and 1/2 (50%) tested positive for A/H5 on an NS
specimen only using the CDC A/H5 assay.
Of the two probable cases with conjunctivitis symptoms reported, 2/2 (100%) tested negative
on CS specimens using the CDC A/H5 assay.
Subject matched paired URT swab specimens (i.e., NPS, combined NS and OS, NS, and/or
OS) and CS specimens were available for testing in 32 out of 35 confirmed cases and one of
the two probable cases of A/H5N1. For three of the 35 confirmed cases and one of the two
probable cases, only CS specimens were available for testing.
Of the subject matched paired URT swab and CS specimens from 32 confirmed human cases
of A/H5N1, the CDC A/H5 assay was positive on paired URT swab (at least one URT swab
specimen is positive) and CS specimens in ten confirmed human cases (five paired NPS, four
paired combined NS and OS, and one paired NPS and combined NS and OS specimens were
positive in addition to the paired CS specimens being positive); the CDC A/H5 assay was
positive in CS specimens only in 15 confirmed cases (two paired combined NS and OS and
one paired NS specimens in three confirmed cases generated an A/H5 inconclusive result and
all other paired URT swab specimens generated a negative result); and the CDC A/H5 assay

was positive in at least one URT swab specimen only in four confirmed cases (three paired
NPS and one paired NS specimens were positive while all paired CS specimens were
negative). For three of the 32 confirmed human cases of A/H5N1 where subject matched
paired URT swab and CS specimens were available for testing, the CDC A/H5 assay
generated an A/H5 inconclusive result on paired CS specimens only while all paired URT
swab specimens were negative.
Of the subject matched paired URT swab and CS specimens from one probable human case
of A/H5N1, the CDC A/H5 assay was negative on all paired URT swab (one NPS and one
combined NS and OS specimens) and the CS specimen in this probable case.
For three of the 35 confirmed cases where only CS specimens were available for testing, the
CDC A/H5 assay was positive on the CS specimens in two confirmed cases, and
inconclusive in 1 confirmed case.
For one of the two probable cases where only a CS specimen was available for testing, the
CDC A/H5 assay generated an A/H5 negative result.
Comparisons of subject-matched paired conjunctival swab (CS) and upper respiratory tract
(URT) swab specimens (i.e., NPS, combined NS and OS, NS, and/or OS) testing results
using the CDC A/H5 assay in confirmed and probable A/H5N1 cases (n=33) across all
symptoms are presented in the two tables below.

Of the subject matched paired URT swab and CS specimens from one probable human case
of A/H5N1, the CDC A/H5 assay was negative on all paired URT swab (one NPS and one
combined NS and OS specimens) and the CS specimen in this probable case.
