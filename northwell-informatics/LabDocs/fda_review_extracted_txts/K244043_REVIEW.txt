AllTest Multi-Drug Rapid Test Cup can be a single drug test cup or used for any combination of
the above listed analytes. It is for in vitro diagnostic use only. It is intended for OTC use.
The tests may yield positive results for the prescription drugs when taken at or above prescribed
doses. It is not intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse of these drugs. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result.
The tests provide only preliminary results. To obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more
specific alternate chemical method must be used. GC/MS or LC/MS is the recommended
confirmatory method.

C Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):

D Special Instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable. (These devices are single use and disposable.)
IV Device/System Characteristics:
A Device Description:
AllTest Multi-Drug Test Cup tests are competitive binding, lateral flow immunochromatographic
assays for qualitative and simultaneous detection of Amphetamine, Buprenorphine, Secobarbital,
Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, 2- ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine,
Methamphetamine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Morphine, Methadone, Oxycodone,
Phencyclidine, Nortriptyline, Marijuana, Tramadol, Propoxyphene, Fentanyl and 6-
monoacetylmorphine in human urine. The tests provide only preliminary results. To obtain a
confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method must be used. GC/MS or
LC/MS is the recommended confirmatory method.
B Principle of Operation:
The Multi-Drug Rapid Test Cup is a rapid urine screening test that can be performed without the
use of an instrument. The test utilizes monoclonal antibodies to selectively detect elevated levels
K244043 - Page 4 of 20

--- Page 5 ---
of specific drugs in urine. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action.
A drug, if present in the urine specimen below its cut-off concentration, will not saturate the
binding sites of its specific antibody. The antibody will then react with the drug-protein
conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test region of the specific drug dipstick.
The presence of drug above the cut-off concentration will saturate all the binding sites of the
antibody. Therefore, the colored line will not form in the test region.
A drug-positive urine specimen will not generate a colored line in the specific test region of the
dipstick because of drug competition, while a drug-negative urine specimen will generate a line
in the test region because of the absence of drug competition.
To serve as a procedural control, a colored line will always appear at the control region,
indicating that proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.

VII Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
A Analytical Performance:
1. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were carried out for samples with concentrations of -100% cutoff, -75%
cutoff, -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff, cutoff, +25% cutoff, +50% cutoff, +75% cutoff and +100%
cutoff using 3 lots of the AllTest Multi-Drug Rapid Test Cup. These samples were prepared
by spiking drug in negative urine samples. Each drug concentration was confirmed by LC-
MS/MS. All sample aliquots were blindly labeled by the person who prepared the samples
and didn’t take part in the sample testing. For each concentration, tests were performed 1
replicate per run per lot (one operator per lot), 2 runs per day for 25 days in a randomized
order. The results obtained for Tramadol 100, Propoxyphene 300, Fentanyl 1 and 6-
monoacetylmorphine 10 are summarized in the following tables. The rest of the data for
Amphetamine, Buprenorphine, Secobarbital, Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, EDDP,
Methamphetamine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Morphine, Methadone, Oxycodone,
Phencyclidine, Nortriptyline and Marijuana were reported in k233019.

2. Linearity:
Not applicable.
3. Analytical Specificity/Interference:
Cross-reactivity
To test the cross reactivity, target drugs, drug metabolites within the same class of drugs, or
substances with similar molecular structures that potentially cross-react were spiked to drug-
free specimens and these samples were tested by three different operators using three lots of
Multi-Drug Rapid Test Cup. The cross-reacting substances with the lowest concentration that
produced a positive result was identified and are listed in the table below. If no cross-
reactivity was observed the highest concentration tested is shown.
The study is reported only for Tramadol (TRA)100, Propoxyphene (PPX) 300, Fentanyl
(FYL) 1 and 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM)10. The data for Amphetamine,
Buprenorphine, Secobarbital, Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, EDDP, Methamphetamine,
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Morphine, Methadone, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine,
Nortriptyline and Marijuana were reported in k233019.

Interfering substances
Clinical urine samples may contain substances that could potentially interfere with the test.
To evaluate interference, potential interfering substances found in human urine of
physiological or pathological conditions were added to drug-free urine and target drugs urine
with concentrations at 50% below and 50% above cut-off levels in the test. These urine
samples were tested using three lots of Multi-Drug Rapid Test Cup and two configurations
(combination of different cut off values) by six operators (three operator for each
configuration). Compounds that showed no interference at a concentration of 100 μg/mL or
at specified concentrations are summarized in the following table.
Acetaminophen D-Pseudoephedrine Norfentanyl
Acetone (1000mg/dL) Duloxetine Noscapine

Effect of Urine Specific Gravity and Urine pH
The effect of pH and specific gravity on the accuracy of test measurement of the Multi-Drug
Rapid Test Cup were evaluated using pooled urine specimens with concentrations of 0 (drug-
free), at 50% below and 50% above each corresponding cutoff. The results demonstrated that
pH levels of 4 to 9 and specific gravity levels of 1.000 to 1.035 do not affect the results of the
assays.

All drug calibrators of the device are traceable to available commercial reference materials.
6. Detection Limit:
See precision data in Section VII.A.1., above, for assay performance around the claimed
cutoff concentrations.
7. Assay Cut-Off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section VII.A.1., above.
B Comparison Studies:
1. Method Comparison with Predicate Device:
Eighty (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical urine samples for each drug were
analyzed by LC/MS and by three lots of Multi-Drug Rapid Test Cup device. Samples
concentrations are confirmed by LC/MS, ranging from drug-free, < -50% Cutoff, -50%
Cutoff ~ Cutoff, Cutoff ~ +50% Cutoff, >+50% Cutoff. The study was conducted by 3
operators (one operator per lot) at an in-house laboratory. Method comparison data were
reported only for Tramadol (TRA)100, Propoxyphene (PPX) 300, Fentanyl (FYL) 1 and 6-
monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM)10. The data for Amphetamine, Buprenorphine, Secobarbital,
Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, EDDP, Methamphetamine, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
Morphine, Methadone, Oxycodone, Phencyclidine, Nortriptyline and Marijuana were
reported in k233019.

Lay User Study
A lay user study was conducted to evaluate its two configurations of the 18 drugs for the
Multi-Drug Rapid Test Cup. Configuration 1 included COC 300, OPI/MOP 2000, AMP 1000
and MET 1000, AND configuration 2 included COC 150, MOP 300, AMP 500 and MET
500. The study was performed at three intended user sites by 280 lay users (140 for each
configuration), and each lay user tested only one sample. The lay users had diverse
educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 20 to > 50 years. Urine
samples were prepared at the following concentrations: -100%, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of
the cutoff by spiking drugs into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of the
samples were confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into individual
