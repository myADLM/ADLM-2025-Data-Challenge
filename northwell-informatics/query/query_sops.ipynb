    "Out of the five SOP versions retrieved, two list essentially the same numeric range (10-14 s or 11-13.5 s). The other three omit numbers and direct staff to local ranges. Because the two numeric versions agree and fall within the typical PT range found in textbooks, they are probably what the author meant; a value far outside 10-14 s is likely a typographical error.\n",
