      "Q: What are the reference (normal) ranges for serum magnesium testing?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: The Serum Magnesium SOP does not state any normal range. The closest guidance we have is from the Plasma Magnesium SOP, which lists an adult reference interval of 1.7 – 2.2 mg/dL (0.70 – 0.91 mmol/L); it notes that pediatric ranges vary by age but does not list the specific values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why: Because the serum-specific SOP is silent on reference limits, we rely on the plasma guideline as the best available approximation until a serum range is formally established.\n",
