      "2. Hemolysis in blood samples  \n",
      "   • Problem: Ruptured red cells release intracellular contents that falsely raise or lower many chemistry results, invalidating panels such as CMP/BMP.  \n",
      "   • Fix: Reject visibly hemolyzed tubes and recollect; at recollection use a gentle draw, invert—not shake—tubes, and centrifuge promptly (≈3 000 rpm, 10 min) to obtain clear serum/plasma.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Cross-contamination / specimen carry-over  \n",
      "   • Problem: Splash-over or mis-placement of cups/racks can mix specimens and give erroneous chemistry values.  \n",
      "   • Fix: Visually inspect samples and rack positions before loading; separate high-risk specimens; if QC flags or results look odd, repeat the run or recollect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why: Each error occurs in the pre-analytical phase. If tissue antigens are lost, hemoglobin floods a serum sample, or a neighboring sample contaminates another, the downstream assays cannot compensate—the only cure is proper collection, handling, and, when in doubt, recollection.\n",
