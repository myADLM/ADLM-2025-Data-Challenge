Extract entities and relationships from this FDA regulatory document using ONLY the schema below.

IMPORTANT: Entity ID Guidelines
- Generate canonical, descriptive IDs following pattern: TYPE_CanonicalName
- For FDA documents: FDA_DOC_K<number> (e.g., FDA_DOC_K060818)
- For devices: DEVICE_<ManufacturerName>_<DeviceName> (e.g., DEVICE_BIOKIT_SHBG_Assay)
- For manufacturers: MANUFACTURER_<CompanyName>
- For measurands: MEASURAND_<AnalyteName> (e.g., MEASURAND_Insulin)
- For regulatory sections: REGSECTION_21CFR<section> (e.g., REGSECTION_21CFR862_1150)
- If entity appears multiple times with different names, use the SAME ID consistently
- Entity IDs should be unique and descriptive

Return a JSON object with this structure:
{
    "@context": "https://example.org/fda-ontology/context.json",
    "@graph": [
        {
            "@id": "TYPE_CanonicalName",
            "@type": "EntityType",
            "title": "Full Canonical Name",
            "description": "Optional description or regulatory details",
            "relations": [
                {
                    "predicate": "RELATIONSHIP_TYPE",
                    "object": "target_entity_id",
                    "source_text": "supporting text from document"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

Ensure:
- All entity types match exactly the schema types
- All relationship types match exactly the schema types
- Entity IDs are canonical and consistent
- All referenced entity IDs exist in the @graph array
- Source text is provided for each relationship
- Regulatory identifiers (K-numbers, CFR sections, etc.) are preserved as-is
