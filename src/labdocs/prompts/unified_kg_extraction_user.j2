Extract entities and relationships from this document (either FDA regulatory or SOP) using ONLY the schema below.

IMPORTANT: Entity ID Guidelines
- Generate canonical, descriptive IDs following pattern: TYPE_CanonicalName
- For FDA documents: FDA_DOC_K<number>, DEVICE_<Name>, MANUFACTURER_<Name>
- For SOP documents: SOP_<Name>, ASSAY_<Name>, ANALYTE_<Name>, SPECIMEN_<Type>
- For shared entities: INSTRUMENT_<Name>, REAGENT_<Name>, STANDARD_<Name>
- Use full names, not abbreviations
- If entity appears multiple times with different names, use the SAME ID consistently

CRITICAL: Cross-Document Linking
When extracting from FDA documents, look for mentions of:
- Specific assay procedures (link to ASSAY entities)
- Test methods (link to TestType entities)
- Equipment platforms (link to INSTRUMENT entities)

When extracting from SOP documents, look for mentions of:
- Specific devices or commercial kits (link to DEVICE entities)
- Regulatory requirements (link to RegulatorySection entities)
- FDA guidance (link to GuidanceDocument entities)

Return a JSON object with this structure:
{
    "@context": "https://example.org/unified-ontology/context.json",
    "@graph": [
        {
            "@id": "TYPE_CanonicalName",
            "@type": "EntityType",
            "title": "Full Canonical Name",
            "description": "Optional description",
            "doc_type": "fda" or "sop",
            "relations": [
                {
                    "predicate": "RELATIONSHIP_TYPE",
                    "object": "target_entity_id",
                    "source_text": "supporting text from document"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

Ensure:
- All entity types match exactly the schema types
- All relationship types match exactly the schema types
- Entity IDs are canonical and consistent
- All referenced entity IDs exist in the @graph array
- Source text is provided for each relationship
- doc_type is set to either "fda" or "sop" for tracking
- Cross-document relationships (DEVICE_IMPLEMENTS_ASSAY, SOP_IMPLEMENTS_DEVICE, etc.) are used when applicable
